those of you who know me know how passionate i am about opening the space frontier so when i had the chance to give the world 's expert in gravity the experience of zero gravity it was incredible and i want to tell you that story i first met him through the archon x prize for genomics it 's a competition we 're holding the second x prize for the first team to sequence 100 human genomes in 10 days we have something called the genome 100 -- 100 individuals we 're sequencing as part of that craig venter chairs that event and i met professor hawking and he said his dream was to travel into space and i said " i ca n't take you there but i can take you into weightlessness into zero-g and he said on the spot " absolutely yes " well the only way to experience zero-g on earth is actually with parabolic flight weightless flight you take an airplane you fly over the top you 're weightless for 25 seconds come back down you weigh twice as much you do it again and again you can get eight 10 minutes of weightlessness -- how nasa 's trained their astronauts for so long we set out to do this it took us 11 years to become operational and we announced that we were going to fly stephen hawking we had one government agency and one company aircraft operator say you 're crazy do n't do that you 're going kill the guy and he wanted to go we worked hard to get all the permissions and six months later we sat down at kennedy space center we had a press conference we announced our intent to do one zero-g parabola give him 25 seconds of zero-g and if it went really well we might do three parabolas well we asked him why he wanted to go up and do this and what he said for me was very moving he said " life on earth is at an ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by disaster â€¦ i think the human race does n't have a future if it does n't go into space i therefore want to encourage public interest in space " we took him out to the kennedy space center up inside the nasa vehicle into the back of the zero-g airplane we had about 20 people who made donations -- we raised $ 150,000 in donations for children 's charities -- who flew with us a few tedsters here we set up a whole er we had four emergency room doctors and two nurses on board the airplane we were monitoring his po2 of his blood his heart rate his blood pressure we had everything all set in case of an emergency ; god knows you do n't want to hurt this world-renowned expert we took off from the shuttle landing facility where the shuttle takes off and lands and my partner byron lichtenberg and i carefully suspended him into zero-g once he was there [ we ] let him go to experience what weightlessness was truly like and after that first parabola you know the doc said everything is great he was smiling and we said go so we did a second parabola and a third we actually floated an apple in homage to sir isaac newton because professor hawking holds the same chair at cambridge that isaac newton did and we did a fourth and a fifth and a sixth and a seventh and an eighth and this man does not look like a 65-year-old wheelchair-bound man he was so happy we are living on a precious jewel and it 's during our lifetime that we 're moving off this planet please join us in this epic adventure thank you so much i 'm a writer and a journalist and i 'm also an insanely curious person so in 22 years as a journalist i 've learned how to do a lot of new things and three years ago one of the things i learned how to do was to become invisible i became one of the working homeless i quit my job as a newspaper editor after my father died in february of that same year and decided to travel his death hit me pretty hard and there were a lot of things that i wanted to feel and deal with while i was doing that i 've camped my whole life and i decided that living in a van for a year to do this would be like one long camping trip so i packed my cat my rottweiler and my camping gear into a 1975 chevy van and drove off into the sunset having fully failed to realize three critical things one : that society equates living in a permanent structure even a shack with having value as a person two : i failed to realize how quickly the negative perceptions of other people can impact our reality if we let it three : i failed to realize that homelessness is an attitude not a lifestyle at first living in the van was great i showered in campgrounds i ate out regularly and i had time to relax and to grieve but then the anger and the depression about my father 's death set in my freelance job ended and i had to get a full-time job to pay the bills what had been a really mild spring turned into a miserably hot summer and it became impossible to park anywhere -- -- without being very obvious that i had a cat and a dog with me and it was really hot the cat came and went through an open window in the van the doggy went into doggy day care and i sweated whenever i could i used employee showers in office buildings and truck stops or i washed up in public rest rooms nighttime temperatures in the van rarely dropped below 80 degrees fahrenheit making it difficult or impossible to sleep food rotted in the heat ice in my ice chest melted within hours and it was pretty miserable i could n't afford to find an apartment or could n't afford an apartment that would allow me to have the rottweiler and the cat and i refused to give them up so i stayed in the van and when the heat made me too sick to walk the 50 feet to the public restroom outside my van at night i used a bucket and a trash bag as a toilet when winter weather set in the temperatures dropped below freezing and they stayed there and i faced a whole new set of challenges i parked a different place every night so i would avoid being noticed and hassled by the police i did n't always succeed but i felt out of control of my life and i do n't know when or how it happened but the speed at which i went from being a talented writer and journalist to being a homeless woman living in a van took my breath away i had n't changed my i.q had n't dropped my talent my integrity my values everything about me remained the same but i had changed somehow i spiraled deeper and deeper into a depression and eventually someone referred me to a homeless health clinic and i went i had n't bathed in three days i was as smelly and as depressed as anyone in line i just was n't drunk or high and when several of the homeless men realized that including a former university professor they said " you are n't homeless why are you really here " other homeless people did n't see me as homeless but i did then the professor listened to my story and he said " you have a job you have hope the real homeless do n't have hope " a reaction to the medication the clinic gave me for my depression left me suicidal and i remember thinking " if i killed myself no one would notice " a friend told me shortly after that that she had heard that tim russert a nationally renowned journalist had been talking about me on national t.v an essay i 'd written about my father the year before he died was in tim 's new book and he was doing the talk show circuit and he was talking about my writing and when i realized that tim russert former moderator of " meet the press " was talking about my writing while i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot i started laughing you should too i started laughing because it got to the point where was i a writer or was i a homeless woman so i went in the bookstore and i found tim 's book and i stood there and i reread my essay and i cried because i was a writer i was a writer shortly after that i moved back to tennessee i alternated between living in a van and couch surfing with friends and i started writing again by the summer of the following year i was a working journalist i was winning awards i was living in my own apartment i was no longer homeless and i was no longer invisible thousands of people work full and part-time jobs and live in their cars but society continues to stigmatize and criminalize living in your vehicle or on the streets so the homeless the working homeless primarily remain invisible but if you ever meet one engage them encourage them and offer them hope the human spirit can overcome anything if it has hope and i 'm not here to be the poster girl for the homeless i 'm not here to encourage you to give money to the next panhandler you meet but i am here to tell you that based on my experience people are not where they live where they sleep or what their life situation is at any given time three years ago i was living in a van in a wal-mart parking lot and today i 'm speaking at ted hope always always finds a way thank you welcome to thailand now when i was a young man -- 40 years ago the country was very very poor with lots and lots and lots of people living in poverty we decided to do something about it but we did n't begin with a welfare program or a poverty reduction program but we began with a family-planning program following a very successful maternal child health activity sets of activities so basically no one would accept family planning if their children did n't survive so the first step : get to the children get to the mothers and then follow up with family planning not just child mortality alone you need also family planning now let me take you back as to why we needed to do it in my country that was the case in 1974 seven children per family -- tremendous growth at 3.3 percent there was just no future we needed to reduce the population growth rate so we said " let 's do it " the women said " we agree we 'll use pills but we need a doctor to prescribe the pills " and we had very very few doctors we did n't take no as an answer ; we took no as a question we went to the nurses and the midwives who were also women and did a fantastic job at explaining how to use the pill that was wonderful but it covered only 20 percent of the country what do we do for the other 80 percent -- leave them alone and say " well they 're not medical personnel " no we decided to do a bit more so we went to the ordinary people that you saw actually below that yellow sign -- i wish they had n't wiped that because there was " coca-cola " there we were so much bigger than coca-cola in those days and no difference the people they chose were the people we chose they were well-known in the community they knew that customers were always right and they were terrific and they practiced their family planning themselves so they could supply pills and condoms throughout the country in every village of the country so there we are we went to the people who were seen as the cause of the problem to be the solution wherever there were people -- and you can see boats with the women selling things -- here 's the floating market selling bananas and crabs and also contraceptives -- wherever you find people you 'll find contraceptives in thailand and then we decided why not get to religion because in the philippines the catholic church was pretty strong and thai people were buddhist we went to them and they said " look could you help us " i 'm there -- the one in blue not the yellow -- holding a bowl of holy water for the monk to sprinkle holy water on pills and condoms for the sanctity of the family and this picture was sent throughout the country so some of the monks in the villages were doing the same thing themselves and the women were saying " no wonder we have no side-effects it 's been blessed " that was their perception and then we went to teachers you need everybody to be involved in trying to provide whatever it is that make humanity a better place so we went to the teachers over a quarter of a million were taught about family planning with a new alphabet -- a b for birth c for condom i for iud v for vasectomy and then we had a snakes and ladders game where you throw dice if you land on anything pro-family planning you move ahead like " mother takes the pill every night very good mother move ahead uncle buys a condom very good uncle move ahead uncle gets drunk does n't use condom come back start again " again education class entertainment and the kids were doing it in school too we had relay races with condoms we had children 's condom-blowing championship and before long the condom was know as the girl 's best friend in thailand for poor people diamonds do n't make it -- so the condom is the girl 's best friend we introduced our first microcredit program in 1975 and the women who organized it said " we only want to lend to women who practice family planning if you 're pregnant take care of your pregnancy if you 're not pregnant you can take a loan out from us " and that was run by them and after 35/36 years it 's still going on it 's a part of the village development bank ; it 's not a real bank but it 's a fund -- microcredit and we did n't need a big organization to run it -- it was run by the villagers themselves and you probably hardly see a thai man there it 's always women women women women and then we thought we 'd help america because america 's been helping everyone whether they want help or not and this is on the fourth of july we decided to provide vasectomy to all men but in particular american men to the front of the queue right up to the ambassador 's residence during his [ unclear ] and the hotel gave us the ballroom for it -- very appropriate room and since it was near lunch time they said " all right we 'll give you some lunch of course it must be american cola you get two brands coke and pepsi and then the food is either hamburger or hotdog " and i thought a hotdog will be more symbolic and here is this then young man called willy bohm who worked for the usaid obviously he 's had his vasectomy because his hotdog is half eaten and he was very happy it made a lot of news in america and it angered some people also i said " do n't worry come over and i 'll do the whole lot of you " and what happened in all this thing from seven children to 1.5 children population growth rate of 3.3 to 0.5 you could call it the coca-cola approach if you like -- it was exactly the same thing i 'm not sure whether coca-cola followed us or we followed coca-cola but we 're good friends and so that 's the case of everyone joining in we did n't have a strong government we did n't have lots of doctors but it 's everybody 's job who can change attitude and behavior then aids came along and hit thailand and we had to stop doing a lot of good things to fight aids but unfortunately the government was in denial denial denial so our work was n't affected so i thought " well if you ca n't go to the government go to the military " so i went to the military and asked to borrow 300 radio stations they have more than the government and they 've got more guns than the government so i asked them could they help us in our fight against hiv and after i gave them statistics they said " yes okay you can use all the radio stations television stations " and that 's when we went onto the airwaves and then we got a new prime minister soon after that and he said " mechai could you come and join " he asked me in because he liked my wife a lot so i said " okay " he became the chairman of the national aids committee and increased the budget fifty-fold every ministry even judges had to be involved in aids education -- everyone -- and we said the public institutions religious institutions schools -- everyone was involved and here every media person had to be trained for hiv and we gave every station half a minute extra for advertising to earn more money so they were happy with that and then aids education in all schools starting from university and these are high school kids teaching high school kids and the best teachers were the girls not the boys and they were terrific and these girls who go around teaching about safe sex and hiv were known as mother theresa and then we went down one more step these are primary school kids -- third fourth grade -- going to every household in the village every household in the whole of thailand giving aids information and a condom to every household given by these young kids and no parents objected because we were trying to save lives and this was a lifesaver and we said " everyone needs to be involved " so you have the companies also realizing that sick staff do n't work and dead customers do n't buy so they all trained and then we have this captain condom with his harvard mba going to schools and night spots and they loved him you need a symbol of something in every country every program you need a symbol and this is probably the best thing he 's ever done with his mba and then we gave condoms out everywhere on the streets -- everywhere everywhere in taxis you get condoms and also in traffic the policemen give you condoms -- our " cops and rubbers " programs so can you imagine new york policemen giving out condoms of course i can and they 'd enjoy it immensely ; i see them standing around right now everywhere imagine if they had condoms giving out to all sorts of people and then new change we had hair bands clothing and the condom for your mobile phone during the rainy season and these were the condoms that we introduced one says " weapon of mass protection " we found -- you know -- somebody here was searching for the weapon of mass destruction but we have found the weapon of mass protection : the condom and then it says here with the american flag " do n't leave home without it " but i have some to give out afterward but let me warn you these are thai-sized so be very careful and so you can see that condoms can do so many things look at this -- i gave this to al gore and to bill senior also stop global warming ; use condoms and then this is the picture i mentioned to you -- the weapon of mass protection and let the next olympics save some lives why just run around and then finally in thailand we 're buddhist we do n't have a god so instead we say " in rubber we trust " so you can see that we added everything to our endeavor to make life better for the people we had condoms in all the refrigerators in the hotels and the schools because alcohol impairs judgment and then what happened after all this time everybody joined in according to the u.n. new cases of hiv declined by 90 percent and according to the world bank 7.7 million lives were saved otherwise there would n't be many thais walking around today so it just showed you you could do something about it 90 percent of the funding came from thailand there was political commitment some financial commitment and everybody joined in the fight so just do n't leave it to the specialists and doctors and nurses we all need to help and then we decided to help people out of poverty now that we got aids somewhat out of the way -- this time not with government alone but in cooperation with the business community because poor people are business people who lack business skills and access to credit those are the things to be provided by the business community we 're trying to turn them into barefoot entrepreneurs little business people the only way out of poverty is through business enterprise so that was done the money goes from the company into the village via tree-planting it 's not a free gift they plant the trees and the money goes into their microcredit fund which we call the village development bank everybody joins in and they feel they own the bank because they have brought the money in and before you can borrow the money you need to be trained and we believe if you want to help the poor those who are living in poverty access to credit must be a human right access to credit must be a human right otherwise they 'll never get out of poverty and then before getting a loan you must be trained here 's what we call a " barefoot mba " teaching people how to do business so that when they borrow money they 'll succeed with the business these are some of the businesses : mushrooms crabs vegetables trees fruits and this is very interesting -- nike ice cream and nike biscuits ; this is a village sponsored by nike they said " they should stop making shoes and clothes make these better because we can afford them " and then we have silk thai silk now we 're making scottish tartans as you can see on the left to sell to all people of scottish ancestors so anyone sitting in and watching tv get in touch with me and then this is our answer to starbucks in thailand -- " coffee and condoms " see starbucks you awake we keep you awake and alive that 's the difference can you imagine at every starbucks that you can also get condoms you can order your condoms with your with your cappuccino and then now finally in education we want to change the school as being underutilized into a place where it 's a lifelong learning center for everyone we call this our school-based integrated rural development and it 's a center a focal point for economic and social development re-do the school make it serve the community needs and here is a bamboo building -- all of them are bamboo this is a geodesic dome made of bamboo and i 'm sure buckminster fuller would be very very proud to see a bamboo geodesic dome and we use vegetables around the school ground so they raise their own vegetables and then finally i firmly believe if we want the mdgs to work -- the millennium development goals -- we need to add family planning to it of course child mortality first and then family planning -- everyone needs family planning service -- it 's underutilized so we have now found the weapon of mass protection and we also ask the next olympics to be involved in saving lives and then finally that is our network and these are our thai tulips thank you very much indeed thank you so much it 's really scary to be here among the smartest of the smart i 'm here to tell you a few tales of passion there 's a jewish saying that i love what is truer than truth answer : the story i 'm a storyteller i want to convey something that is truer than truth about our common humanity all stories interest me and some haunt me until i end up writing them certain themes keep coming up : justice loyalty violence death political and social issues freedom i 'm aware of the mystery around us so i write about coincidences premonitions emotions dreams the power of nature magic in the last 20 years i have published a few books but i have lived in anonymity until february of 2006 when i carried the olympic flag in the winter olympics in italy that made me a celebrity now people recognize me in macy 's and my grandchildren think that i 'm cool allow me to tell you about my four minutes of fame one of the organizers of the olympic ceremony of the opening ceremony called me and said that i had been selected to be one of the flag-bearers i replied that surely this was a case of mistaken identity because i 'm as far as you can get from being an athlete actually i was n't even sure that i could go around the stadium without a walker i was told that this was no laughing matter this would be the first time that only women would carry the olympic flag five women representing five continents and three olympic gold medal winners my first question was naturally what was i going to wear a uniform she said and asked for my measurements my measurements i had a vision of myself in a fluffy anorak looking like the michelin man by the middle of february i found myself in turin where enthusiastic crowds cheered when any of the 80 olympic teams was in the street those athletes had sacrificed everything to compete in the games they all deserved to win but there 's the element of luck a speck of snow an inch of ice the force of the wind can determine the result of a race or a game however what matters most -- more than training or luck -- is the heart only a fearless and determined heart will get the gold medal it is all about passion the streets of turin were covered with red posters announcing the slogan of the olympics passion lives here is n't it always true heart is what drives us and determines our fate that is what i need for my characters in my books : a passionate heart i need mavericks dissidents adventurers outsiders and rebels who ask questions bend the rules and take risks people like all of you in this room nice people with common sense do not make interesting characters they only make good former spouses in the green room of the stadium i met the other flag bearers : three athletes and the actresses susan sarandon and sophia loren also two women with passionate hearts : wangari maathai the nobel prizewinner from kenya who has planted 30 million trees and by doing so she has changed the soil the weather in some places in africa and of course the economic conditions in many villages and somaly mam a cambodian activist who fights passionately against child prostitution when she was 14 years old her grandfather sold her to a brothel she told us of little girls raped by men who believe that having sex with a very young virgin will cure them from aids and of brothels where children are forced to receive five 15 clients per day and if they rebel they are tortured with electricity in the green room i received my uniform it was not the kind of outfit that i normally wear but it was far from the michelin man suit that i had anticipated not bad really i looked like a refrigerator but so did most of the flag-bearers except sophia loren the universal symbol of beauty and passion sophia is over 70 and she looks great she 's sexy slim and tall with a deep tan now how can you have a deep tan and have no wrinkles i do n't know when asked in a tv interview " how could she look so good " she replied " posture my back is always straight and i do n't make old people 's noises " so there you have some free advice from one of the most beautiful women on earth no grunting no coughing no wheezing no talking to yourselves no farting well she did n't say that exactly at some point around midnight we were summoned to the wings of the stadium and the loudspeakers announced the olympic flag and the music started -- by the way the same music that starts here the aida march sophia loren was right in front of me -- she 's a foot taller than i am not counting the poofy hair she walked elegantly like a giraffe on the african savannah holding the flag on her shoulder i jogged behind -- on my tiptoes -- holding the flag on my extended arm so that my head was actually under the damn flag all the cameras were of course on sophia that was fortunate for me because in most press photos i appear too although often between sophia 's legs a place where most men would love to be the best four minutes of my entire life were those in the olympic stadium my husband is offended when i say this -- although i have explained to him that what we do in private usually takes less than four minutes -- -- so he should n't take it personally i have all the press clippings of those four magnificent minutes because i do n't want to forget them when old age destroys my brain cells i want to carry in my heart forever the key word of the olympics -- passion so here 's a tale of passion the year is 1998 the place is a prison camp for tutsi refugees in congo by the way 80 percent of all refugees and displaced people in the world are women and girls we can call this place in congo a death camp because those who are not killed will die of disease or starvation the protagonists of this story are a young woman rose mapendo and her children she 's pregnant and a widow soldiers have forced her to watch as her husband was tortured and killed somehow she manages to keep her seven children alive and a few months later she gives birth to premature twins two tiny little boys she cuts the umbilical cord with a stick and ties it with her own hair she names the twins after the camp 's commanders to gain their favor and feeds them with black tea because her milk can not sustain them when the soldiers burst in her cell to rape her oldest daughter she grabs hold of her and refuses to let go even when they hold a gun to her head somehow the family survives for 16 months and then by extraordinary luck and the passionate heart of a young american man sasha chanoff who manages to put her in a u.s. rescue plane rose mapendo and her nine children end up in phoenix arizona where they 're now living and thriving mapendo in swahili means great love the protagonists of my books are strong and passionate women like rose mapendo i do n't make them up there 's no need for that i look around and i see them everywhere i have worked with women and for women all my life i know them well i was born in ancient times at the end of the world in a patriarchal catholic and conservative family no wonder that by age five i was a raging feminist -- although the term had not reached chile yet so nobody knew what the heck was wrong with me i would soon find out that there was a high price to pay for my freedom and for questioning the patriarchy but i was happy to pay it because for every blow that i received i was able to deliver two once when my daughter paula was in her twenties she said to me that feminism was dated that i should move on we had a memorable fight feminism is dated yes for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage prostitution forced labor -- they have children that they do n't want or they can not feed they have no control over their bodies or their lives they have no education and no freedom they are raped beaten up and sometimes killed with impunity for most western young women of today being called a feminist is an insult feminism has never been sexy but let me assure you that it never stopped me from flirting and i have seldom suffered from lack of men feminism is not dead by no means it has evolved if you do n't like the term change it for goddess ' sake call it aphrodite or venus or bimbo or whatever you want ; the name does n't matter as long as we understand what it is about and we support it so here 's another tale of passion and this is a sad one the place is a small women 's clinic in a village in bangladesh the year is 2005 jenny is a young american dental hygienist who has gone to the clinic as a volunteer during her three-week vacation she 's prepared to clean teeth but when she gets there she finds out that there are no doctors no dentists and the clinic is just a hut full of flies outside there is a line of women who have waited several hours to be treated the first patient is in excruciating pain because she has several rotten molars jenny realizes that the only solution is to pull out the bad teeth she 's not licensed for that ; she has never done it she risks a lot and she 's terrified she does n't even have the proper instruments but fortunately she has brought some novocaine jenny has a brave and passionate heart she murmurs a prayer and she goes ahead with the operation at the end the relieved patient kisses her hands that day the hygienist pulls out many more teeth the next morning when she comes again to the so-called clinic her first patient is waiting for her with her husband the woman 's face looks like a watermelon it is so swollen that you ca n't even see the eyes the husband furious threatens to kill the american jenny is horrified at what she has done but then the translator explains that the patient 's condition has nothing to do with the operation the day before her husband beat her up because she was not home in time to prepare dinner for him millions of women live like this today they are the poorest of the poor although women do two-thirds of the world 's labor they own less than one percent of the world 's assets they are paid less than men for the same work if they 're paid at all and they remain vulnerable because they have no economic independence and they are constantly threatened by exploitation violence and abuse it is a fact that giving women education work the ability to control their own income inherit and own property benefits the society if a woman is empowered her children and her family will be better off if families prosper the village prospers and eventually so does the whole country wangari maathai goes to a village in kenya she talks with the women and explains that the land is barren because they have cut and sold the trees she gets the women to plant new trees and water them drop by drop in a matter of five or six years they have a forest the soil is enriched and the village is saved the poorest and most backward societies are always those that put women down yet this obvious truth is ignored by governments and also by philanthropy for every dollar given to a women 's program 20 dollars are given to men 's programs women are 51 percent of humankind empowering them will change everything -- more than technology and design and entertainment i can promise you that women working together -- linked informed and educated -- can bring peace and prosperity to this forsaken planet in any war today most of the casualties are civilians mainly women and children they are collateral damage men run the world and look at the mess we have what kind of world do we want this is a fundamental question that most of us are asking does it make sense to participate in the existing world order we want a world where life is preserved and the quality of life is enriched for everybody not only for the privileged in january i saw an exhibit of fernando botero 's paintings at the uc berkeley library no museum or gallery in the united states except for the new york gallery that carries botero 's work has dared to show the paintings because the theme is the abu ghraib prison they are huge paintings of torture and abuse of power in the voluminous botero style i have not been able to get those images out of my mind or my heart what i fear most is power with impunity i fear abuse of power and the power to abuse in our species the alpha males define reality and force the rest of the pack to accept that reality and follow the rules the rules change all the time but they always benefit them and in this case the trickle-down effect which does not work in economics works perfectly abuse trickles down from the top of the ladder to the bottom women and children especially the poor are at the bottom even the most destitute of men have someone they can abuse -- a woman or a child i 'm fed up with the power that a few exert over the many through gender income race and class i think that the time is ripe to make fundamental changes in our civilization but for real change we need feminine energy in the management of the world we need a critical number of women in positions of power and we need to nurture the feminine energy in men i 'm talking about men with young minds of course old guys are hopeless ; we have to wait for them to die off yes i would love to have sophia loren 's long legs and legendary breasts but given a choice i would rather have the warrior hearts of wangari maathai somaly mam jenny and rose mapendo i want to make this world good not better but to make it good why not it is possible look around in this room -- all this knowledge energy talent and technology let 's get off our fannies roll up our sleeves and get to work passionately in creating an almost perfect world thank you thank you for putting up these pictures of my colleagues over here we 'll be talking about them now i 'm going try an experiment i do n't do experiments normally i 'm a theorist but i 'm going see what happens if i press this button sure enough ok i used to work in this field of elementary particles what happens to matter if you chop it up very fine what is it made of and the laws of these particles are valid throughout the universe and they 're very much connected with the history of the universe we know a lot about four forces there must be a lot more but those are at very very small distances and we have n't really interacted with them very much yet the main thing i want to talk about is this : that we have this remarkable experience in this field of fundamental physics that beauty is a very successful criterion for choosing the right theory and why on earth could that be so well here 's an example from my own experience it 's fairly dramatic actually to have this happen three or four of us in 1957 put forward a partially complete theory of one of these forces this weak force and it was in disagreement with seven -- seven count them seven experiments experiments were all wrong and we published before knowing that because we figured it was so beautiful it 's got ta be right ! the experiments had to be wrong and they were now our friend over there albert einstein used to pay very little attention when people said " you know there 's a man with an experiment that seems to disagree with special relativity dc miller what about that " and he would say " aw that 'll go away " now why does stuff like that work that 's the question now yeah what do we mean by beautiful that 's one thing i 'll try to make that clear -- partially clear why should it work and is this something to do with human beings i 'll let you in on the answer to the last one that i offer and that is it has nothing to do with human beings somewhere in some other planet orbiting some very distant star maybe in a another galaxy there could well be entities that are at least as intelligent as we are and are interested in science it 's not impossible ; i think there probably are lots very likely none is close enough to interact with us but they could be out there very easily and suppose they have you know very different sensory apparatus and so on they have seven tentacles and they have 14 little funny-looking compound eyes and a brain shaped like a pretzel would they really have different laws there are lots of people who believe that and i think it is utter baloney i think there are laws out there and we of course do n't understand them at any given time very well -- but we try and we try to get closer and closer and someday we may actually figure out the fundamental unified theory of the particles and forces what i call the " fundamental law " we may not even be terribly far from it but even if we do n't run across it in our lifetimes we can still think there is one out there and we 're just trying to get closer and closer to it i think that 's the main point to be made we express these things mathematically and when the mathematics is very simple -- when in terms of some mathematical notation you can write the theory in a very brief space without a lot of complication -- that 's essentially what we mean by beauty or elegance here 's what i was saying about the laws they 're really there newton certainly believed that and he said here " it is the business of natural philosophy to find out those laws " the basic law let 's say -- here 's an assumption the assumption is that the basic law really takes the form of a unified theory of all the particles now some people call that a theory of everything that 's wrong because the theory is quantum mechanical and i wo n't go into a lot of stuff about quantum mechanics and what it 's like and so on you 've heard a lot of wrong things about it anyway there are even movies about it with a lot of wrong stuff but the main thing here is that it predicts probabilities now sometimes those probabilities are near certainties and in a lot of familiar cases they of course are but other times they 're not and you have only probabilities for different outcomes so what that means is that the history of the universe is not determined just by the fundamental law it 's the fundamental law and this incredibly long series of accidents or chance outcomes that are there in addition and the fundamental theory does n't include those chance outcomes ; they are in addition so it 's not a theory of everything and in fact a huge amount of the information in the universe around us comes from those accidents and not just from the fundamental laws now it 's often said that getting closer and closer to the fundamental laws by examining phenomena at low energies and then higher energies and then higher energies or short distances and then shorter distances and then still shorter distances and so on is like peeling the skin of an onion and we keep doing that and build more powerful machines accelerators for particles we look deeper and deeper into the structure of particles and in that way we get probably closer and closer to this fundamental law now what happens is that as we do that as we peel these skins of the onion and we get closer and closer to the underlying law we see that each skin has something in common with the previous one and with the next one we write them out mathematically and we see they use very similar mathematics they require very similar mathematics that is absolutely remarkable and that is a central feature of what i 'm trying to say today newton called it -- that 's newton by the way -- that one this one is albert einstein hi al ! and anyway he said " nature conformable to herself " -- personifying nature as a female and so what happens is that the new phenomena the new skins the inner skins of the slightly smaller skins of the onion that we get to resemble the slightly larger ones and the kind of mathematics that we had for the previous skin is almost the same as what we need for the next skin and that 's why the equations look so simple because they use mathematics we already have a trivial example is this : newton found the law of gravity which goes like one over the square of the distance between the things gravitated coulomb in france found the same law for electric charges here 's an example of this similarity you look at gravity you see a certain law then you look at electricity sure enough the same rule it 's a very simple example there are lots of more sophisticated examples symmetry is very important in this discussion you know what it means a circle for example is symmetric under rotations about the center of the circle you rotate around the center of the circle the circle remains unchanged you take a sphere in three dimensions you rotate around the center of the sphere and all those rotations leave the sphere alone they are symmetries of the sphere so we say in general that there 's a symmetry under certain operations if those operations leave the phenomenon or its description unchanged maxwell 's equations are of course symmetrical under rotations of all of space does n't matter if we turn the whole of space around by some angle it does n't leave the -- does n't change the phenomenon of electricity or magnetism there 's a new notation in the 19th century that expressed this and if you use that notation the equations get a lot simpler then einstein with his special theory of relativity looked at a whole set of symmetries of maxwell 's equations which are called special relativity and those symmetries then make the equations even shorter and even prettier therefore let 's look you do n't have to know what these things mean does n't make any difference but you can just look at the form you can look at the form you see above at the top a long list of equations with three components for the three directions of space : x y and z then using vector analysis you use rotational symmetry and you get this next set then you use the symmetry of special relativity and you get an even simpler set down here showing that symmetry exhibits better and better the more and more symmetry you have the better you exhibit the simplicity and elegance of the theory the last two the first equation says that electric charges and currents give rise to all the electric and magnetic fields the next -- second -- equation says that there is no magnetism other than that the only magnetism comes from electric charges and currents someday we may find some slight hole in that argument but for the moment that 's the case now here is a very exciting development that many people have not heard of they should have heard of it but it 's a little tricky to explain in technical detail so i wo n't do it i 'll just mention it but chen ning yang called by us " frank " yang -- -- and bob mills put forward 50 years ago this generalization of maxwell 's equations with a new symmetry a whole new symmetry mathematics very similar but there was a whole new symmetry they hoped that this would contribute somehow to particle physics -- did n't it did n't by itself contribute to particle physics but then some of us generalized it further and then it did ! and it gave a very beautiful description of the strong force and of the weak force so here we say again what we said before : that each skin of the onion shows a similarity to the adjoining skins so the mathematics for the adjoining skins is very similar to what we need for the new one and therefore it looks beautiful because we already know how to write it in a lovely concise way so here are the themes we believe there is a unified theory underlying all the regularities steps toward unification exhibit the simplicity symmetry exhibits the simplicity and then there is self-similarity across the scales -- in other words from one skin of the onion to another one proximate self-similarity and that accounts for this phenomenon that will account for why beauty is a successful criterion for selecting the right theory here 's what newton himself said : " nature is very consonant and conformable to her self " one thing he was thinking of is something that most of us take for granted today but in his day it was n't taken for granted there 's the story which is not absolutely certain to be right but a lot of people told it four sources told it that when they had the plague in cambridge and he went down to his mother 's farm -- because the university was closed -- he saw an apple fall from a tree or on his head or something and he realized suddenly that the force that drew the apple down to the earth could be the same as the force regulating the motions of the planets and the moon that was a big unification for those days although today we take it for granted it 's the same theory of gravity so he said that this principle of nature consonance : " this principle of nature being very remote from the conceptions of philosophers i forbore to describe it in that book lest i should be accounted an extravagant freak â€¦ " that 's what we all have to watch out for especially at this meeting " â€¦ and so prejudice my readers against all those things which were the main design of the book " now who today would claim that as a mere conceit of the human mind that the force that causes the apple to fall to the ground is the same force that causes the planets and the moon to move around and so on everybody knows that it 's a property of gravitation it 's not something in the human mind the human mind can of course appreciate it and enjoy it use it but it 's not -- it does n't stem from the human mind it stems from the character of gravity and that 's true of all the things we 're talking about they are properties of the fundamental law the fundamental law is such that the different skins of the onion resemble one another and therefore the math for one skin allows you to express beautifully and simply the phenomenon of the next skin i say here that newton did a lot of things that year : gravity the laws of motion the calculus white light composed of all the colors of the rainbow and he could have written quite an essay on " what i did over my summer vacation " so we do n't have to assume these principles as separate metaphysical postulates they follow from the fundamental theory they are what we call emergent properties you do n't need -- you do n't need something more to get something more that 's what emergence means life can emerge from physics and chemistry plus a lot of accidents the human mind can arise from neurobiology and a lot of accidents the way the chemical bond arises from physics and certain accidents it does n't diminish the importance of these subjects to know that they follow from more fundamental things plus accidents that 's a general rule and it 's critically important to realize that you do n't need something more in order to get something more people keep asking that when they read my book " the quark and the jaguar " and they say " is n't there something more beyond what you have there " presumably they mean something supernatural anyway there is n't you do n't need something more to explain something more thank you very much for years i 've been feeling frustrated because as a religious historian i 've become acutely aware of the centrality of compassion in all the major world faiths every single one of them has evolved their own version of what 's been called the golden rule sometimes it comes in a positive version -- " always treat all others as you 'd like to be treated yourself " and equally important is the negative version -- " do n't do to others what you would not like them to do to you " look into your own heart discover what it is that gives you pain and then refuse under any circumstance whatsoever to inflict that pain on anybody else and people have emphasized the importance of compassion not just because it sounds good but because it works people have found that when they have implemented the golden rule as confucius said " all day and every day " not just a question of doing your good deed for the day and then returning to a life of greed and egotism but to do it all day and every day you dethrone yourself from the center of your world put another there and you transcend yourself and it brings you into the presence of what 's been called god nirvana rama tao something that goes beyond what we know in our ego-bound existence but you know you 'd never know it a lot of the time that this was so central to the religious life because with a few wonderful exceptions very often when religious people come together religious leaders come together they 're arguing about abstruse doctrines or uttering a council of hatred or inveighing against homosexuality or something of that sort often people do n't really want to be compassionate i sometimes see when i 'm speaking to a congregation of religious people a sort of mutinous expression crossing their faces because people often want to be right instead and that of course defeats the object of the exercise now why was i so grateful to ted because they took me very gently from my book-lined study and brought me into the 21st century enabling me to speak to a much much wider audience than i could have ever conceived because i feel an urgency about this if we do n't manage to implement the golden rule globally so that we treat all peoples wherever and whoever they may be as though they were as important as ourselves i doubt that we 'll have a viable world to hand on to the next generation the task of our time one of the great tasks of our time is to build a global society as i said where people can live together in peace and the religions that should be making a major contribution are instead seen as part of the problem and of course it 's not just religious people who believe in the golden rule this is the source of all morality this imaginative act of empathy putting yourself in the place of another and so we have a choice it seems to me we can either go on bringing out or emphasizing the dogmatic and intolerant aspects of our faith or we can go back to the rabbis rabbi hillel the older contemporary of jesus who when asked by a pagan to sum up the whole of jewish teaching while he stood on one leg said " that which is hateful to you do not do to your neighbor that is the torah and everything else is only commentary " and the rabbis and the early fathers of the church who said that any interpretation of scripture that bred hatred and disdain was illegitimate and we need to revive that spirit and it 's not just going to happen because a spirit of love wafts us down we have to make this happen and we can do it with the modern communications that ted has introduced already i 've been tremendously heartened at the response of all our partners in singapore we have a group going to use the charter to heal divisions recently that have sprung up in singaporean society and some members of the parliament want to implement it politically in malaysia there is going to be an art exhibition in which leading artists are going to be taking people young people and showing them that compassion also lies at the root of all art throughout europe the muslim communities are holding events and discussions are discussing the centrality of compassion in islam and in all faiths but it ca n't stop there it ca n't stop with the launch religious teaching this is where we 've gone so wrong concentrating solely on believing abstruse doctrines religious teaching must always lead to action and i intend to work on this till my dying day and i want to continue with our partners to do two things -- educate and stimulate compassionate thinking education because we 've so dropped out of compassion people often think it simply means feeling sorry for somebody but of course you do n't understand compassion if you 're just going to think about it you also have to do it i want them to get the media involved because the media are crucial in helping to dissolve some of the stereotypical views we have of other people which are dividing us from one another the same applies to educators i 'd like youth to get a sense of the dynamism the dynamic and challenge of a compassionate lifestyle and also see that it demands acute intelligence not just a gooey feeling i 'd like to call upon scholars to explore the compassionate theme in their own and in other people 's traditions and perhaps above all to encourage a sensitivity about uncompassionate speaking so that because people have this charter whatever their beliefs or lack of them they feel empowered to challenge uncompassionate speech disdainful remarks from their religious leaders their political leaders from the captains of industry because we can change the world we have the ability i would never have thought of putting the charter online i was still stuck in the old world of a whole bunch of boffins sitting together in a room and issuing yet another arcane statement and ted introduced me to a whole new way of thinking and presenting ideas because that is what is so wonderful about ted in this room all this expertise if we joined it all together we could change the world and of course the problems sometimes seem insuperable but i 'd just like to quote finish at the end with a reference to a british author an oxford author whom i do n't quote very often c.s lewis but he wrote one thing that stuck in my mind ever since i read it when i was a schoolgirl it 's in his book " the four loves " he said that he distinguished between erotic love when two people gaze spellbound into each other 's eyes and then he compared that to friendship when two people stand side by side as it were shoulder to shoulder with their eyes fixed on a common goal we do n't have to fall in love with each other but we can become friends and i am convinced i felt it very strongly during our little deliberations at vevey that when people of all different persuasions come together working side by side for a common goal differences melt away and we learn amity and we learn to live together and to get to know one another thank you very much how do you feed a city it 's one of the great questions of our time yet it 's one that 's rarely asked we take it for granted that if we go into a shop or restaurant or indeed into this theater 's foyer in about an hour 's time there is going to be food there waiting for us having magically come from somewhere but when you think that every day for a city the size of london enough food has to be produced transported bought and sold cooked eaten disposed of and that something similar has to happen every day for every city on earth it 's remarkable that cities get fed at all we live in places like this as if they 're the most natural things in the world forgetting that because we 're animals and that we need to eat we 're actually as dependent on the natural world as our ancient ancestors were and as more of us move into cities more of that natural world is being transformed into extraordinary landscapes like the one behind me -- it 's soybean fields in mato grosso in brazil -- in order to feed us these are extraordinary landscapes but few of us ever get to see them and increasingly these landscapes are not just feeding us either as more of us move into cities more of us are eating meat so that a third of the annual grain crop globally now gets fed to animals rather than to us human animals and given that it takes three times as much grain -- actually ten times as much grain -- to feed a human if it 's passed through an animal first that 's not a very efficient way of feeding us and it 's an escalating problem too by 2050 it 's estimated that twice the number of us are going to be living in cities and it 's also estimated that there is going to be twice as much meat and dairy consumed so meat and urbanism are rising hand in hand and that 's going to pose an enormous problem six billion hungry carnivores to feed by 2050 that 's a big problem and actually if we carry on as we are it 's a problem we 're very unlikely to be able to solve nineteen million hectares of rainforest are lost every year to create new arable land although at the same time we 're losing an equivalent amount of existing arables to salinization and erosion we 're very hungry for fossil fuels too it takes about 10 calories to produce every calorie of food that we consume in the west and even though there is food that we are producing at great cost we do n't actually value it half the food produced in the usa is currently thrown away and to end all of this at the end of this long process we 're not even managing to feed the planet properly a billion of us are obese while a further billion starve none of it makes very much sense and when you think that 80 percent of global trade in food now is controlled by just five multinational corporations it 's a grim picture as we 're moving into cities the world is also embracing a western diet and if we look to the future it 's an unsustainable diet so how did we get here and more importantly what are we going to do about it well to answer the slightly easier question first about 10,000 years ago i would say is the beginning of this process in the ancient near east known as the fertile crescent because as you can see it was crescent shaped and it was also fertile and it was here about 10,000 years ago that two extraordinary inventions agriculture and urbanism happened roughly in the same place and at the same time this is no accident because agriculture and cities are bound together they need each other because it was discovery of grain by our ancient ancestors for the first time that produced a food source that was large enough and stable enough to support permanent settlements and if we look at what those settlements were like we see they were compact they were surrounded by productive farm land and dominated by large temple complexes like this one at ur that were in fact effectively spiritualized central food distribution centers because it was the temples that organized the harvest gathered in the grain offered it to the gods and then offered the grain that the gods did n't eat back to the people so if you like the whole spiritual and physical life of these cities was dominated by the grain and the harvest that sustained them and in fact that 's true of every ancient city but of course not all of them were that small famously rome had about a million citizens by the first century a.d so how did a city like this feed itself the answer is what i call " ancient food miles " basically rome had access to the sea which made it possible for it to import food from a very long way away this is the only way it was possible to do this in the ancient world because it was very difficult to transport food over roads which were rough and the food obviously went off very quickly so rome effectively waged war on places like carthage and egypt just to get its paws on their grain reserves and in fact you could say that the expansion of the empire was really sort of one long drawn out militarized shopping spree really in fact -- i love the fact i just have to mention this : rome in fact used to import oysters from london at one stage i think that 's extraordinary so rome shaped its hinterland through its appetite but the interesting thing is that the other thing also happened in the pre-industrial world if we look at a map of london in the 17th century we can see that its grain which is coming in from the thames along the bottom of this map so the grain markets were to the south of the city and the roads leading up from them to cheapside which was the main market were also grain markets and if you look at the name of one of those streets bread street you can tell what was going on there 300 years ago and the same of course was true for fish fish was of course coming in by river as well same thing and of course billingsgate famously was london 's fish market operating on-site here until the mid-1980s which is extraordinary really when you think about it everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port this is another thing about food in cities : once its roots into the city are established they very rarely move meat is a very different story because of course animals could walk into the city so much of london 's meat was coming from the northwest from scotland and wales so it was coming in and arriving at the city at the northwest which is why smithfield london 's very famous meat market was located up there poultry was coming in from east anglia and so on to the northeast i feel a bit like a weather woman doing this anyway and so the birds were coming in with their feet protected with little canvas shoes and then when they hit the eastern end of cheapside that 's where they were sold which is why it 's called poultry and in fact if you look at the map of any city built before the industrial age you can trace food coming in to it you can actually see how it was physically shaped by food both by reading the names of the streets which give you a lot of clues friday street in a previous life is where you went to buy your fish on a friday but also you have to imagine it full of food because the streets and the public spaces were the only places where food was bought and sold and if we look at an image of smithfield in 1830 you can see that it would have been very difficult to live in a city like this and be unaware of where your food came from in fact if you were having sunday lunch the chances were it was mooing or bleating outside your window about three days earlier so this was obviously an organic city part of an organic cycle and then 10 years later everything changed this is an image of the great western in 1840 and as you can see some of the earliest train passengers were pigs and sheep so all of a sudden these animals are no longer walking into market they 're being slaughtered out of sight and mind somewhere in the countryside and they 're coming into the city by rail and this changes everything to start off with it makes it possible for the first time to grow cities really any size and shape in any place cities used to be constrained by geography ; they used to have to get their food through very difficult physical means all of a sudden they are effectively emancipated from geography and as you can see from these maps of london in the 90 years after the trains came it goes from being a little blob that was quite easy to feed by animals coming in on foot and so on to a large splurge that would be very very difficult to feed with anybody on foot either animals or people and of course that was just the beginning after the trains came cars and really this marks the end of this process it 's the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all and this is the kind of city that 's devoid of smell devoid of mess certainly devoid of people because nobody would have dreamed of walking in such a landscape in fact what they did to get food was they got in their cars drove to a box somewhere on the outskirts came back with a week 's worth of shopping and wondered what on earth to do with it and this really is the moment when our relationship both with food and cities changes completely here we have food -- that used to be the center the social core of the city -- at the periphery it used to be a social event buying and selling food now it 's anonymous we used to cook ; now we just add water or a little bit of an egg if you 're making a cake or something we do n't smell food to see if it 's okay to eat we just read the back of a label on a packet and we do n't value food we do n't trust it so instead of trusting it we fear it and instead of valuing it we throw it away one of the great ironies of modern food systems is that they 've made the very thing they promised to make easier much harder by making it possible to build cities anywhere and any place they 've actually distanced us from our most important relationship which is that of us and nature and also they 've made us dependent on systems that only they can deliver that as we 've seen are unsustainable so what are we going to do about that it 's not a new question 500 years ago it 's what thomas more was asking himself this is the frontispiece of his book " utopia " and it was a series of semi-independent city-states if that sounds remotely familiar a day 's walk from one another where everyone was basically farming-mad and grew vegetables in their back gardens and ate communal meals together and so on and i think you could argue that food is a fundamental ordering principle of utopia even though more never framed it that way and here is another very famous " utopian " vision that of ebenezer howard " the garden city " same idea : series of semi-independent city-states little blobs of metropolitan stuff with arable land around joined to one another by railway and again food could be said to be the ordering principle of his vision it even got built but nothing to do with this vision that howard had and that is the problem with these utopian ideas that they are utopian utopia was actually a word that thomas moore used deliberately it was a kind of joke because it 's got a double derivation from the greek it can either mean a good place or no place because it 's an ideal it 's an imaginary thing we ca n't have it and i think as a conceptual tool for thinking about the very deep problem of human dwelling that makes it not much use so i 've come up with an alternative which is sitopia from the ancient greek " sitos " for food and " topos " for place i believe we already live in sitopia we live in a world shaped by food and if we realize that we can use food as a really powerful tool -- a conceptual tool design tool to shape the world differently so if we were to do that what might sitopia look like well i think it looks a bit like this i have to use this slide it 's just the look on the face of the dog but anyway this is -- it 's food at the center of life at the center of family life being celebrated being enjoyed people taking time for it this is where food should be in our society but you ca n't have scenes like this unless you have people like this by the way these can be men as well it 's people who think about food who think ahead who plan who can stare at a pile of raw vegetables and actually recognize them we need these people we 're part of a network because without these kinds of people we ca n't have places like this here i deliberately chose this because it is a man buying a vegetable but networks markets where food is being grown locally it 's common it 's fresh it 's part of the social life of the city because without that you ca n't have this kind of place food that is grown locally and also is part of the landscape and is not just a zero-sum commodity off in some unseen hell-hole cows with a view steaming piles of humus this is basically bringing the whole thing together and this is a community project i visited recently in toronto it 's a greenhouse where kids get told all about food and growing their own food here is a plant called kevin or maybe it 's a plant belonging to a kid called kevin i do n't know but anyway these kinds of projects that are trying to reconnect us with nature is extremely important so sitopia for me is really a way of seeing it 's basically recognizing that sitopia already exists in little pockets everywhere the trick is to join them up to use food as a way of seeing and if we do that we 're going to stop seeing cities as big metropolitan unproductive blobs like this we 're going to see them more like this as part of the productive organic framework of which they are inevitably a part symbiotically connected but of course that 's not a great image either because we need not to be producing food like this anymore we need to be thinking more about permaculture which is why i think this image just sums up for me the kind of thinking we need to be doing it 's a re-conceptualization of the way food shapes our lives the best image i know of this is from 650 years ago it 's ambrogio lorenzetti 's " allegory of good government " it 's about the relationship between the city and the countryside and i think the message of this is very clear if the city looks after the country the country will look after the city and i want us to ask now what would ambrogio lorenzetti paint if he painted this image today what would an allegory of good government look like today because i think it 's an urgent question it 's one we have to ask and we have to start answering we know we are what we eat we need to realize that the world is also what we eat but if we take that idea we can use food as a really powerful tool to shape the world better thank you very much the things we make have one supreme quality -- they live longer than us we perish they survive ; we have one life they have many lives and in each life they can mean different things which means that while we all have one biography they have many i want this morning to talk about the story the biography -- or rather the biographies -- of one particular object one remarkable thing it does n't i agree look very much it 's about the size of a rugby ball it 's made of clay and it 's been fashioned into a cylinder shape covered with close writing and then baked dry in the sun and as you can see it 's been knocked about a bit which is not surprising because it was made two and a half thousand years ago and was dug up in 1879 but today this thing is i believe a major player in the politics of the middle east and it 's an object with fascinating stories and stories that are by no means over yet the story begins in the iran-iraq war and that series of events that culminated in the invasion of iraq by foreign forces the removal of a despotic ruler and instant regime change and i want to begin with one episode from that sequence of events that most of you would be very familiar with belshazzar 's feast -- because we 're talking about the iran-iraq war of 539 bc and the parallels between the events of 539 bc and 2003 and in between are startling what you 're looking at is rembrandt 's painting now in the national gallery in london illustrating the text from the prophet daniel in the hebrew scriptures and you all know roughly the story belshazzar the son of nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar who 'd conquered israel sacked jerusalem and captured the people and taken the jews back to babylon not only the jews he 'd taken the temple vessels he 'd ransacked desecrated the temple and the great gold vessels of the temple in jerusalem had been taken to babylon belshazzar his son decides to have a feast and in order to make it even more exciting he added a bit of sacrilege to the rest of the fun and he brings out the temple vessels he 's already at war with the iranians with the king of persia and that night daniel tells us at the height of the festivities a hand appeared and wrote on the wall " you are weighed in the balance and found wanting and your kingdom is handed over to the medes and the persians " and that very night cyrus king of the persians entered babylon and the whole regime of belshazzar fell it is of course a great moment in the history of the jewish people it 's a great story it 's story we all know " the writing on the wall " is part of our everyday language what happened next was remarkable and it 's where our cylinder enters the story cyrus king of the persians has entered babylon without a fight -- the great empire of babylon which ran from central southern iraq to the mediterranean falls to cyrus and cyrus makes a declaration and that is what this cylinder is the declaration made by the ruler guided by god who had toppled the iraqi despot and was going to bring freedom to the people in ringing babylonian -- it was written in babylonian -- he says " i am cyrus king of all the universe the great king the powerful king king of babylon king of the four quarters of the world " they 're not shy of hyperbole as you can see this is probably the first real press release by a victorious army that we 've got and it 's written as we 'll see in due course by very skilled p.r consultants so the hyperbole is not actually surprising and what is the great king the powerful king the king of the four quarters of the world going to do he goes on to say that having conquered babylon he will at once let all the peoples that the babylonians -- nebuchadnezzar and belshazzar -- have captured and enslaved go free he 'll let them return to their countries and more important he will let them all recover the gods the statues the temple vessels that had been confiscated all the peoples that the babylonians had repressed and removed will go home and they 'll take with them their gods and they 'll be able to restore their altars and to worship their gods in their own way in their own place this is the decree this object is the evidence for the fact that the jews after the exile in babylon the years they 'd spent sitting by the waters of babylon weeping when they remembered jerusalem those jews were allowed to go home they were allowed to return to jerusalem and to rebuild the temple it 's a central document in jewish history and the book of chronicles the book of ezra in the hebrew scriptures reported in ringing terms this is the jewish version of the same story " thus said cyrus king of persia 'all the kingdoms of the earth have the lord god of heaven given thee and he has charged me to build him a house in jerusalem who is there among you of his people the lord god be with him and let him go up ' " " go up " -- aaleh the central element still of the notion of return a central part of the life of judaism as you all know that return from exile the second temple reshaped judaism and that change that great historic moment was made possible by cyrus the king of persia reported for us in hebrew in scripture and in babylonian in clay two great texts what about the politics what was going on was the fundamental shift in middle eastern history the empire of iran the medes and the persians united under cyrus became the first great world empire cyrus begins in the 530s bc and by the time of his son darius the whole of the eastern mediterranean is under persian control this empire is in fact the middle east as we now know it and it 's what shapes the middle east as we now know it it was the largest empire the world had known until then much more important it was the first multicultural multifaith state on a huge scale and it had to be run in a quite new way it had to be run in different languages the fact that this decree is in babylonian says one thing and it had to recognize their different habits different peoples different religions different faiths all of those are respected by cyrus cyrus sets up a model of how you run a great multinational multifaith multicultural society and the result of that was an empire that included the areas you see on the screen and which survived for 200 years of stability until it was shattered by alexander it left a dream of the middle east as a unit and a unit where people of different faiths could live together the greek invasions ended that and of course alexander could n't sustain a government and it fragmented but what cyrus represented remained absolutely central the greek historian xenophon wrote his book " cyropaedia " promoting cyrus as the great ruler and throughout european culture afterward cyrus remained the model this is a 16th century image to show you how widespread his veneration actually was and xenophon 's book on cyrus on how you ran a diverse society was one of the great textbooks that inspired the founding fathers of the american revolution jefferson was a great admirer -- the ideals of cyrus obviously speaking to those 18th century ideals of how you create religious tolerance in a new state meanwhile back in babylon things had not been going well after alexander the other empires babylon declines falls into ruins and all the traces of the great babylonian empire are lost -- until 1879 when the cylinder is discovered by a british museum exhibition digging in babylon and it enters now another story it enters that great debate in the middle of the 19th century : are the scriptures reliable can we trust them we only knew about the return of the jews and the decree of cyrus from the hebrew scriptures no other evidence suddenly this appeared and great excitement to a world where those who believed in the scriptures had had their faith in creation shaken by evolution by geology here was evidence that the scriptures were historically true it 's a great 19th century moment but -- and this of course is where it becomes complicated -- the facts were true hurrah for archeology but the interpretation was rather more complicated because the cylinder account and the hebrew bible account differ in one key respect the babylonian cylinder is written by the priests of the great god of bablyon marduk and not surprisingly they tell you that all this was done by marduk " marduk we hold called cyrus by his name " marduk takes cyrus by the hand calls him to shepherd his people and gives him the rule of babylon marduk tells cyrus that he will do these great generous things of setting the people free and this is why we should all be grateful to and worship marduk the hebrew writers in the old testament you will not be surprised to learn take a rather different view of this for them of course it ca n't possibly by marduk that made all this happen it can only be jehovah and so in isaiah we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this not to marduk but to the lord god of israel -- the lord god of israel who also called cyrus by name also takes cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people it 's a remarkable example of two different priestly appropriations of the same event two different religious takeovers of a political fact god we know is usually on the side of the big battalions the question is which god was it and the debate unsettles everybody in the 19th century to realize that the hebrew scriptures are part of a much wider world of religion and it 's quite clear the cylinder is older than the text of isaiah and yet jehovah is speaking in words very similar to those used by marduk and there 's a slight sense that isaiah knows this because he says this is god speaking of course " i have called thee by thy name though thou hast not known me " i think it 's recognized that cyrus does n't realize that he 's acting under orders from jehovah and equally he 'd have been surprised that he was acting under orders from marduk because interestingly of course cyrus is a good iranian with a totally different set of gods who are not mentioned in any of these texts that 's 1879 40 years on and we 're in 1917 and the cylinder enters a different world this time the real politics of the contemporary world -- the year of the balfour declaration the year when the new imperial power in the middle east britain decides that it will declare a jewish national home it will allow the jews to return and the response to this by the jewish population in eastern europe is rhapsodic and across eastern europe jews display pictures of cyrus and of george v side by side -- the two great rulers who have allowed the return to jerusalem and the cyrus cylinder comes back into public view and the text of this as a demonstration of why what is going to happen after the war is over in 1918 is part of a divine plan you all know what happened the state of israel is setup and 50 years later in the late 60s it 's clear that britain 's role as the imperial power is over and another story of the cylinder begins the region the u.k. and the u.s. decide has to be kept safe from communism and the superpower that will be created to do this would be iran the shah and so the shah invents an iranian history or a return to iranian history that puts him in the center of a great tradition and produces coins showing himself with the cyrus cylinder when he has his great celebrations in persepolis he summons the cylinder and the cylinder is lent by the british museum goes to tehran and is part of those great celebrations of the pahlavi dynasty cyrus cylinder : guarantor of the shah 10 years later another story : iranian revolution 1979 islamic revolution no more cyrus ; we 're not interested in that history we 're interested in islamic iran -- until iraq the new superpower that we 've all decided should be in the region then another iran-iraq war and it becomes critical for the iranians to remember their great past their great past when they fought iraq and won it becomes critical to find a symbol that will pull together all iranians -- muslims and non-muslims christians zoroastrians jews living in iran people who are devout not devout and the obvious emblem is cyrus so when the british museum and tehran national musuem cooperate and work together as we 've been doing the iranians ask for one thing only as a loan it 's the only object they want they want to borrow the cyrus cylinder and last year the cyrus cylinder went to tehran for the second time it 's shown being presented here put into its case by the director of the national museum of tehran one of the many women in iran in very senior positions mrs. ardakani it was a huge event this is the other side of that same picture it 's seen in tehran by between one and two million people in the space of a few months this is beyond any blockbuster exhibition in the west and it 's the subject of a huge debate about what this cylinder means what cyrus means but above all cyrus as articulated through this cylinder -- cyrus as the defender of the homeland the champion of course of iranian identity and of the iranian peoples tolerant of all faiths and in the current iran zoroastrians and christians have guaranteed places in the iranian parliament something to be very very proud of to see this object in tehran thousands of jews living in iran came to tehran to see it it became a great emblem a great subject of debate about what iran is at home and abroad is iran still to be the defender of the oppressed will iran set free the people that the tyrants have enslaved and expropriated this is heady national rhetoric and it was all put together in a great pageant launching the return here you see this out-sized cyrus cylinder on the stage with great figures from iranian history gathering to take their place in the heritage of iran it was a narrative presented by the president himself and for me to take this object to iran to be allowed to take this object to iran was to be allowed to be part of an extraordinary debate led at the highest levels about what iran is what different irans there are and how the different histories of iran might shape the world today it 's a debate that 's still continuing and it will continue to rumble because this object is one of the great declarations of a human aspiration it stands with the american constitution it certainly says far more about real freedoms than magna carta it is a document that can mean so many things for iran and for the region a replica of this is at the united nations in new york this autumn it will be present when the great debates about the future of the middle east take place and i want to finish by asking you what the next story will be in which this object figures it will appear certainly in many more middle eastern stories and what story of the middle east what story of the world do you want to see reflecting what is said what is expressed in this cylinder the right of peoples to live together in the same state worshiping differently freely -- a middle east a world in which religion is not the subject of division or of debate in the world of the middle east at the moment the debates are as you know shrill but i think it 's possible that the most powerful and the wisest voice of all of them may well be the voice of this mute thing the cyrus cylinder thank you i was basically concerned about what was going on in the world i could n't understand the starvation the destruction the killing of innocent people making sense of those things is a very difficult thing to do and when i was 12 i became an actor i was bottom of the class i have n't got any qualifications i was told i was dyslexic in fact i have got qualifications i got a d in pottery which was the one thing that i did get -- which was useful obviously and so concern is where all of this comes from and then being an actor i was doing these different kinds of things and i felt the content of the work that i was involved in really was n't cutting it that there surely had to be more and at that point i read a book by frank barnaby this wonderful nuclear physicist and he said that media had a responsibility that all sectors of society had a responsibility to try and progress things and move things forward and that fascinated me because i 'd been messing around with a camera most of my life and then i thought well maybe i could do something maybe i could become a filmmaker maybe i can use the form of film constructively to in some way make a difference maybe there 's a little change i can get involved in so i started thinking about peace and i was obviously as i said to you very much moved by these images trying to make sense of that could i go and speak to older and wiser people who would tell me how they made sense of the things that are going on because it 's obviously incredibly frightening but i realized that having been messing around with structure as an actor that a series of sound bites in itself was n't enough that there needed to be a mountain to climb there needed to be a journey that i had to take and if i took that journey no matter whether it failed or succeeded it would be completely irrelevant the point was that i would have something to hook the questions of -- is humankind fundamentally evil is the destruction of the world inevitable should i have children is that a responsible thing to do etc. etc so i was thinking about peace and then i was thinking well where 's the starting point for peace and that was when i had the idea there was no starting point for peace there was no day of global unity there was no day of intercultural cooperation there was no day when humanity came together separate in all of those things and just shared it together -- that we 're in this together and that if we united and we interculturally cooperated then that might be the key to humanity 's survival that might shift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues that humanity faces -- if we did it just for a day so obviously we did n't have any money i was living at my mom 's place and we started writing letters to everybody you very quickly work out what is it that you 've got to do to fathom that out how do you create a day voted by every single head of state in the world to create the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day the 21st of september and i wanted it to be the 21st of september because it was my granddad 's favorite number he was a prisoner of war he saw the bomb go off at nagasaki it poisoned his blood he died when i was 11 so he was like my hero and the reason why 21 was the number is 700 men left 23 came back two died on the boat and 21 hit the ground and that 's why we wanted it to be the 21st of september as the date of peace so we began this journey and we launched it in 1999 and we wrote to heads of state their ambassadors nobel peace laureates ngos faiths various organizations -- literally wrote to everybody and very quickly some letters started coming back and we started to build this case and i remember the first letter one of the first letters was from the dalai lama and of course we did n't have the money ; we were playing guitars and getting the money for the stamps that we were sending out all of [ this mail ] a letter came through from the dalai lama saying " this is an amazing thing come and see me i 'd love to talk to you about the first ever day of peace " and we did n't have money for the flight and i rang sir bob ayling who was ceo of ba at the time and said " mate we 've got this invitation could you give me a flight because we 're going to go see him " and of course we went and saw him and it was amazing and then dr. oscar arias came forward and actually let me go back to that slide because when we launched it in 1999 -- this idea to create the first ever day of ceasefire and non-violence -- we invited thousands of people well not thousands -- hundreds of people lots of people -- all the press because we were going to try and create the first ever world peace day a peace day and we invited everybody and no press showed up there were 114 people there -- they were mostly my friends and family and that was kind of like the launch of this thing but it did n't matter because we were documenting and that was the thing for me it was really about the process it was n't about the end result and that 's the beautiful thing about the camera they used to say the pen is mightier than the sword i think the camera is and just staying in the moment with it was a beautiful thing and really empowering actually so anyway we began the journey and here you see people like mary robinson i went to see in geneva i 'm cutting my hair it 's getting short and long because every time i saw kofi annan i was so worried that he thought i was a hippie that i cut it and that was kind of what was going on yeah i 'm not worried about it now so mary robinson she said to me " listen this is an idea whose time has come this must be created " kofi annan said " this will be beneficial to my troops on the ground " the oau at the time led by salim ahmed salim said " i must get the african countries involved " dr. oscar arias nobel peace laureate president now of costa rica said " i 'll do everything that i can " so i went and saw amr moussa at the league of arab states i met mandela at the arusha peace talks and so on and so on and so on -- while i was building the case to prove whether this idea would make sense and then we were listening to the people we were documenting everywhere 76 countries in the last 12 years i 've visited and i 've always spoken to women and children wherever i 've gone i 've recorded 44,000 young people i 've recorded about 900 hours of their thoughts i 'm really clear about how young people feel when you talk to them about this idea of having a starting point for their actions for a more peaceful world through their poetry their art their literature their music their sport whatever it might be and we were listening to everybody and it was an incredibly thing working with the u.n and working with ngos and building this case i felt that i was presenting a case on behalf of the global community to try and create this day and the stronger the case and the more detailed it was the better chance we had of creating this day and it was this stuff this where i actually was in the beginning kind of thinking no matter what happened it did n't actually matter it did n't matter if it did n't create a day of peace the fact is that if i tried and it did n't work then i could make a statement about how unwilling the global community is to unite -- until it was in somalia picking up that young girl and this young child who 'd taken about an inch and a half out of her leg with no antiseptic and that young boy who was a child soldier who told me he 'd killed people -- he was about 12 -- these things made me realize that this was not a film that i could just stop and that actually at that moment something happened to me which obviously made me go " i 'm going to document if this is the only film that i ever make i 'm going to document until this becomes a reality " because we 've got to stop we 've got to do something where we unite -- separate from all the politics and religion that as a young person is confusing me i do n't know how to get involved in that process and then on the seventh of september i was invited to new york the costa rican government and the british government had put forward to the united nations general assembly with 54 co-sponsors the idea of the first ever ceasefire nonviolence day the 21st of september as a fixed calendar date and it was unanimously adopted by every head of state in the world yeah but there were hundreds of individuals obviously who made that a reality and thank you to all of them that was an incredible moment i was at the top of the general assembly just looking down into it and seeing it happen and as i mentioned when it started we were at the globe and there was no press and now i was thinking " well the press it really going to hear this story " and suddenly we started to institutionalize this day kofi annan invited me on the morning of september the 11th to do a press conference and it was 8:00 am when i stood there and i was waiting for him to come down and i knew that he was on his way and obviously he never came down the statement was never made the world was never told there was a day of global ceasefire and nonviolence and it was obviously a tragic moment for the thousands of people who lost their lives there and then subsequently all over the world it never happened and i remember thinking " this is exactly why actually we have to work even harder and we have to make this day work it 's been created ; nobody knows but we have to continue this journey and we have to tell people and we have to prove it can work " and i left new york freaked but actually empowered and i felt inspired by the possibilities that if it did then maybe we would n't see things like that i remember putting that film out and going to cynics i was showing the film and i remember being in israel and getting it absolutely slaughtered by some guys having watched the film -- that it 's just a day of peace it does n't mean anything it 's not going to work ; you 're not going to stop the fighting in afghanistan ; the taliban wo n't listen etc. etc it 's just symbolism and that was even worse than actually what had just happened in many ways because it could n't not work i 'd spoken in somalia burundi gaza the west bank india sri lanka congo wherever it was and they 'd all tell me " if you can create a window of opportunity we can move aid we can vaccinate children children can lead their projects they can unite they can come together if people would stop lives will be saved " that 's what i 'd heard and i 'd heard that from the people who really understood what conflict was about and so i went back to the united nations i decided that i 'd continue filming and make another movie and i went back to the u.n. for another couple of years we started moving around the corridors of the u.n. system governments and ngos trying desperately to find somebody to come forward and have a go at it see if we could make it possible and after lots and lots of meetings obviously i 'm delighted that this man ahmad fawzi one of my heroes and mentors really he managed to get unicef involved and unicef god bless them they said " okay we 'll have a go " and then unama became involved in afghanistan it was historical could it work in afghanistan with unama and who and civil society etc. etc. etc and i was getting it all on film and i was recording it and i was thinking " this is it this is the possibility of it maybe working but even if it does n't at least the door is open and there 's a chance " and so i went back to london and i went and saw this chap jude law and i saw him because he was an actor i was an actor i had a connection to him because we needed to get to the press we needed this attraction we needed the media to be involved because if we start pumping it up a bit maybe more people would listen and there 'd be more -- when we got into certain areas maybe there would be more people interested and maybe we 'd be helped financially a little bit more which had been desperately difficult i wo n't go into that so jude said " okay i 'll do some statements for you " while i was filming these statements he said to me " where are you going next " i said " i 'm going to go to afghanistan " he said " really " and i could sort of see a little look in his eye of interest so i said to him " do you want to come with me it 'd be really interesting if you came it would help and bring attention and that attention would help leverage the situation as well as all of the other sides of it " i think there 's a number of pillars to success one is you 've got to have a great idea the other is you 've got to have a constituency you 've got to have finance and you 've got to be able to raise awareness and actually i could never raise awareness by myself no matter what i 'd achieved so these guys were absolutely crucial so he said yes and we found ourselves in afghanistan it was a really incredible thing that when we landed there i was talking to various people and they were saying to me " you 've got to get everybody involved here you ca n't just expect it to work you have to get out and work " and we did and we traveled around and we spoke to elders we spoke to doctors we spoke to nurses we held press conferences we went out with soldiers we sat down with isaf we sat down with nato we sat down with the u.k. government i mean we basically sat down with everybody -- in and out of schools with ministers of education holding these press conferences which of course now were loaded with press everybody was there there was an interest in what was going on this amazing woman fatima gailani was absolutely instrumental in what went on as she was the spokesperson for the resistance against the russians and her afghan network was just absolutely everywhere and she was really crucial in getting the message in and then we went home we 'd sort of done it we had to wait now and see what happened and i got home and i remember one of the team bringing in a letter to me from the taliban and that letter basically said " we 'll observe this day we will observe this day we see it as a window of opportunity and we will not engage we 're not going to engage " and that meant that humanitarian workers would n't be kidnapped or killed and then suddenly i obviously knew at this point there was a chance and days later 1.6 million children were vaccinated against polio as a consequence of everybody stopping and like the general assembly obviously the most wonderful wonderful moment and so then we wrapped the film up and we put it together because we had to go back we put it into dari and pashto we put it in the local dialects we went back to afghanistan because the next year was coming and we wanted to support but more importantly we wanted to go back because these people in afghanistan were the heroes they were the people who believed in peace and the possibilities of it etc. etc -- and they made it real and we wanted to go back and show them the film and say " look you guys made this possible and thank you very much " and we gave the film over obviously it was shown and it was amazing and then that year that year 2008 this isaf statement from kabul afghanistan september 17th : " general stanley mcchrystal commander of international security assistance forces in afghanistan announced today isaf will not conduct offensive military operations on the 21st of september " they were saying they would stop and then there was this other statement that came out from the u.n. department of security and safety saying that in afghanistan because of this work the violence was down by 70 percent 70 percent reduction in violence on this day at least and that completely blew my mind almost more than anything and i remember being stuck in new york this time because of the volcano which was obviously much less harmful and i was there thinking about what was going on and i kept thinking about this 70 percent 70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you could n't do and that made me think that if we can get 70 percent in afghanistan then surely we can get 70 percent reduction everywhere we have to go for a global truce we have to utilize this day of ceasefire and nonviolence and go for a global truce go for the largest recorded cessation of hostilities both domestically and internationally ever recorded that 's exactly what we must do and on the 21st of september this year we 're going to launch that campaign at the o2 arena to go for that process to try and create the largest recorded cessation of hostilities and we will utilize all kinds of things -- have a dance and social media and visiting on facebook and visit the website sign the petition and it 's in the six official languages of the united nations and we 'll globally link with government inter-government non-government education unions sports and you can see the education box there we 've got resources at the moment in 174 countries trying to get young people to be the driving force behind the vision of that global truce and obviously the life-saving is increased the concepts help linking up with the olympics -- i went and saw seb coe i said " london 2012 is about truce ultimately that 's what it 's about " why do n't we all team up why do n't we bring truce to life why do n't you support the process of the largest ever global truce we 'll make a new film about this process we 'll utilize sport and football on the day of peace there 's thousands of football matches all played from the favelas of brazil to wherever it might be so utilizing all of these ways to inspire individual action and ultimately we have to try that we have to work together and when i stand here in front of all of you and the people who will watch these things i 'm excited on behalf of everybody i 've met that there is a possibility that our world could unite that we could come together as one that we could lift the level of consciousness around the fundamental issues brought about by individuals i was with brahimi ambassador brahimi i think he 's one of the most incredible men in relation to international politics -- in afghanistan in iraq he 's an amazing man and i sat with him a few weeks ago and i said to him " mr. brahimi is this nuts going for a global truce is this possible is it really possible that we could do this " he said " it 's absolutely possible " i said " what would you do would you go to governments and lobby and use the system " he said " no i 'd talk to the individuals " it 's all about the individuals it 's all about you and me it 's all about partnerships it 's about your constituencies ; it 's about your businesses because together by working together i seriously think we can start to change things and there 's a wonderful man sitting in this audience and i do n't know where he is who said to me a few days ago -- because i did a little rehearsal -- and he said " i 've been thinking about this day and imagining it as a square with 365 squares and one of them is white " and it then made me think about a glass of water which is clear if you put one drop one drop of something in that water it 'll change it forever by working together we can create peace one day thank you ted thank you thank you thanks a lot thank you very much thank you i draw to better understand things sometimes i make a lot of drawings and i still do n't understand what it is i 'm drawing those of you who are comfortable with digital stuff and even smug about that relationship might be amused to know that the guy who is best known for " the way things work " while preparing for part of a panel for called understanding spent two days trying to get his laptop to communicate with his new cd burner who knew about extension managers i 've always managed my own extensions so it never even occurred to me to read the instructions but i did finally figure it out i had to figure it out because along with the invitation came the frightening reminder that there would be no projector so bringing those carousels would no longer be necessary but some alternate form of communication would now i could talk about something that i 'm known for something that would be particularly appropriate for many of the more technically minded people here or i could talk about something i really care about i decided to go with the latter i 'm going to talk about rome now why would i care about rome particularly well i went to rhode island school of design in the second half of the '60s to study architecture i was lucky enough to spend my last year my fifth year in rome as a student it changed my life not the least reason was the fact that i had spent those first four years living at home driving into risd everyday driving back i missed the '60s i read about them ; i understand they were pretty interesting i missed them but i did spend that extraordinary year in rome and it 's a place that is never far from my mind so whenever given an opportunity i try to do something in it or with it or for it i also make drawings to help people understand things things that i want them to believe i understand and that 's what i do as an illustrator that 's my job so i 'm going to show you some pictures of rome i 've made a lot of drawings of rome over the years these are just drawings of rome i get back as often as possible -- i need to all different materials all different styles all different times drawings from sketchbooks looking at the details of rome part of the reason i 'm showing you these is that it sort of helps illustrate this process i go through of trying to figure out what it is i feel about rome and why i feel it these are sketches of some of the little details rome is a city full of surprises i mean we 're talking about unusual perspectives we 're talking about narrow little winding streets that suddenly open into vast sun-drenched piazzas -- never though piazzas that are not humanly scaled part of the reason for that is the fact that they grew up organically that amazing juxtaposition of old and new the bits of light that come down between the buildings that sort of create a map that 's traveling above your head of usually blue -- especially in the summer -- compared to the map that you would normally expect to see of conventional streets and i began to think about how i could communicate this in book form how could i share my sense of rome my understanding of rome and i 'm going to show you a bunch of dead ends basically the primary reason for all these dead ends is when if you 're not quite sure where you 're going you 're certainly not going to get there with any kind of efficiency here 's a little map and i thought of maps at the beginning ; maybe i should just try and do a little atlas of my favorite streets and connections in rome and here 's a line of text that actually evolves from the exhaust of a scooter zipping across the page here that same line of text wraps around a fountain in an illustration that can be turned upside down and read both ways maybe that line of text could be a story to help give some human aspect to this maybe i should get away from this map completely and really be honest about wanting to show you my favorite bits and pieces of rome and simply kick a soccer ball in the air -- which happens in so many of the squares in the city -- and let it bounce off of things and i 'll simply explain what each of those things is that the soccer ball hits that seemed like a sort of a cheap shot but even though i just started this presentation this is not the first thing that i tried to do and i was getting sort of desperate eventually i realized that i had really no content that i could count on so i decided to move towards packaging i mean it seems to work for a lot of things so i thought a little box set of four small books might do the trick but one of the ideas that emerged from some of those sketches was the notion of traveling through rome in different vehicles at different speeds in order to show the different aspects of rome sort of an overview of rome and the plan that you might see from a dirigible quick snapshots of things you might see from a speeding motor scooter and very slow walking through rome you might be able to study in more detail some of the wonderful surfaces and whatnot that you come across anyways i went back to the dirigible notion went to alberto santos-dumont found one of his dirigibles that had enough dimensions so i could actually use it as a scale that i would then juxtapose with some of the things in rome this thing would be flying over or past or be parked in front of but it would be like having a ruler -- sort of travel through the pages without being a ruler not that you know how long number 11 actually is but you would be able to compare number 11 against the pantheon with number 11 against the baths of caracalla and so on and so forth if you were interested this is beatrix she has a dog named ajax she has purchased a dirigible -- a small dirigible -- she 's assembling the structure ajax is sniffing for holes in the balloon before they set off she launches this thing above the spanish steps and sets off for an aerial tour of the city over the spanish steps we go a nice way to show that river that stream sort of pouring down the hill unfortunately just across the road from it or quite close by is the column of marcus aurelius and the diameter of the dirigible makes an impression as you can see as she starts trying to read the story that spirals around the column of marcus aurelius -- gets a little too close nudges it this gives me a chance to suggest to you the structure of the column of marcus aurelius which is really no more than a pile of quarters high -- thick quarters over the piazza of saint ignacio completely ruining the symmetry but that aside a spectacular place to visit a spectacular framework inside of which you see usually extraordinary blue sky over the pantheon and the 26-foot diameter oculus she parks her dirigible lowers the anchor rope and climbs down for a closer look inside the text here is right side and upside down so that you are forced to turn the book around and you can see it from ground point of view and from her point of view -- looking in the hole getting a different kind of perspective moving you around the space particularly appropriate in a building that can contain perfectly a sphere dimensions of the diameter being the same as the distance from the center of the floor to the center of the oculus unfortunately for her the anchor line gets tangled around the feet of some boy scouts who are visiting the pantheon and they are immediately yanked out and given an extraordinary but terrifying tour of some of the domes of rome which would from their point of view naturally be hanging upside down they bail out as soon as they get to the top of saint ivo that little spiral structure you see there she continues on her way over piazza navona notices a lot of activity at the tre scalini restaurant is reminded that it is lunchtime and she 's hungry they keep on motoring towards the campo de ' fiori which they soon reach ajax the dog is put in a basket and lowered with a list of food into the marketplace which flourishes there until about one in the afternoon and then is completely removed and does n't appear again until six or seven the following morning anyway the pooch gets back to the dirigible with the stuff unfortunately when she goes to unwrap the prosciutto ajax makes a lunge for it she 's managed to save the prosciutto but in the process she loses the tablecloth which you can see flying away in the upper left-hand corner they continue without their tablecloth looking for a place to land this thing so that they can actually have lunch they eventually discover a huge wall that 's filled with small holes ideal for docking a dirigible because you 've got a place to tie up turns out to be the exterior wall -- that part of it that remains -- of the coliseum so they park themselves there and have a terrific lunch and have a spectacular view at the end of lunch they untie the anchor they set off through the baths of caracalla and over the walls of the city and then an abandoned gatehouse and decide to take one more look at the pyramid of cestius which has this lightning rod on top unfortunately that 's a problem : they get a little too close and when you 're in a dirigible you have to be very careful about spikes so that sort of brings her little story to a conclusion marcello on the other hand is sort of a lazy guy but he 's not due at work until about noon so the alarm goes off and it 's five to 12 or so he gets up leaps onto his scooter races through the city past the church of santa maria della pace down the alleys through the streets that tourists may be wandering through disturbing the quiet backstreet life of rome at every turn that speed with which he is moving i hope i have suggested in this little image which again can be turned around and read from both sides because there 's text on the bottom and text on the top one of which is upside down in this image so he keeps on moving approaching an unsuspecting waiter who is trying to deliver two plates of linguine in a delicate white wine clam sauce to diners who are sitting at a table just outside of a restaurant in the street waiter catches on but it 's too late and marcello keeps moving in his scooter everything he sees from this point on is slightly affected by the linguine but keeps on moving because this guy 's got a job to do removes some scaffolding one of the reasons rome remains the extraordinary place it is that because of scaffolding and the determination to maintain the fabric it is a city that continues to grow and adapt to the needs of the particular time in which it finds itself or we find it right through the piazza della rotonda in front of the pantheon -- again wreaking havoc -- and finally getting to work marcello as it turns out is the driver of the number 64 bus and if you 've been on the number 64 bus you know that it 's driven with the same kind of exuberance as marcello demonstrated on his scooter and finally carletto you see his apartment in the upper left-hand corner he 's looking at his table ; he 's planning to propose this evening to his girlfriend of 40 years and he wants it to be perfect he 's got candles out he 's got flowers in the middle and he 's trying to figure out where to put the plates and the glasses but he 's not happy ; something 's wrong the phone rings anyway he 's called to the palazzo he saunters -- he saunters at a good clip but as compared to all the traveling we 've just seen he 's sauntering everybody knows carletto because he 's in entertainment actually ; he 's in television he 's actually in television repair which is why people know him so they all have his number he arrives at the palazzo arrives at the big front door enters the courtyard and talks to the custodian who tells him that there 's been a disaster in the palazzo ; nobody 's tvs are working and there 's a big soccer game coming up and the crowd is getting a little restless and a little nervous he goes down to the basement and starts to check the wiring and then gradually works his way up to the top of the building apartment by apartment checking every television checking every connection hoping to find out what this problem is he works his way up finally the grand staircase and then a smaller staircase until he reaches the attic he opens the window of the attic of course and there 's a tablecloth wrapped around the building 's television antenna he removes it the problems are solved everybody in the palazzo is happy and of course he also solves his own problem all he has to do now with a perfect table is wait for her to arrive that was the first attempt but it did n't seem substantial enough to convey whatever it was i wanted to convey about rome so i thought well i 'll just do piazzas and i 'll get inside and underneath and i 'll show these things growing and show why they 're shaped the way they are and so on and then i thought that 's too complicated no i 'll just take my favorite bits and pieces and i 'll put them inside the pantheon but keep the scale so you can see the top of sant'ivo and the pyramid of cestius and the tempietto of bramante all side by side in this amazing space now that 's one drawing so i thought maybe it 's time for piranesi to meet escher you see that i 'm beginning to really lose control here and also hope there 's a very thin blue line of exhaust that sort of runs through this thing that would be kind of the trail that holds it all together then i thought " wait a minute what am i doing " a book is not only a neat way of collecting and storing information it 's a series of layers i mean you always peel one layer off another ; we think of them as pages doing it a certain way but think of them as layers i mean rome is a place of layers -- horizontal layers vertical layers -- and i thought well just peeling off a page would allow me to -- if i got you thinking about it the right way -- would allow me to sort of show you the depth of layers the stucco on the walls of most of the buildings in rome covers the scars ; the scars of centuries of change as these structures have been adapted rather than being torn down if i do a foldout page on the left-hand side and let you just unfold it you see behind it what i mean by scar tissue you can see that in 1635 it became essential to make smaller windows because the bad guys were coming or whatever adaptations all get buried under the stucco i could peel out a page of this palazzo to show you what 's going on inside of it but more importantly i could also show you what it looks like at the corner of one of those magnificent buildings with all the massive stone blocks or the fake stone blocks done with brick and stucco which is more often the case so it becomes slightly three-dimensional i could take you down one of those narrow little streets into one of those surprising piazzas by using a double gate fold -- double foldout page -- which if you were like me reading a pop-up book as a child you hopefully stick your head into you wrap the pages around your head and are in that piazza for that brief period of time and i 've really not done anything much more complicated than make foldout pages but then i thought maybe i could be simpler here let 's look at the pantheon and the piazza della rotonda in front of it here 's a book completely wide open ok if i do n't open the book the whole way if i just open it 90 degrees we 're looking down the front of the pantheon and we 're looking sort of at the top more or less down on the square and if i turn the book the other way we 're looking across the square at the front of the pantheon no foldouts no tricks -- just a book that is n't open the whole way that seemed promising i thought maybe i 'll do it inside and i can even combine the foldouts with the only partially opened book so we get inside the pantheon and it grows and so on and so forth and i thought maybe i 'm on the right track but it sort of lost its human quality so i went back to the notion of story which is always a good thing to have if you 're trying to get people to pay attention to a book and pick up information along the way " pigeon 's progress " struck me as a catchy title if it was a homing pigeon it would be called " homer 's odyssey " but it was the journey of the â€¦ i mean if a title works use it but it would be a journey that went through rome and showed all the things that i like about rome it 's a pigeon sitting on top of a church goes off during the day and does normal pigeon stuff comes back the whole place is covered with scaffolding and green netting and there 's no way this pigeon can get home so it 's a homeless pigeon now and it 's going to have to find another place to live and that allows me to go through my catalog of favorite things and we start with the tall ones and so on maybe it has to go back and live with family members ; that 's not always a good thing but it does sort of bring pigeons together again and i thought that 's sort of interesting but maybe there 's a person who should be involved in this in some way so i kind of came up with this old guy who spends his life looking after sick pigeons he 'll go anywhere to get them -- dangerous places and whatnot -- and they become really friends with this guy and learn to do tricks for him and entertain him at lunchtime and stuff like that there 's a real bond that develops between this old man and these pigeons but unfortunately he gets sick he gets really sick at the end of the story he 's taught them to spell his name which is aldo they show up one day after three or four days of not seeing him -- he lives in this little garret -- and they spell his name and fly around and he finally gets enough strength together to climb up the ladder onto the roof and all the pigeons a la red balloon are there waiting for him and they carry him off over the walls of the city and i forgot to mention this : whenever he lost a pigeon he would take that pigeon out beyond the walls of the city in the old roman custom the dead were never buried within the walls and i thought that 's a really cheery story that 's really going to go a long way so anyway i went through â€¦ and again if packaging does n't work and if the stories are n't going anywhere i just come up with titles and hope that a title will sort of kick me off in the right direction and sometimes it does focus me enough and i 'll even do a title page so these are all title pages that eventually led me to the solution i settled on which is the story of a young woman who sends a message on a homing pigeon -- she lives outside the walls of the city of rome -- to someone in the city and the pigeon is flying down above the appian way here you can see the tombs and pines and so on and so forth along the way if you see the red line you are seeing the trail of the pigeon ; if you do n't see the red line you are the pigeon and it becomes necessary and possible at this point to try to convey what that sense would be like of flying over the city without actually moving past the pyramid of cestius -- these will seem very familiar to you even if you have n't been to rome recently -- past the gatehouse this is something that 's a little bit unusual this pigeon does something that most homing pigeons do not do : it takes the scenic route which was a device that i felt was necessary to actually extend this book beyond about four pages so we circle around the coliseum past the church of santa maria in cosmedin and the temple of hercules towards the river we almost collide with the cornice of the palazzo farnese -- designed by michelangelo built of stone taken from the coliseum -- narrow escape we swoop down over the campo de ' fiori this is one of those things i show to my students because it 's a complete bastardization -- a denial of any rules of perspective the only rule of perspective that i think matters is if it looks believable you 've succeeded but you try and figure out where the vanishing points meet here ; a couple are on mars and a couple of others in cremona but into the piazza in front of santa maria della pace where invariably a soccer game is going on and we 're hit by a soccer ball now this is a terrible illustration of being hit by a soccer ball i have all the pieces : there 's santa maria della pace there 's a soccer ball there 's a little bit of a bird 's wing -- nothing 's happening so i had to rethink it and if you do want to see santa maria della pace these books are really flexible incredibly interactive -- just turn it around and look at it the other way through the alley we can see the impact is captured in the red line and then bird manages to pull itself together past this medieval tower -- one of the few remaining medieval towers -- towards the church of sant'agnese and around the dome looking down into piazza navona -- which we 've already mentioned and seen and flown over a couple of times ; there 's the bernini statue of the four rivers -- and then past the wonderful borromini sant'ivo stopping just long enough on the 26-foot diameter oculus of the pantheon to catch our breath and then we can swoop inside and around ; and because we 're flying we do n't really have to worry about gravity at this particular moment in time so this drawing can be oriented in any way on the page we get a little exuberant as we pass gesu ; it 's not surprising to sort of mimic the architecture in this way past the wonderful wall filled with the juxtaposition that i was talking about ; beautiful carvings set into the walls above the neon " ristorante " sign and so on and eventually we arrive at the courtyard of the palazzo which is our destination straight up through the courtyard into a little window into the attic where somebody is working at the drawing board he removes the message from the leg of the bird ; this is what it says as we look at the drawing board we see what he 's working on is in fact a map of the journey that the pigeon has just taken and the red line extends through all the sights and if you want the information so that we complete this cycle of understanding all you have to do is read these paragraphs thank you very much today i 'd like to show you the future of the way we make things i believe that soon our buildings and machines will be self-assembling replicating and repairing themselves so i 'm going to show you what i believe is the current state of manufacturing and then compare that to some natural systems so in the current state of manufacturing we have skyscrapers -- two and a half years [ of assembly time ] 500,000 to a million parts fairly complex new exciting technologies in steel concrete glass we have exciting machines that can take us into space -- five years [ of assembly time ] 2.5 million parts but on the other side if you look at the natural systems we have proteins that have two million types can fold in 10,000 nanoseconds or dna with three billion base pairs we can replicate in roughly an hour so there 's all of this complexity in our natural systems but they 're extremely efficient far more efficient than anything we can build far more complex than anything we can build they 're far more efficient in terms of energy they hardly ever make mistakes and they can repair themselves for longevity so there 's something super interesting about natural systems and if we can translate that into our built environment then there 's some exciting potential for the way that we build things and i think the key to that is self-assembly so if we want to utilize self-assembly in our physical environment i think there 's four key factors the first is that we need to decode all of the complexity of what we want to build -- so our buildings and machines and we need to decode that into simple sequences -- basically the dna of how our buildings work then we need programmable parts that can take that sequence and use that to fold up or reconfigure we need some energy that 's going to allow that to activate allow our parts to be able to fold up from the program and we need some type of error correction redundancy to guarantee that we have successfully built what we want so i 'm going to show you a number of projects that my colleagues and i at mit are working on to achieve this self-assembling future the first two are the macrobot and decibot so these projects are large-scale reconfigurable robots -- 8 ft. 12 ft. long proteins they 're embedded with mechanical electrical devices sensors you decode what you want to fold up into into a sequence of angles -- so negative 120 negative 120 0 0 120 negative 120 -- something like that ; so a sequence of angles or turns and you send that sequence through the string each unit takes its message -- so negative 120 -- it rotates to that checks if it got there and then passes it to its neighbor so these are the brilliant scientists engineers designers that worked on this project and i think it really brings to light : is this really scalable i mean thousands of dollars lots of man hours made to make this eight-foot robot can we really scale this up can we really embed robotics into every part the next one questions that and looks at passive nature or passively trying to have reconfiguration programmability but it goes a step further and it tries to have actual computation it basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing the digital logic gate directly into your parts so this is a nand gate you have one tetrahedron which is the gate that 's going to do your computing and you have two input tetrahedrons one of them is the input from the user as you 're building your bricks the other one is from the previous brick that was placed and then it gives you an output in 3d space so what this means is that the user can start plugging in what they want the bricks to do it computes on what it was doing before and what you said you wanted it to do and now it starts moving in three-dimensional space -- so up or down so on the left-hand side [ 1,1 ] input equals 0 output which goes down on the right-hand side [ 0,0 ] input is a 1 output which goes up and so what that really means is that our structures now contain the blueprints of what we want to build so they have all of the information embedded in them of what was constructed so that means that we can have some form of self-replication in this case i call it self-guided replication because your structure contains the exact blueprints if you have errors you can replace a part all the local information is embedded to tell you how to fix it so you could have something that climbs along and reads it and can output at one to one it 's directly embedded ; there 's no external instructions so the last project i 'll show is called biased chains and it 's probably the most exciting example that we have right now of passive self-assembly systems so it takes the reconfigurability and programmability and makes it a completely passive system so basically you have a chain of elements each element is completely identical and they 're biased so each chain or each element wants to turn right or left so as you assemble the chain you 're basically programming it you 're telling each unit if it should turn right or left so when you shake the chain it then folds up into any configuration that you 've programmed in -- so in this case a spiral or in this case two cubes next to each other so you can basically program any three-dimensional shape -- or one-dimensional two-dimensional -- up into this chain completely passively so what does this tell us about the future i think that it 's telling us that there 's new possibilities for self-assembly replication repair in our physical structures our buildings machines there 's new programmability in these parts and from that you have new possibilities for computing we 'll have spatial computing imagine if our buildings our bridges machines all of our bricks could actually compute that 's amazing parallel and distributed computing power new design possibilities so it 's exciting potential for this so i think these projects i 've showed here are just a tiny step towards this future if we implement these new technologies for a new self-assembling world thank you we 've been told to go out on a limb and say something surprising so i 'll try and do that but i want to start with two things that everyone already knows and the first one in fact is something that has been known for most of recorded history and that is that the planet earth or the solar system or our environment or whatever is uniquely suited to sustain our evolution -- or creation as it used to be thought -- and our present existence and most important our future survival nowadays this idea has a dramatic name : spaceship earth and the idea there is that outside the spaceship the universe is implacably hostile and inside is all we have all we depend on and we only get the one chance : if we mess up our spaceship we 've got nowhere else to go now the second thing that everyone already knows is that contrary to what was believed for most of human history human beings are not in fact the hub of existence as stephen hawking famously said we 're just a chemical scum on the surface of a typical planet that 's in orbit around a typical star which is on the outskirts of a typical galaxy and so on now the first of those two things that everyone knows is kind of saying that we 're at a very un-typical place uniquely suited and so on and the second one is saying that we 're at a typical place and especially if you regard these two as deep truths to live by and to inform your life decisions then they seem a little bit to conflict with each other but that does n't prevent them from both being completely false and they are so let me start with the second one : typical well -- is this a typical place well let 's look around you know and look in a random direction and we see a wall and chemical scum -- -- and that 's not typical of the universe at all all you 've got to do is go a few hundred miles in that same direction and look back and you wo n't see any walls or chemical scum at all -- all you see is a blue planet and if you go further than that you 'll see the sun the solar system and the stars and so on but that 's still not typical of the universe because stars come in galaxies and most places in the universe a typical place in the universe is nowhere near any galaxies so let 's go out further till we 're outside the galaxy and look back and yeah there 's the huge galaxy with spiral arms laid out in front of us and at this point we 've come 100,000 light years from here but we 're still nowhere near a typical place in the universe to get to a typical place you 've got to go 1,000 times as far as that into intergalactic space and so what does that look like typical what does a typical place in the universe look like well at enormous expense ted has arranged a high-resolution immersion virtual reality rendering of intergalactic space -- the view from intergalactic space so can we have the lights off please so we can see it well not quite not quite perfect -- you see in intergalactic space -- intergalactic space is completely dark pitch dark it 's so dark that if you were to be looking at the nearest star to you and that star were to explode as a supernova and you were to be staring directly at it at the moment when its light reached you you still would n't be able to see even a glimmer that 's how big and how dark the universe is and that 's despite the fact that a supernova is so bright so brilliant an event that it would kill you stone dead at a range of several light years and yet from intergalactic space it 's so far away you would n't even see it it 's also very cold out there -- less than three degrees above absolute zero and it 's very empty the vacuum there is one million times less dense than the highest vacuum that our best technology on earth can currently create so that 's how different a typical place is from this place and that is how un-typical this place is so can we have the lights back on please thank you now how do we know about an environment that 's so far away and so different and so alien from anything we 're used to well the earth -- our environment in the form of us -- is creating knowledge well what does that mean well look out even further than we 've just been -- i mean from here with a telescope -- and you 'll see things that look like stars they 're called " quasars " quasars originally meant quasi-stellar object which means things that look a bit like stars but they 're not stars and we know what they are billions of years ago and billions of light years away the material at the center of a galaxy collapsed towards a super-massive black hole and then intense magnetic fields directed some of the energy of that gravitational collapse and some of the matter back out in the form of tremendous jets which illuminated lobes with the brilliance of -- i think it 's a trillion suns now the physics of the human brain could hardly be more unlike the physics of such a jet we could n't survive for an instant in it language breaks down when trying to describe what it would be like in one of those jets it would be a bit like experiencing a supernova explosion but at point-blank range and for millions of years at a time and yet that jet happened in precisely such a way that billions of years later on the other side of the universe some bit of chemical scum could accurately describe and model and predict and explain above all -- there 's your reference -- what was happening there in reality the one physical system the brain contains an accurate working model of the other -- the quasar not just a superficial image of it though it contains that as well but an explanatory model embodying the same mathematical relationships and the same causal structure now that is knowledge and if that were n't amazing enough the faithfulness with which the one structure resembles the other is increasing with time that is the growth of knowledge so the laws of physics have this special property that physical objects as unlike each other as they could possibly be can nevertheless embody the same mathematical and causal structure and to do it more and more so over time so we are a chemical scum that is different this chemical scum has universality its structure contains with ever-increasing precision the structure of everything this place and not other places in the universe is a hub which contains within itself the structural and causal essence of the whole of the rest of physical reality and so far from being insignificant the fact that the laws of physics allow this or even mandate that this can happen is one of the most important things about the physical world now how does the solar system -- and our environment in the form of us -- acquire this special relationship with the rest of the universe well one thing that 's true about stephen hawking 's remark -- i mean it is true but it 's the wrong emphasis one thing that 's true about it is that it does n't do it with any special physics there 's no special dispensation no miracles involved it does it simply with three things that we have here in abundance one of them is matter because the growth of knowledge is a form of information processing information processing is computation computation requires a computer -- there 's no known way of making a computer without matter we also need energy to make the computer and most important to make the media in effect onto which we record the knowledge that we discover and then thirdly less tangible but just as essential for the open-ended creation of knowledge of explanations is evidence now our environment is inundated with evidence we happen to get round to testing let 's say newton 's law of gravity about 300 years ago but the evidence that we used to do that was falling down on every square meter of the earth for billions of years before that and will continue to fall on for billions of years afterwards and the same is true for all the other sciences as far as we know evidence to discover the most fundamental truths of all the sciences is here just for the taking on our planet our location is saturated with evidence and also with matter and energy out in intergalactic space those three prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge are at their lowest possible supply as i said it 's empty ; it 's cold ; and it 's dark out there or is it now actually that 's just another parochial misconception because imagine a cube out there in intergalactic space the same size as our home the solar system now that cube is very empty by human standards but that still means that it contains over a million tons of matter and a million tons is enough to make say a self-contained space station on which there 's a colony of scientists that are devoted to creating an open-ended stream of knowledge and so on now it 's way beyond present technology to even gather the hydrogen from intergalactic space and form it into other elements and so on but the thing is in a comprehensible universe if something is n't forbidden by the laws of physics then what could possibly prevent us from doing it other than knowing how in other words it 's a matter of knowledge not resources and the same -- well if we could do that we 'd automatically have an energy supply because the transmutation would be a fusion reactor -- and evidence well again it 's dark out there to human senses but all you 've got to do is take a telescope even one of present-day design look out and you 'll see the same galaxies as we do from here and with a more powerful telescope you 'll be able to see stars and planets in those galaxies you 'll be able to do astrophysics and learn the laws of physics and locally there you could build particle accelerators and learn elementary particle physics and chemistry and so on probably the hardest science to do would be biology field trips -- -- because it would take several hundred million years to get to the nearest life-bearing planet and back but i have to tell you -- and sorry richard -- but i never did like biology field trips much and i think we can just about make do with one every few hundred million years so in fact intergalactic space does contain all the prerequisites for the open-ended creation of knowledge any such cube anywhere in the universe could become the same kind of hub that we are if the knowledge of how to do so were present there so we 're not in a uniquely hospitable place if intergalactic space is capable of creating an open-ended stream of explanations then so is almost every other environment so is the earth so is a polluted earth and the limiting factor there and here is not resources because they 're plentiful but knowledge which is scarce now this cosmic knowledge-based view may -- and i think ought to -- make us feel very special but it should also make us feel vulnerable because it means that without the specific knowledge that 's needed to survive the ongoing challenges of the universe we wo n't survive them all it takes is for a supernova to go off a few light years away and we 'll all be dead ! martin rees has recently written a book about our vulnerability to all sorts of things from astrophysics to scientific experiments gone wrong and most importantly to terrorism with weapons of mass destruction and he thinks that civilization has only a 50 percent chance of surviving this century i think he 's going to talk about that later in the conference now i do n't think that probability is the right category to discuss this issue in but i do agree with him about this we can survive and we can fail to survive but it depends not on chance but on whether we create the relevant knowledge in time the danger is not at all unprecedented species go extinct all the time civilizations end the overwhelming majority of all species and all civilizations that have ever existed are now history and if we want to be the exception to that then logically our only hope is to make use of the one feature that distinguishes our species and our civilization from all the others -- namely our special relationship with the laws of physics our ability to create new explanations new knowledge -- to be a hub of existence so let me now apply this to a current controversy not because i want to advocate any particular solution but just to illustrate the kind of thing i mean and the controversy is global warming now i 'm a physicist but i 'm not the right kind of physicist in regard to global warming i 'm just a layman and the rational thing for a layman to do is to take seriously the prevailing scientific theory and according to that theory it 's already too late to avoid a disaster because if it 's true that our best option at the moment is to prevent co2 emissions with something like the kyoto protocol with its constraints on economic activity and its enormous cost of hundreds of billions of dollars or whatever it is then that is already a disaster by any reasonable measure and the actions that are advocated are not even purported to solve the problem merely to postpone it by a little so it 's already too late to avoid it and it probably has been too late to avoid it ever since before anyone realized the danger it was probably already too late in the 1970s when the best available scientific theory was telling us that industrial emissions were about to precipitate a new ice age in which billions would die now the lesson of that seems clear to me and i do n't know why it is n't informing public debate it is that we ca n't always know when we know of an impending disaster and how to solve it at a cost less than the cost of the disaster itself then there 's not going to be much argument really but no precautions and no precautionary principle can avoid problems that we do not yet foresee hence we need a stance of problem-fixing not just problem-avoidance and it 's true that an ounce of prevention equals a pound of cure but that 's only if we know what to prevent if you 've been punched on the nose then the science of medicine does not consist of teaching you how to avoid punches if medical science stopped seeking cures and concentrated on prevention only then it would achieve very little of either the world is buzzing at the moment with plans to force reductions in gas emissions at all costs it ought to be buzzing with plans to reduce the temperature and with plans to live at the higher temperature -- and not at all costs but efficiently and cheaply and some such plans exist things like swarms of mirrors in space to deflect the sunlight away and encouraging aquatic organisms to eat more carbon dioxide at the moment these things are fringe research they 're not central to the human effort to face this problem or problems in general and with problems that we are not aware of yet the ability to put right -- not the sheer good luck of avoiding indefinitely -- is our only hope not just of solving problems but of survival so take two stone tablets and carve on them on one of them carve : " problems are soluble " and on the other one carve : " problems are inevitable " thank you like many of you here i am trying to contribute towards a renaissance in africa the question of transformation in africa really is a question of leadership africa can only be transformed by enlightened leaders and it is my contention that the manner in which we educate our leaders is fundamental to progress on this continent i want to tell you some stories that explain my view we all heard about the importance of stories yesterday an american friend of mine this year volunteered as a nurse in ghana and in a period of three months she came to a conclusion about the state of leadership in africa that had taken me over a decade to reach twice she was involved in surgeries where they lost power at the hospital the emergency generators did not start there was not a flashlight not a lantern not a candle -- pitch black the patient 's cut open twice the first time it was a c-section thankfully baby was out -- mother and child survived the second time was a procedure that involved local anesthesia anesthetic wears off the patient feels pain he 's crying he 's screaming he 's praying pitch black not a candle not a flashlight and that hospital could have afforded flashlights they could have afforded to purchase these things but they did n't and it happened twice another time she watched in horror as nurses watched a patient die because they refused to give her oxygen that they had and so three months later just before she returned to the united states nurses in accra go on strike and her recommendation is take this opportunity to fire everyone start all over again start all over again now what does this have to do with leadership you see the folks at the ministry of health the hospital administrators the doctors the nurses -- they are among just five percent of their peers who get an education after secondary school they are the elite they are our leaders their decisions their actions matter and when they fail a nation literally suffers so when i speak of leadership i 'm not talking about just political leaders we 've heard a lot about that i 'm talking about the elite those who 've been trained whose job it is to be the guardians of their society the lawyers the judges the policemen the doctors the engineers the civil servants -- those are the leaders and we need to train them right now my first pointed and memorable experience with leadership in ghana occurred when i was 16 years old we had just had a military coup and soldiers were pervasive in our society they were a pervasive presence and one day i go to the airport to meet my father and as i walk up this grassy slope from the car park to the terminal building i 'm stopped by two soldiers wielding ak-47 assault weapons and they asked me to join a crowd of people that were running up and down this embankment why because the path i had taken was considered out of bounds no sign to this effect now i was 16 i was very worried about what my peers at school might think if they saw me running up and down this hill i was especially concerned of what the girls might think and so i started to argue with these men it was a little reckless but you know i was 16 i got lucky a ghana airways pilot falls into the same predicament because of his uniform they speak to him differently and they explain to him that they 're just following orders so he takes their radio talks to their boss and gets us all released what lessons would you take from an experience like this several for me leadership matters those men are following the orders of a superior officer i learned something about courage it was important not to look at those guns and i also learned that it can be helpful to think about girls so a few years after this event i leave ghana on a scholarship to go to swarthmore college for my education it was a breath of fresh air you know the faculty there did n't want us to memorize information and repeat back to them as i was used to back in ghana they wanted us to think critically they wanted us to be analytical they wanted us to be concerned about social issues in my economics classes i got high marks for my understanding of basic economics but i learned something more profound than that which is that the leaders -- the managers of ghana 's economy -- were making breathtakingly bad decisions that had brought our economy to the brink of collapse and so here was this lesson again -- leadership matters it matters a great deal but i did n't really fully understand what had happened to me at swarthmore i had an inkling but i did n't fully realize it until i went out into the workplace and i went to work at microsoft corporation and i was part of this team -- this thinking learning team whose job it was to design and implement new software that created value in the world and it was brilliant to be part of this team it was brilliant and i realized just what had happened to me at swarthmore this transformation -- the ability to confront problems complex problems and to design solutions to those problems the ability to create is the most empowering thing that can happen to an individual and i was part of that now while i was at microsoft the annual revenues of that company grew larger than the gdp of the republic of ghana and by the way it 's continued to the gap has widened since i left now i 've already spoken about one of the reasons why this has occurred i mean it 's the people there who are so hardworking persistent creative empowered but there were also some external factors : free markets the rule of law infrastructure these things were provided by institutions run by the people that i call leaders and those leaders did not emerge spontaneously somebody trained them to do the work that they do now while i was at microsoft this funny thing happened i became a parent and for the first time africa mattered more to me than ever before because i realized that the state of the african continent would matter to my children and their children that the state of the world -- the state of the world depends on what 's happening to africa as far as my kids would be concerned and at this time when i was going through what i call my " pre-mid-life crisis " africa was a mess somalia had disintegrated into anarchy rwanda was in the throes of this genocidal war and it seemed to me that that was the wrong direction and i needed to be back helping i could n't just stay in seattle and raise my kids in an upper-middle class neighborhood and feel good about it this was not the world that i 'd want my children to grow up in so i decided to get engaged and the first thing that i did was to come back to ghana and talk with a lot of people and really try to understand what the real issues were and three things kept coming up for every problem : corruption weak institutions and the people who run them -- the leaders now i was a little scared because when you see those three problems they seem really hard to deal with and they might say " look do n't even try " but for me i asked the question " well where are these leaders coming from what is it about ghana that produces leaders that are unethical or unable to solve problems " so i went to look at what was happening in our educational system and it was the same -- learning by rote -- from primary school through graduate school very little emphasis on ethics and the typical graduate from a university in ghana has a stronger sense of entitlement than a sense of responsibility this is wrong so i decided to engage this particular problem because it seems to me that every society every society must be very intentional about how it trains its leaders and ghana was not paying enough attention and this is true across sub-saharan africa actually so this is what i 'm doing now i 'm trying to bring the experience that i had at swarthmore to africa i wish there was a liberal arts college in every african country i think it would make a huge difference and what ashesi university is trying to do is to train a new generation of ethical entrepreneurial leaders we 're trying to train leaders of exceptional integrity who have the ability to confront the complex problems ask the right questions and come up with workable solutions i 'll admit that there are times when it seems like " mission : impossible " but we must believe that these kids are smart that if we involve them in their education if we have them discuss the real issues that they confront -- that our whole society confronts -- and if we give them skills that enable them to engage the real world that magic will happen now a month into this project we 'd just started classes and a month into it i come to the office and i have this email from one of our students and it said very simply " i am thinking now " and he signs off " thank you " it 's such a simple statement but i was moved almost to tears because i understood what was happening to this young man and it is an awesome thing to be a part of empowering someone in this way i am thinking now this year we challenged our students to craft an honor code themselves there 's a very vibrant debate going on on campus now over whether they should have an honor code and if so what it should look like one of the students asked a question that just warmed my heart can we create a perfect society her understanding that a student-crafted honor code constitutes a reach towards perfection is incredible now we can not achieve perfection but if we reach for it then we can achieve excellence i do n't know ultimately what they will do i do n't know whether they will decide to have this honor code but the conversation they 're having now -- about what their good society should look like what their excellent society should look like is a really good thing am i out of time ok now i just wanted to leave that slide up because it 's important that we think about it i 'm very excited about the fact that every student at ashesi university does community service before they graduate that for many of them it has been a life-altering experience these young future leaders are beginning to understand the real business of leadership the real privilege of leadership which is after all to serve humanity i am even more thrilled by the fact that least year our student body elected a woman to be the head of student government it 's the first time in the history of ghana that a woman has been elected head of student government at any university it says a lot about her it says a lot about the culture that 's forming on campus it says a lot about her peers who elected her she won with 75 percent of the vote and it gives me a lot of hope it turns out that corporate west africa also appreciates what 's happening with our students we 've graduated two classes of students to date and every single one of them has been placed and we 're getting great reports back from corporate ghana corporate west africa and the things that they 're most impressed about is work ethic you know that passion for what they 're doing the persistence their ability to deal with ambiguity their ability to tackle problems that they have n't seen before this is good because over the past five years there have been times when i 've felt this is " mission : impossible " and it 's just wonderful to see these glimmers of the promise of what can happen if we train our kids right i think that the current and future leaders of africa have an incredible opportunity to drive a major renaissance on the continent it 's an incredible opportunity there are n't very many more opportunities like this in the world i believe that africa has reached an inflection point with a march of democracy and free markets across the continent we have reached a moment from which can emerge a great society within one generation it will depend on inspired leadership and it is my contention that the manner in which we train our leaders will make all the difference thank you and god bless i 've been in afghanistan for 21 years i work for the red cross and i 'm a physical therapist my job is to make arms and legs -- well it 's not completely true we do more than that we provide the patients the afghan disabled first with the physical rehabilitation then with the social reintegration it 's a very logical plan but it was not always like this for many years we were just providing them with artificial limbs it took quite many years for the program to become what it is now today i would like to tell you a story the story of a big change and the story of the people who made this change possible i arrived in afghanistan in 1990 to work in a hospital for war victims and then not only for war victims but it was for any kind of patient i was also working in the orthopedic center we call it this is the place where we make the legs at that time i found myself in a strange situation i felt not quite ready for that job there was so much to learn there were so many things new to me but it was a terrific job but as soon as the fighting intensified the physical rehabilitation was suspended there were many other things to do so the orthopedic center was closed because physical rehabilitation was not considered a priority it was a strange sensation anyway you know every time i make this speech -- it 's not the first time -- but it 's an emotion it 's something that comes out from the past it 's 21 years but they are still all there anyway in 1992 the mujahideen took all afghanistan and the orthopedic center was closed i was assigned to work for the homeless for the internally displaced people but one day something happened i was coming back from a big food distribution in a mosque where tens and tens of people were squatting in terrible conditions i wanted to go home i was driving you know when you want to forget you do n't want to see things so you just want to go to your room to lock yourself inside and say " that 's enough " a bomb fell not far from my car -- well far enough but big noise and everybody disappeared from the street the cars disappeared as well i ducked and only one figure remained in the middle of the road it was a man in a wheelchair desperately trying to move away well i 'm not a particularly brave person i have to confess it but i could not just ignore him so i stopped the car and i went to help the man was without legs and only with one arm behind him there was a child his son red in the face in an effort to push the father so i took him into a safe place and i ask " what are you doing out in the street in this situation " " i work " he said i wondered what work and then i ask an even more stupid question : " why do n't you have the prostheses why do n't you have the artificial legs " and he said " the red cross has closed " well without thinking i told him " come tomorrow we will provide you with a pair of legs " the man his name was mahmoud and the child whose name was rafi left and then i said " oh my god what did i say the center is closed no staff around maybe the machinery is broken who is going to make the legs for him " so i hoped that he would not come this is the streets of kabul in those days so i said " well i will give him some money " and so the following day i went to the orthopedic center and i spoke with a gatekeeper i was ready to tell him " listen if someone such-and-such comes tomorrow please tell him that it was a mistake nothing can be done give him some money " but mahmoud and his son were already there and they were not alone there were 15 maybe 20 people like him waiting and there was some staff too among them there was my right-hand man najmuddin and the gatekeeper told me " they come everyday to see if the center will open " i said " no we have to go away we can not stay here " they were bombing -- not very close -- but you could hear the noise of the bombs so " we can not stay here it 's dangerous it 's not a priority " but najmuddin told me " listen now we 're here " at least we can start repairing the prostheses the broken prostheses of the people and maybe try to do something for people like mahmoud " i said " no please we can not do that it 's really dangerous we have other things to do " but they insisted when you have 20 people in front of you looking at you and you are the one who has to decide â€¦ so we started doing some repairs also one of the physical therapists reported that mahmoud could be provided with a leg but not immediately the legs were swollen and the knees were stiff so he needed a long preparation believe me i was worried because i was breaking the rules i was doing something that i was not supposed to do in the evening i went to speak with the bosses at the headquarters and i told them -- i lied -- i told them " listen we are going to start a couple of hours per day just a few repairs " maybe some of them are here now so we started i was working i was going everyday to work for the homeless and najmuddin was staying there doing everything and reporting on the patients he was telling me " patients are coming " we knew that many more patients could not come prevented by the fighting but people were coming and mahmoud was coming every day and slowly slowly week after week his legs were improving the stump or cast prosthesis was made and he was starting the real physical rehabilitation he was coming every day crossing the front line a couple of times i crossed the front line in the very place where mahmoud and his son were crossing i tell you it was something so sinister that i was astonished he could do it every day but finally the great day arrived mahmoud was going to be discharged with his new legs it was april i remember a very beautiful day april in kabul is beautiful full of roses full of flowers we could not possibly stay indoors with all these sandbags at the windows very sad dark so we chose a small spot in the garden and mahmoud put on his prostheses the other patients did the same and they started practicing for the last time before being discharged suddenly they started fighting two groups of mujahideen started fighting we could hear in the air the bullets passing so we dashed all of us towards the shelter mahmoud grabbed his son i grabbed someone else everybody was grabbing something and we ran you know 50 meters can be a long distance if you are totally exposed but we managed to reach the shelter inside all of us panting i sat a moment and i heard rafi telling his father " father you can run faster than me " and mahmoud " of course i can i can run and now you can go to school no need of staying with me all the day pushing my wheelchair " later on we took them home and i will never forget mahmoud and his son walking together pushing the empty wheelchair and then i understood physical rehabilitation is a priority dignity can not wait for better times from that day on we never closed a single day well sometimes we were suspended for a few hours but we never we never closed it again i met mahmoud one year later he was in good shape -- a bit thinner he needed to change his prostheses -- a new pair of prostheses i asked about his son he told me " he 's at school he 'd doing quite well " but i understood he wanted to tell me something so i asked him " what is that " he was sweating he was clearly embarrassed and he was standing in front of me his head down he said " you have taught me to walk thank you very much now help me not to be a beggar anymore " that was the job " my children are growing i feel ashamed i do n't want them to be teased at school by the other students " i said " okay " i thought how much money do i have in my pocket just to give him some money it was the easiest way he read my mind and he said " i ask for a job " and then he added something i will never forget for the rest of my life he said " i am a scrap of a man but if you help me i 'm ready to do anything even if i have to crawl on the ground " and then he sat down i sat down too with goosebumps everywhere legless with only one arm illiterate unskilled -- what job for him najmuddin told me " well we have a vacancy in the carpentry shop " " what " i said " stop " " well yes we need to increase the production of feet we need to employ someone to glue and to screw the sole of the feet we need to increase the production " " excuse me " i could not believe and then he said " no we can modify the workbench maybe to put a special stool a special anvil special vice and maybe an electric screwdriver " i said " listen it 's insane and it 's even cruel to think of anything like this that 's a production line and a very fast one it 's cruel to offer him a job knowing that he 's going to fail " but with najmuddin we can not discuss so the only things i could manage to obtain was a kind of a compromise only one week -- one week try and not a single day more one week later mahmoud was the fastest in the production line i told najmuddin " that 's a trick i ca n't believe it " the production was up 20 percent " it 's a trick it 's a trick " i said and then i asked for verification it was true the comment of najmuddin was mahmoud has something to prove i understood that i was wrong again mahmoud had looked taller i remember him sitting behind the workbench smiling he was a new man taller again of course i understood that what made him stand tall -- yeah they were the legs thank you very much -- but as a first step it was the dignity he has regained his full dignity thanks to that job so of course i understood and then we started a new policy -- a new policy completely different we decided to employ as many disabled as possible to train them in any possible job it became a policy of " positive discrimination " we call it now and you know what it 's good for everybody everybody benefits from that -- those employed of course because they get a job and dignity but also for the newcomers they are 7,000 every year -- people coming for the first time and you should see the faces of these people when they realize that those assisting them are like them sometimes you see them they look " oh " and you see the faces and then the surprise turns into hope and it 's easy for me as well to train someone who has already passed through the experience of disability poof they learn much faster -- the motivation the empathy they can establish with the patient is completely different completely scraps of men do not exist people like mahmoud are agents of change and when you start changing you can not stop so employing people yes but also we started programming projects of microfinance education and when you start you can not stop so you do vocational training home education for those who can not go to school physical therapies can be done not only in the orthopedic center but also in the houses of the people there is always a better way to do things that 's najmuddin the one with the white coat terrible najmuddin is that one i have learned a lot from people like najmuddin mahmoud rafi they are my teachers i have a wish a big wish that this way of working this way of thinking is going to be implemented in other countries there are plenty of countries at war like afghanistan it is possible and it is not difficult all we have to do is to listen to the people that we are supposed assist to make them part of the decision-making process and then of course to adapt this is my big wish well do n't think that the changes in afghanistan are over ; not at all we are going on recently we have just started a program a sport program -- basketball for wheelchair users we transport the wheelchairs everywhere we have several teams in the main part of afghanistan at the beginning when anajulina told me " we would like to start it " i hesitated i said " no " you can imagine i said " no no no no we ca n't " and then i asked the usual question : " is it a priority is it really necessary " well now you should see me i never miss a single training session the night before a match i 'm very nervous and you should see me during the match i shout like a true italian what 's next what is going to be the next change well i do n't know yet but i 'm sure najmuddin and his friends they have it already in mind that was my story thank you very much planetary systems outside our own are like distant cities whose lights we can see twinkling but whose streets we ca n't walk by studying those twinkling lights though we can learn about how stars and planets interact to form their own ecosystem and make habitats that are amenable to life in this image of the tokyo skyline i 've hidden data from the newest planet-hunting space telescope on the block the kepler mission can you see it there we go this is just a tiny part of the sky the kepler stares at where it searches for planets by measuring the light from over 150,000 stars all at once every half hour and very precisely and what we 're looking for is the tiny dimming of light that is caused by a planet passing in front of one of these stars and blocking some of that starlight from getting to us in just over two years of operations we 've found over 1,200 potential new planetary systems around other stars to give you some perspective in the previous two decades of searching we had only known about 400 prior to kepler when we see these little dips in the light we can determine a number of things for one thing we can determine that there 's a planet there but also how big that planet is and how far it is away from its parent star that distance is really important because it tells us how much light the planet receives overall and that distance and knowing that amount of light is important because it 's a little like you or i sitting around a campfire : you want to be close enough to the campfire so that you 're warm but not so close that you 're too toasty and you get burned however there 's more to know about your parent star than just how much light you receive overall and i 'll tell you why this is our star this is our sun it 's shown here in visible light that 's the light that you can see with your own human eyes you 'll notice that it looks pretty much like the iconic yellow ball -- that sun that we all draw when we 're children but you 'll notice something else and that 's that the face of the sun has freckles these freckles are called sunspots and they are just one of the manifestations of the sun 's magnetic field they also cause the light from the star to vary and we can measure this very very precisely with kepler and trace their effects however these are just the tip of the iceberg if we had uv eyes or x-ray eyes we would really see the dynamic and dramatic effects of our sun 's magnetic activity -- the kind of thing that happens on other stars as well just think even when it 's cloudy outside these kind of events are happening in the sky above you all the time so when we want to learn whether a planet is habitable whether it might be amenable to life we want to know not only how much total light it receives and how warm it is but we want to know about its space weather -- this high-energy radiation the uv and the x-rays that are created by its star and that bathe it in this bath of high-energy radiation and so we ca n't really look at planets around other stars in the same kind of detail that we can look at planets in our own solar system i 'm showing here venus earth and mars -- three planets in our own solar system that are roughly the same size but only one of which is really a good place to live but what we can do in the meantime is measure the light from our stars and learn about this relationship between the planets and their parent stars to suss out clues about which planets might be good places to look for life in the universe kepler wo n't find a planet around every single star it looks at but really every measurement it makes is precious because it 's teaching us about the relationship between stars and planets and how it 's really the starlight that sets the stage for the formation of life in the universe while it 's kepler the telescope the instrument that stares it 's we life who are searching thank you good morning happy to see so many fine folks out here and so many smiling faces i have a very peculiar background attitude and approach to the real world because i am a conjurer now i prefer that term over magician because if i were a magician that would mean that i use spells and incantations and weird gestures in order to accomplish real magic no i do n't do that ; i 'm a conjurer who is someone who pretends to be a real magician now how do we go about that sort of thing we depend on the fact that audiences such as yourselves will make assumptions for example when i walked up here and i took the microphone from the stand and switched it on you assumed this was a microphone which it is not as a matter of fact this is something that about half of you more than half of you will not be familiar with it 's a beard trimmer you see and it makes a very bad microphone ; i 've tried it many times the other assumption that you made -- and this little lesson is to show you that you will make assumptions not only that you can but that you will when they are properly suggested to you you believe i 'm looking at you wrong i 'm not looking at you i ca n't see you i know you 're out there they told me backstage it 's a full house and such i know you 're there because i can hear you but i ca n't see you because i normally wear glasses these are not glasses these are empty frames quite empty frames now why would a grown man appear before you wearing empty frames on his face to fool you ladies and gentlemen to deceive you to show that you too can make assumptions do n't you ever forget that now i have to do something -- first of all switch to real glasses so i can actually see you which would probably be a convenience i do n't know i have n't had a good look well it 's not that great a convenience i have to do something now which seems a little bit strange for a magician but i 'm going to take some medication this is a full bottle of calms forte i 'll explain that in just a moment ignore the instructions that 's what the government has to put in there to confuse you i 'm sure i will take enough of these mm indeed the whole container thirty-two tablets of calms forte now that i 've done that -- i 'll explain it in a moment -- i must tell you that i am an actor i 'm an actor who plays a specific part i play the part of a magician a wizard if you will a real wizard if someone were to appear on this stage in front of me and actually claim to be an ancient prince of denmark named hamlet you would be insulted and rightly so why would a man assume that you would believe something bizarre like this but there exists out there a very large population of people who will tell you that they have psychic magical powers that they can predict the future that they can make contact with the deceased oh they also say they will sell you astrology or other fortunetelling methods oh they gladly sell you that yes and they also say that they can give you perpetual motion machines and free energy systems they claim to be psychics or sensitives whatever they can but the one thing that has made a big comeback just recently is this business of speaking with the dead now to my innocent mind dead implies incapable of communicating you might agree with me on that but these people they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead -- " hi there " -- but they can hear the dead as well and they can relay this information back to the living i wonder if that 's true i do n't think so because this subculture of people use exactly the same gimmicks that we magicians do exactly the same -- the same physical methods the same psychological methods -- and they effectively and profoundly deceive millions of people around the earth to their detriment they deceive these people costs them a lot of money cost them a lot of emotional anguish billions of dollars are spent every year all over the globe on these charlatans now i have two questions i would like to ask these people if i had the opportunity to do so first question : if i want to ask them to call up -- because they do hear them through the ear they listen to the spirits like this -- i 'm going to ask you to call up the ghost of my grandmother because when she died she had the family will and she secreted it someplace we do n't know where it is so we ask granny " where is the will granny " what does granny say she says " i 'm in heaven and it 's wonderful i 'm here with all my old friends my deceased friends and my family and all the puppy dogs and the kittens that i used to have when i was a little girl and i love you and i 'll always be with you good bye " and she did n't answer the damn question ! where is the will now she could easily have said " oh it 's in the library on the second shelf behind the encyclopedia " but she does n't say that no she does n't she does n't bring any useful information to us we paid a lot of money for that information be we did n't get it the second question that i 'd like to ask rather simple : suppose i ask them to contact the spirit of my deceased father-in-law as an example why do they insist on saying -- remember they speak into this ear -- why do they say " my name starts with j or m " is this a hunting game hunting and fishing what is it is it 20 questions no it 's more like 120 questions but it is a cruel vicious absolutely conscienceless -- i 'll be all right keep your seats -- game that these people play and they take advantage of the innocent the naive the grieving the needy people out there now this is a process that is called cold reading there 's one fellow out there van praagh is his name james van praagh he 's one of the big practitioners of this sort of thing john edward sylvia browne and rosemary altea they are other operators there are hundreds of them all over the earth but in this country james van praagh is very big and what does he do he likes to tell you how the deceased got deceased the people he 's talking to through his ear you see so what he says is very often is like this : he says " he tells me he tells me before he passed that he had trouble breathing " folks that 's what dying is all about ! you stop breathing and then you 're dead it 's that simple and that 's the kind of information they 're going to bring back to you i do n't think so now these people will make guesses they 'll say things like " why am i getting electricity he 's saying to me 'electricity ' was he an electrician " " no " " did he ever have an electric razor " " no " it was a game of hunting questions like this this is what they go through now folks often ask us at the james randi educational foundation they call me they say " why are you so concerned about this mr. randi is n't it just a lot of fun " no it is not fun it is a cruel farce now it may bring a certain amount of comfort but that comfort lasts only about 20 minutes or so and then the people look in the mirror and they say i just paid a lot of money for that reading and what did she say to me 'i love you ! ' " they always say that they do n't get any information they do n't get any value for what they spend now sylvia browne is the big operator we call her " the talons " sylvia browne -- thank you -- sylvia browne is the big operator in this field at this very moment now sylvia browne -- just to show you -- she actually gets 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone she does n't even go there in person and you have to wait up to two years because she 's booked ahead that amount of time you pay by credit card or whatever and then she will call you sometime in the next two years you can tell it 's her " hello this is sylvia browne " that 's her you can tell right away now montel williams is an intelligent man we all know who he is on television he 's well educated he 's smart he knows what sylvia browne is doing but he does n't give a damn he just does n't care because the bottom line is the sponsors love it and he will expose her to television publicity all the time now what does sylvia browne give you for that 700 dollars she gives you the names of your guardian angels that 's first now without that how could we possibly function she gives you the names of previous lives who you were in previous lives duh it turns out that the women that she gives readings for were all babylonian princesses or something like that and the men were all grecian warriors fighting with agamemnon nothing is ever said about a 14 year-old bootblack in the streets of london who died of consumption he is n't worth bringing back obviously and the strange thing -- folks you may have noticed this too you see these folks on television -- they never call anybody back from hell everyone comes back from heaven but never from hell if they call back any of my friends they 're not going to â€¦ well you see the story now sylvia browne is an exception an exception in one way because the james randi educational foundation my foundation offers a one million dollar prize in negotiable bonds very simply won all you have to do is prove any paranormal occult or supernatural event or power of any kind under proper observing conditions it 's very easy win the million dollars sylvia browne is an exception in that she 's the only professional psychic in the whole world that has accepted our challenge she did this on the " larry king live " show on cnn six and a half years ago and we have n't heard from her since strange she said that first of all that she did n't know how to contact me duh a professional psychic who speaks to dead people she ca n't reach me i 'm alive you may have noticed well pretty well anyway she could n't reach me now she says she does n't want to reach me because i 'm a godless person all the more reason to take the million dollars would n't you think sylvia now these people need to be stopped seriously now they need to be stopped because this is a cruel farce we get people coming to the foundation all the time they 're ruined financially and emotionally because they 've given their money and their faith to these people now i popped some pills earlier i have to explain that to you homeopathy let 's find out what that 's all about hmm you 've heard of it it 's an alternative form of healing right homeopathy actually consists -- and that 's what this is this is calms forte 32 caplets of sleeping pills ! i forgot to tell you that i just ingested six and a half days worth of sleeping pills six and a half days that certainly is a fatal dose it says right on the back here " in case of overdose contact your poison control center immediately " and it gives an 800 number keep your seats -- it 's going to be okay i do n't really need it because i 've been doing this stunt for audiences all over the world for the last eight or 10 years taking fatal doses of homeopathic sleeping pills why do n't they affect me the answer may surprise you what is homeopathy it 's taking a medicine that really works and diluting it down well beyond avogadro 's limit diluting it down to the point where there 's none of it left now folks this is not just a metaphor i 'm going to give you now it 's true it 's exactly equivalent to taking one 325 milligram aspirin tablet throwing it into the middle of lake tahoe and then stirring it up obviously with a very big stick and waiting two years or so until the solution is homogeneous then when you get a headache you take a sip of this water and -- voila ! -- it is gone now that is true that is what homeopathy is all about and another claim that they make -- you 'll love this one -- the more dilute the medicine is they say the more powerful it is now wait a minute we heard about a guy in florida the poor man he was on homeopathic medicine he died of an overdose he forgot to take his pill work on it work on it it 's a ridiculous thing it is absolutely ridiculous i do n't know what we 're doing believing in all this nonsense over all these years now let me tell you the james randi educational foundation is waving this very big carrot but i must say the fact that nobody has taken us up on this offer does n't mean that the powers do n't exist they might some place out there maybe these people are just independently wealthy well with sylvia browne i would think so you know 700 dollars for a 20 minute reading over the telephone -- that 's more than lawyers make ! i mean that 's a fabulous amount of money these people do n't need the million dollars perhaps but would n't you think they 'd like to take it just to make me look silly just to get rid of this godless person out there that sylvia browne talks about all the time i think that something needs to be done about this we really would love to have suggestions from you folks on how to contact federal state and local authorities to get them to do something if you find out -- now i understand we 've seen people even today speaking to us about aids epidemics and starving kids around the world and impure water supplies that people have to suffer with those are very important critically important to us and we must do something about those problems but at the same time as arthur c. clarke said the rotting of the human mind the business of believing in the paranormal and the occult and the supernatural -- all of this total nonsense this medieval thinking -- i think something should be done about that and it all lies in education largely it 's the media who are to blame for this sort of thing they shamelessly promote all kinds of nonsense of this sort because it pleases the sponsors it 's the bottom line the dollar line that 's what they 're looking at we really must do something about this i 'm willing to take your suggestions and i 'm willing to have you tune in to our webpage it 's www.randi.org go in there and look at the archives and you will begin to understand much more of what i 've been talking about today you will see the records that we have there 's nothing like sitting in that library and having a family appear there and say that mum gave away all the family fortune she cashed in the cds she gave away the stocks and the certificates that 's really sad to hear and it has n't helped them one bit has n't solved any of their problems yes there could be a rotting of the american mind and of the minds all the way around the earth if we do n't start to think sensibly about these things now we 've offered this carrot as i say we 've dangled the carrot we 're waiting for the psychics to come forth and snap at it oh we get lots of them hundreds of them every year come by these are dowsers and people who think that they can talk to the dead as well but they 're amateurs ; they do n't know how to evaluate their own so-called powers the professionals never come near us except in that case of sylvia browne that i told you about a moment ago she did accept and then backed away ladies and gentlemen i 'm james randi and i 'm waiting thank you take a look at this picture it poses a very fascinating puzzle for us these african students are doing their homework under streetlights at the airport in the capital city because they do n't have any electricity at home now i have n't met these particular students but i 've met students like them let 's just pick one -- for example the one in the green shirt let 's give him a name too : nelson i 'll bet nelson has a cellphone so here is the puzzle why is it that nelson has access to a cutting-edge technology like the cellphone but does n't have access to a 100-year-old technology for generating electric light in the home now in a word the answer is " rules " bad rules can prevent the kind of win-win solution that 's available when people can bring new technologies in and make them available to someone like nelson what kinds of rules the electric company in this nation operates under a rule which says that it has to sell electricity at a very low subsidized price -- in fact a price that is so low it loses money on every unit that it sells so it has neither the resources nor the incentives to hook up many other users the president wanted to change this rule he 's seen that it 's possible to have a different set of rules rules where businesses earn a small profit so they have an incentive to sign up more customers that 's the kind of rules that the cellphone company that nelson purchases his telephony from operates under the president has seen how those rules worked well so he tried to change the rules for pricing on electricity but ran into a firestorm of protest from businesses and consumers who wanted to preserve the existing subsidized rates so he was stuck with rules that prevented him from letting the win-win solution help his country and nelson is stuck studying under the streetlights the real challenge then is to try to figure out how we can change rules are there some rules we can develop for changing rules i want to argue that there is a general abstract insight that we can make practical which is that if we can give more choices to people and more choices to leaders -- who in many countries are also people but it 's useful to present the opposition between these two because the kind of choice you might want to give to a leader a choice like giving the president the choice to raise prices on electricity takes away a choice that people in the economy want they want the choice to be able to continue consuming subsidized electric power so if you give just to one side or the other you 'll have tension or friction but if we can find ways to give more choices to both that will give us a set of rules for changing rules that get us out of traps now nelson also has access to the internet and he says that if you want to see the damaging effects of rules the ways that rules can keep people in the dark look at the pictures from nasa of the earth at night in particular check out asia if you zoom in here you can see north korea in outline here which is like a black hole compared to its neighbors now you wo n't be surprised to learn that the rules in north korea keep people there in the dark but it is important to recognize that north korea and south korea started out with identical sets of rules in both the sense of laws and regulations but also in the deeper senses of understandings norms culture values and beliefs when they separated they made choices that led to very divergent paths for their sets of rules so we can change -- we as humans can change the rules that we use to interact with each other for better or for worse now let 's look at another region the caribbean zoom in on haiti in outline here haiti is also dark compared to its neighbor here the dominican republic which has about the same number of residents both of these countries are dark compared to puerto rico which has half as many residents as either haiti or the dominican republic what haiti warns us is that rules can be bad because governments are weak it 's not just that the rules are bad because the government is too strong and oppressive as in north korea so that if we want to create environments with good rules we ca n't just tear down we 've got to find ways to build up as well now china dramatically demonstrates both the potential and the challenges of working with rules back in the beginning of the data presented in this chart china was the world 's high-technology leader chinese had pioneered technologies like steel printing gunpowder but the chinese never adopted at least in that period effective rules for encouraging the spread of those ideas -- a profit motive that could have encouraged the spread and they soon adopted rules which slowed down innovation and cut china off from the rest of the world so as other countries in the world innovated in the sense both of developing newer technologies but also developing newer rules the chinese were cut off from those advances income there stayed stagnant as it zoomed ahead in the rest of the world this next chart looks at more recent data it plots income average income in china as a percentage of average income in the united states in the '50s and '60s you can see that it was hovering at about three percent but then in the late '70s something changed growth took off in china the chinese started catching up very quickly with the united states if you go back to the map at night you can get a clue to the process that lead to the dramatic change in rules in china the brightest spot in china which you can see on the edge of the outline here is hong kong hong kong was a small bit of china that for most of the 20th century operated under a very different set of rules than the rest of mainland china -- rules that were copied from working market economies of the time and administered by the british in the 1950s hong kong was a place where millions of people could go from the mainland to start in jobs like sewing shirts making toys but to get on a process of increasing income increasing skills led to very rapid growth there hong kong was also the model which leaders like deng xiaoping could copy when they decided to move all of the mainland towards the market model but deng xiaoping instinctively understood the importance of offering choices to his people so instead of forcing everyone in china to shift immediately to the market model they proceeded by creating some special zones that could do in a sense what britain did : make the opportunity to go work with the market rules available to the people who wanted to opt in there so they created four special economic zones around hong kong : zones where chinese could come and work and cities grew up very rapidly there ; also zones where foreign firms could come in and make things one of the zones next to hong kong has a city called shenzhen in that city there is a taiwanese firm that made the iphone that many of you have and they made it with labor from chinese who moved there to shenzhen so after the four special zones there were 14 coastal cites that were open in the same sense and eventually demonstrated successes in these places that people could opt in to that they flocked to because of the advantages they offered demonstrated successes there led to a consensus for a move toward the market model for the entire economy now the chinese example shows us several points one is : preserve choices for people two : operate on the right scale if you try to change the rules in a village you could do that but a village would be too small to get the kinds of benefits you can get if you have millions of people all working under good rules on the other hand the nation is too big if you try to change the rules in the nation you ca n't give some people a chance to hold back see how things turn out and let others zoom ahead and try the new rules but cities give you this opportunity to create new places with new rules that people can opt in to and they 're large enough to get all of the benefits that we can have when millions of us work together under good rules so the proposal is that we conceive of something called a charter city we start with a charter that specifies all the rules required to attract the people who we 'll need to build the city we 'll need to attract the investors who will build out the infrastructure -- the power system the roads the port the airport the buildings you 'll need to attract firms who will come hire the people who move there first and you 'll need to attract families the residents who will come and live there permanently raise their children get an education for their children and get their first job with that charter people will move there the city can be built and we can scale this model we can go do it over and over again to make it work we need good rules we 've already discussed that those are captured in the charter we also need the choices for people that 's really built into the model if we allow for the possibility of building cities on uninhabited land you start from uninhabited territory people can come live under the new charter but no one is forced to live under it the final thing we need are choices for leaders and to achieve the kind of choices we want for leaders we need to allow for the potential for partnerships between nations : cases where nations work together in effect de facto the way china and britain worked together to build first a little enclave of the market model and then scale it throughout china in a sense britain inadvertently through its actions in hong kong did more to reduce world poverty than all the aid programs that we 've undertaken in the last century so if we allow for these kind of partnerships to replicate this again we can get those kinds of benefits scaled throughout the world in some cases this will involve a delegation of responsibility a delegation of control from one country to another to take over certain kinds of administrative responsibilities now when i say that some of you are starting to think " well is this just bringing back colonialism " it 's not but it 's important to recognize that the kind of emotions that come up when we start to think about these things can get in the way can make us pull back can shut down our ability and our interest in trying to explore new ideas why is this not like colonialism the thing that was bad about colonialism and the thing which is residually bad in some of our aid programs is that it involved elements of coercion and condescension this model is all about choices both for leaders and for the people who will live in these new places and choice is the antidote to coercion and condescension so let 's talk about how this could play out in practice let 's take a particular leader raul castro who is the leader of cuba it must have occurred to castro that he has the chance to do for cuba what deng xiaoping did for china but he does n't have a hong kong there on the island in cuba he does though have a little bit of light down in the south that has a very special status there is a zone there around guantanamo bay where a treaty gives the united states administrative responsibility for a piece of land that 's about twice the size of manhattan castro goes to the prime minister of canada and says " look the yankees have a terrible pr problem they want to get out why do n't you canada take over build -- run a special administrative zone allow a new city to be built up there allow many people to come in let us have a hong kong nearby some of my citizens will move into that city as well others will hold back but this will be the gateway that will connect the modern economy and the modern world to my country " now where else might this model be tried well africa i 've talked with leaders in africa many of them totally get the notion of a special zone that people can opt into as a rule it 's a rule for changing rules it 's a way to create new rules and let people opt-in without coercion and the opposition that coercion can force they also totally get the idea that in some instances they can make more credible promises to long-term investors -- the kind of investors who will come build the port build the roads in a new city -- they can make more credible promises if they do it along with a partner nation perhaps even in some arrangement that 's a little bit like an escrow account where you put land in the escrow account and the partner nation takes responsibility for it there is also lots of land in africa where new cities could be built this is a picture i took when i was flying along the coast there are immense stretches of land like this -- land where hundreds of millions of people could live now if we generalize this and think about not just one or two charter cites but dozens -- cities that will help create places for the many hundreds of millions perhaps billions of people who will move to cities in the coming century -- is there enough land for them well throughout the world if we look at the lights at night the one thing that 's misleading is that visually it looks like most of the world is already built out so let me show you why that 's wrong take this representation of all of the land turn it into a square that stands for all the arable land on earth and let these dots represent the land that 's already taken up by the cities that three billion people now live in if you move the dots down to the bottom of the rectangle you can see that the cities for the existing three billion urban residents take up only three percent of the arable land on earth so if we wanted to build cities for another billion people they would be dots like this we 'd go from three percent of the arable land to four percent we 'd dramatically reduce the human footprint on earth by building more cities that people can move to and if these are cities governed by good rules they can be cities where people are safe from crime safe from disease and bad sanitation where people have a chance to get a job they can get basic utilities like electricity their kids can get an education so what will it take to get started building the first charter cities scaling this so we build many more it would help to have a manual what university professors could do is write some details that might go into this manual you would n't want to let us run the cities go out and design them you would n't let academics out in the wild but you could set us to work thinking about questions like suppose it is n't just canada that does the deal with raul castro perhaps brazil comes in as a participant and spain as well and perhaps cuba wants to be one of the partners in a four-way joint venture how would we write the treaty to do that there is less precedent for that but that could easily be worked out how would we finance this turns out singapore and hong kong are cities that made huge gains on the value of the land that they owned when they got started you could use the gains on the value of the land to pay for things like the police the courts but the school system and the health care system too which make this a more attractive place to live makes this a place where people have higher incomes -- which incidentally makes the land more valuable so the incentives for the people helping to construct this zone and build it and set up the basic rules go very much in the right direction so there are many other details like this how could we have buildings that are low cost and affordable for people who work in a first job assembling something like an iphone but make those buildings energy efficient and make sure that they are safe so they do n't fall down in an earthquake or a hurricane many technical details to be worked out but those of us who are already starting to pursue these things can already tell that there is no roadblock there 's no impediment other than a failure of imagination that will keep us from delivering on a truly global win-win solution let me conclude with this picture the reason we can be so well off even though there is so many people on earth is because of the power of ideas we can share ideas with other people and when they discover them they share with us it 's not like scarce objects where sharing means we each get less when we share ideas we all get more when we think about ideas in that way we usually think about technologies but there is another class of ideas : the rules that govern how we interact with each other ; rules like let 's have a tax system that supports a research university that gives away certain kinds of knowledge for free let 's have a system where we have ownership of land that is registered in a government office that people can pledge as collateral if we can keep innovating on our space of rules and particularly innovate in the sense of coming up with rules for changing rules so we do n't get stuck with bad rules then we can keep moving progress forward and truly make the world a better place so that people like nelson and his friends do n't have to study any longer under the streetlights thank you at the break i was asked by several people about my comments about the aging debate and this will be my only comment on it and that is i understand that optimists greatly outlive pessimists what i 'm going to tell you about in my 18 minutes is how we 're about to switch from reading the genetic code to the first stages of beginning to write the code ourselves it 's only 10 years ago this month when we published the first sequence of a free-living organism that of haemophilus influenzae that took a genome project from 13 years down to four months we can now do that same genome project in the order of two to eight hours so in the last decade a large number of genomes have been added : most human pathogens a couple of plants several insects and several mammals including the human genome genomics at this stage of the thinking from a little over 10 years ago was by the end of this year we might have between three and five genomes sequenced ; it 's on the order of several hundred we just got a grant from the gordon and betty moore foundation to sequence 130 genomes this year as a side project from environmental organisms so the rate of reading the genetic code has changed but as we look what 's out there we 've barely scratched the surface on what is available on this planet most people do n't realize it because they 're invisible but microbes make up about a half of the earth 's biomass whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass and maybe it 's something that people in oxford do n't do very often but if you ever make it to the sea and you swallow a mouthful of seawater keep in mind that each milliliter has about a million bacteria and on the order of 10 million viruses less than 5,000 microbial species have been characterized as of two years ago and so we decided to do something about it and we started the sorcerer ii expedition where we were as with great oceanographic expeditions trying to sample the ocean every 200 miles we started in bermuda for our test project then moved up to halifax working down the u.s. east coast the caribbean sea the panama canal through to the galapagos then across the pacific and we 're in the process now of working our way across the indian ocean it 's very tough duty ; we 're doing this on a sailing vessel in part to help excite young people about going into science the experiments are incredibly simple we just take seawater and we filter it and we collect different size organisms on different filters and then take their dna back to our lab in rockville where we can sequence a hundred million letters of the genetic code every 24 hours and with doing this we 've made some amazing discoveries for example it was thought that the visual pigments that are in our eyes -- there was only one or two organisms in the environment that had these same pigments it turns out almost every species in the upper parts of the ocean in warm parts of the world have these same photoreceptors and use sunlight as the source of their energy and communication from one site from one barrel of seawater we discovered 1.3 million new genes and as many as 50,000 new species we 've extended this to the air now with a grant from the sloan foundation we 're measuring how many viruses and bacteria all of us are breathing in and out every day particularly on airplanes or closed auditoriums we filter through some simple apparatuses ; we collect on the order of a billion microbes from just a day filtering on top of a building in new york city and we 're in the process of sequencing all that at the present time just on the data collection side just where we are through the galapagos we 're finding that almost every 200 miles we see tremendous diversity in the samples in the ocean some of these make logical sense in terms of different temperature gradients so this is a satellite photograph based on temperatures -- red being warm blue being cold -- and we found there 's a tremendous difference between the warm water samples and the cold water samples in terms of abundant species the other thing that surprised us quite a bit is these photoreceptors detect different wavelengths of light and we can predict that based on their amino acid sequence and these vary tremendously from region to region maybe not surprisingly in the deep ocean where it 's mostly blue the photoreceptors tend to see blue light when there 's a lot of chlorophyll around they see a lot of green light but they vary even more possibly moving towards infrared and ultraviolet in the extremes just to try and get an assessment of what our gene repertoire was we assembled all the data -- including all of ours thus far from the expedition which represents more than half of all the gene data on the planet -- and it totaled around 29 million genes and we tried to put these into gene families to see what these discoveries are : are we just discovering new members of known families or are we discovering new families and it turns out we have about 50,000 major gene families but every new sample we take in the environment adds in a linear fashion to these new families so we 're at the earliest stages of discovery about basic genes components and life on this planet when we look at the so-called evolutionary tree we 're up on the upper right-hand corner with the animals of those roughly 29 million genes we only have around 24,000 in our genome and if you take all animals together we probably share less than 30,000 and probably maybe a dozen or more thousand different gene families i view that these genes are now not only the design components of evolution and we think in a gene-centric view -- maybe going back to richard dawkins ' ideas -- than in a genome-centric view which are different constructs of these gene components synthetic dna the ability to synthesize dna has changed at sort of the same pace that dna sequencing has over the last decade or two and is getting very rapid and very cheap our first thought about synthetic genomics came when we sequenced the second genome back in 1995 and that from mycoplasma genitalium and we have really nice t-shirts that say you know " i heart my genitalium " this is actually just a microorganism but it has roughly 500 genes haemophilus had 1,800 genes and we simply asked the question if one species needs 800 another 500 is there a smaller set of genes that might comprise a minimal operating system so we started doing transposon mutagenesis transposons are just small pieces of dna that randomly insert in the genetic code and if they insert in the middle of the gene they disrupt its function so we made a map of all the genes that could take transposon insertions and we called those " non-essential genes " but it turns out the environment is very critical for this and you can only define an essential or non-essential gene based on exactly what 's in the environment we also tried to take a more directly intellectual approach with the genomes of 13 related organisms and we tried to compare all of those to see what they had in common and we got these overlapping circles and we found only 173 genes common to all 13 organisms the pool expanded a little bit if we ignored one intracellular parasite ; it expanded even more when we looked at core sets of genes of around 310 or so so we think that we can expand or contract genomes depending on your point of view here to maybe 300 to 400 genes from the minimal of 500 the only way to prove these ideas was to construct an artificial chromosome with those genes in them and we had to do this in a cassette-based fashion we found that synthesizing accurate dna in large pieces was extremely difficult ham smith and clyde hutchison my colleagues on this developed an exciting new method that allowed us to synthesize a 5,000-base pair virus in only a two-week period that was 100 percent accurate in terms of its sequence and its biology it was a quite exciting experiment -- when we just took the synthetic piece of dna injected it in the bacteria and all of a sudden that dna started driving the production of the virus particles that turned around and then killed the bacteria this was not the first synthetic virus -- a polio virus had been made a year before -- but it was only one ten-thousandth as active and it took three years to do this is a cartoon of the structure of phi x 174 this is a case where the software now builds its own hardware and that 's the notions that we have with biology people immediately jump to concerns about biological warfare and i had recent testimony before a senate committee and a special committee the u.s. government has set up to review this area and i think it 's important to keep reality in mind versus what happens with people 's imaginations basically any virus that 's been sequenced today -- that genome can be made and people immediately freak out about things about ebola or smallpox but the dna from this organism is not infective so even if somebody made the smallpox genome that dna itself would not cause infections the real concern that security departments have is designer viruses and there 's only two countries the u.s. and the former soviet union that had major efforts on trying to create biological warfare agents if that research is truly discontinued there should be very little activity on the know-how to make designer viruses in the future i think single-cell organisms are possible within two years and possibly eukaryotic cells those that we have are possible within a decade so we 're now making several dozen different constructs because we can vary the cassettes and the genes that go into this artificial chromosome the key is how do you put all of the others we start with these fragments and then we have a homologous recombination system that reassembles those into a chromosome this is derived from an organism deinococcus radiodurans that can take three million rads of radiation and not be killed it reassembles its genome after this radiation burst in about 12 to 24 hours after its chromosomes are literally blown apart this organism is ubiquitous on the planet and exists perhaps now in outer space due to all our travel there this is a glass beaker after about half a million rads of radiation the glass started to burn and crack while the microbes sitting in the bottom just got happier and happier here 's an actual picture of what happens : the top of this shows the genome after 1.7 million rads of radiation the chromosome is literally blown apart and here 's that same dna automatically reassembled 24 hours later it 's truly stunning that these organisms can do that and we probably have thousands if not tens of thousands of different species on this planet that are capable of doing that after these genomes are synthesized the first step is just transplanting them into a cell without a genome so we think synthetic cells are going to have tremendous potential not only for understanding the basis of biology but for hopefully environmental and society issues for example from the third organism we sequenced methanococcus jannaschii -- it lives in boiling water temperatures ; its energy source is hydrogen and all its carbon comes from co2 it captures back from the environment so we know lots of different pathways thousands of different organisms now that live off of co2 and can capture that back so instead of using carbon from oil for synthetic processes we have the chance of using carbon and capturing it back from the atmosphere converting that into biopolymers or other products we have one organism that lives off of carbon monoxide and we use as a reducing power to split water to produce hydrogen and oxygen also there 's numerous pathways that can be engineered metabolizing methane and dupont has a major program with statoil in norway to capture and convert the methane from the gas fields there into useful products within a short while i think there 's going to be a new field called " combinatorial genomics " because with these new synthesis capabilities these vast gene array repertoires and the homologous recombination we think we can design a robot to make maybe a million different chromosomes a day and therefore as with all biology you get selection through screening whether you 're screening for hydrogen production or chemical production or just viability to understand the role of these genes is going to be well within reach we 're trying to modify photosynthesis to produce hydrogen directly from sunlight photosynthesis is modulated by oxygen and we have an oxygen-insensitive hydrogenase that we think will totally change this process we 're also combining cellulases the enzymes that break down complex sugars into simple sugars and fermentation in the same cell for producing ethanol pharmaceutical production is already under way in major laboratories using microbes the chemistry from compounds in the environment is orders of magnitude more complex than our best chemists can produce i think future engineered species could be the source of food hopefully a source of energy environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry let me just close with ethical and policy studies we delayed the start of our experiments in 1999 until we completed a year-and-a-half bioethical review as to whether we should try and make an artificial species every major religion participated in this it was actually a very strange study because the various religious leaders were using their scriptures as law books and they could n't find anything in them prohibiting making life so it must be ok the only ultimate concerns were biological warfare aspects of this but gave us the go ahead to start these experiments for the reasons we were doing them right now the sloan foundation has just funded a multi-institutional study on this to work out what the risk and benefits to society are and the rules that scientific teams such as my own should be using in this area and we 're trying to set good examples as we go forward these are complex issues except for the threat of bio-terrorism they 're very simple issues in terms of can we design things to produce clean energy perhaps revolutionizing what developing countries can do and provide through various simple processes

marshmallows to wait what happens is two-thirds of the kids give in to temptation they can not wait the others of course wait they resist the temptation they delay the now for later walter mischel my colleague at stanford went back 14 years later to try to discover what was different about those kids there were enormous differences between kids who resisted and kids who yielded in many ways the kids who resisted scored 250 points higher on the sat that 's enormous that 's like a whole set of different iq points they did n't get in as much trouble they were better students they were self-confident and determined and the key for me today the key for you is they were future-focused rather than present-focused so what is time perspective that 's what i 'm going to talk about today time perspective is the study of how individuals all of us divide the flow of your human experience into time zones or time categories and you do it automatically and non-consciously they vary between cultures between nations between individuals between social classes between education levels and the problem is that they can become biased because you learn to over-use some of them and under-use the others what determines any decision you make you make a decision on which you 're going to base an action for some people it 's only about what is in the immediate situation what other people are doing and what you 're feeling and those people when they make their decisions in that format -- we 're going to call them " present-oriented " because their focus is what is now for others the present is irrelevant it 's always about " what is this situation like that i 've experienced in the past " so that their decisions are based on past memories and we 're going to call those people " past-oriented " because they focus on what was for others it 's not the past it 's not the present it 's only about the future their focus is always about anticipated consequences cost-benefit analysis we 're going to call them " future-oriented " their focus is on what will be so time paradox i want to argue the paradox of time perspective is something that influences every decision you make you 're totally unaware of namely the extent to which you have one of these biased time perspectives well there is actually six of them there are two ways to be present-oriented there is two ways to be past-oriented two ways to be future you can focus on past-positive or past-negative you can be present-hedonistic namely you focus on the joys of life or present-fatalist -- it does n't matter your life is controlled you can be future-oriented setting goals or you can be transcendental future : namely life begins after death developing the mental flexibility to shift time perspectives fluidly depending on the demands of the situation that 's what you 've got to learn to do so very quickly what is the optimal time profile high on past-positive moderately high on future and moderate on present-hedonism and always low on past-negative and present-fatalism so the optimal temporal mix is what you get from the past -- past-positive gives you roots you connect your family identity and your self what you get from the future is wings to soar to new destinations new challenges what you get from the present hedonism is the energy the energy to explore yourself places people sensuality any time perspective in excess has more negatives than positives what do futures sacrifice for success they sacrifice family time they sacrifice friend time they sacrifice fun time they sacrifice personal indulgence they sacrifice hobbies and they sacrifice sleep so it affects their health and they live for work achievement and control i 'm sure that resonates with some of the tedsters and it resonated for me i grew up as a poor kid in the south bronx ghetto a sicilian family -- everyone lived in the past and present i 'm here as a future-oriented person who went over the top who did all these sacrifices because teachers intervened and made me future oriented told me do n't eat that marshmallow because if you wait you 're going to get two of them until i learned to balance out i 've added present-hedonism i 've added a focus on the past-positive so at 76 years old i am more energetic than ever more productive and i 'm happier than i have ever been i just want to say that we are applying this to many world problems : changing the drop-out rates of school kids combating addictions enhancing teen health curing vets ' ptsd with time metaphors -- getting miracle cures -- promoting sustainability and conservation reducing physical rehabilitation where there is a 50-percent drop out rate altering appeals to suicidal terrorists and modifying family conflicts as time-zone clashes so i want to end by saying : many of life 's puzzles can be solved by understanding your time perspective and that of others and the idea is so simple so obvious but i think the consequences are really profound thank you so much i 'm going to talk to you today about the design of medical technology for low resource settings i study health systems in these countries and one of the major gaps in care almost across the board is access to safe surgery now one of the major bottlenecks that we 've found that 's sort of preventing both the access in the first place and the safety of those surgeries that do happen is anesthesia and actually it 's the model that we expect to work for delivering anesthesia in these environments here we have a scene that you would find in any operating room across the u.s. or any other developed country in the background there is a very sophisticated anesthesia machine and this machine is able to enable surgery and save lives because it was designed with this environment in mind in order to operate this machine needs a number of things that this hospital has to offer it needs an extremely well-trained anesthesiologist with years of training with complex machines to help her monitor the flows of the gas and keep her patients safe and anesthetized throughout the surgery it 's a delicate machine running on computer algorithms and it needs special care tlc to keep it up and running and it 's going to break pretty easily and when it does it needs a team of biomedical engineers who understand its complexities can fix it can source the parts and keep it saving lives it 's a pretty expensive machine it needs a hospital whose budget can allow it to support one machine costing upwards of 50 or $ 100,000 and perhaps most obviously and perhaps most importantly -- and the path to concepts that we 've heard about kind of illustrate this -- that can supply an uninterrupted source of electricity of compressed oxygen and other medical supplies that are so critical to the functioning of this machine in other words this machine requires a lot of stuff that this hospital can not offer this is the electrical supply for a hospital in rural malawi in this hospital there is one person qualified to deliver anesthesia and she 's qualified because she has 12 maybe 18 months of training in anesthesia in the hospital and in the entire region there 's not a single biomedical engineer so when this machine breaks the machines they have to work with break they 've got to try and figure it out but most of the time that 's the end of the road those machines go the proverbial junkyard and the price tag of the machine that i mentioned could represent maybe a quarter or a third of the annual operating budget for this hospital and finally i think you can see that infrastructure is not very strong this hospital is connected to a very weak power grid one that goes down frequently so it runs frequently the entire hospital just on a generator and you can imagine the generator breaks down or runs out of fuel and the world bank sees this and estimates that a hospital in this setting in a low-income country can expect up to 18 power outages per month similarly compressed oxygen and other medical supplies are really a luxury and can often be out of stock for months or even a year so it seems crazy but the model that we have right now is taking those machines that were designed for that first environment that i showed you and donating or selling them to hospitals in this environment it 's not just inappropriate it becomes really unsafe one of our partners at johns hopkins was observing surgeries in sierra leone about a year ago and the first surgery of the day happened to be an obstetrical case a woman came in she needed an emergency c-section to save her life and the life of her baby and everything began pretty auspiciously the surgeon was on call and scrubbed in the nurse was there she was able to anesthetize her quickly and it was important because of the emergency nature of the situation and everything began well until the power went out and now in the middle of this surgery the surgeon is racing against the clock to finish his case which he can do -- he 's got a headlamp but the nurse is literally running around a darkened operating theater trying to find anything she can use to anesthetize her patient to keep her patient asleep because her machine does n't work when there 's no power and now this routine surgery that many of you have probably experienced and others are probably the product of has now become a tragedy and what 's so frustrating is this is not a singular event ; this happens across the developing world 35 million surgeries are attempted every year without safe anesthesia my colleague dr. paul fenton was living this reality he was the chief of anesthesiology in a hospital in malawi a teaching hospital he went to work every day in an operating theater like this one trying to deliver anesthesia and teach others how to do so using that same equipment that became so unreliable and frankly unsafe in his hospital and after umpteen surgeries and you can imagine really unspeakable tragedy he just said " that 's it i 'm done that 's enough there has to be something better " so he took a walk down the hall to where they threw all those machines that had just crapped out on them -- i think that 's the scientific term -- and he just started tinkering he took one part from here and another from there and he tried to come up with a machine that would work in the reality that he was facing and what he came up with was this guy the prototype for the universal anesthesia machine -- a machine that would work and anesthetize his patients no matter the circumstances that his hospital had to offer here it is back at home at that same hospital developed a little further 12 years later working on patients from pediatrics to geriatrics now let me show you a little bit about how this machine works voila ! here she is when you have electricity everything in this machine begins in the base there 's a built-in oxygen concentrator down there now you 've heard me mention oxygen a few times at this point essentially to deliver anesthesia you want as pure oxygen as possible because eventually you 're going to dilute it essentially with the gas and the mixture that the patient inhales needs to be at least a certain percentage oxygen or else it can become dangerous but so in here when there 's electricity the oxygen concentrator takes in room air now we know room air is gloriously free it is abundant and it 's already 21 percent oxygen so all this concentrator does is take that room air in filter it and send 95 percent pure oxygen up and across here where it mixes with the anesthetic agent now before that mixture hits the patient 's lungs it 's going to pass by here -- you ca n't see it but there 's an oxygen sensor here -- that 's going to read out on this screen the percentage of oxygen being delivered now if you do n't have power or god forbid the power cuts out in the middle of surgery this machine transitions automatically without even having to touch it to drawing in room air from this inlet everything else is the same the only difference is that now you 're only working with 21 percent oxygen now that used to be a dangerous guessing game because you only knew if you had given too little oxygen once something bad happened but we 've put a long-life battery backup on here this is the only part that 's battery backed up but this gives control to the provider whether there 's power or not because they can adjust the flow based on the percentage of oxygen they see that they 're giving their patient in both cases whether you have power or not sometimes the patient needs help breathing it 's just a reality of anesthesia the lungs can be paralyzed and so we 've just added this manual bellows we 've seen surgeries for three or four hours to ventilate the patient on this so it 's a straightforward machine i shudder to say simple ; it 's straightforward and it 's by design and you do not need to be a highly trained specialized anesthesiologist to use this machine which is good because in these rural district hospitals you 're not going to get that level of training it 's also designed for the environment that it will be used in this is an incredibly rugged machine it has to stand up to the heat and the wear and tear that happens in hospitals in these rural districts and so it 's not going to break very easily but if it does virtually every piece in this machine can be swapped out and replaced with a hex wrench and a screwdriver and finally it 's affordable this machine comes in at an eighth of the cost of the conventional machine that i showed you earlier so in other words what we have here is a machine that can enable surgery and save lives because it was designed for its environment just like the first machine i showed you but we 're not content to stop there is it working is this the design that 's going to work in place well we 've seen good results so far this is in 13 hospitals in four countries and since 2010 we 've done well over 2,000 surgeries with no clinically adverse events so we 're thrilled this really seems like a cost-effective scalable solution to a problem that 's really pervasive but we still want to be sure that this is the most effective and safe device that we can be putting into hospitals so to do that we 've launched a number of partnerships with ngos and universities to gather data on the user interface on the types of surgeries it 's appropriate for and ways we can enhance the device itself one of those partnerships is with johns hopkins just here in baltimore they have a really cool anesthesia simulation lab out in baltimore so we 're taking this machine and recreating some of the operating theater crises that this machine might face in one of the hospitals that it 's intended for and in a contained safe environment evaluating its effectiveness we 're then able to compare the results from that study with real world experience because we 're putting two of these in hospitals that johns hopkins works with in sierra leone including the hospital where that emergency c-section happened so i 've talked a lot about anesthesia and i tend to do that i think it is incredibly fascinating and an important component of health and it really seems peripheral we never think about it until we do n't have access to it and then it becomes a gatekeeper who gets surgery and who does n't who gets safe surgery and who does n't but you know it 's just one of so many ways that design appropriate design can have an impact on health outcomes if more people in the health delivery space really working on some of these challenges in low-income countries could start their design process their solution search from outside of that proverbial box and inside of the hospital -- in other words if we could design for the environment that exists in so many parts of the world rather than the one that we wished existed -- we might just save a lot of lives thank you very much i write about food i write about cooking i take it quite seriously but i 'm here to talk about something that 's become very important to me in the last year or two it is about food but it 's not about cooking per se i 'm going to start with this picture of a beautiful cow i 'm not a vegetarian -- this is the old nixon line right but i still think that this -- -- may be this year 's version of this now that is only a little bit hyperbolic and why do i say it because only once before has the fate of individual people and the fate of all of humanity been so intertwined there was the bomb and there 's now and where we go from here is going to determine not only the quality and the length of our individual lives but whether if we could see the earth a century from now we 'd recognize it it 's a holocaust of a different kind and hiding under our desks is n't going to help start with the notion that global warming is not only real but dangerous since every scientist in the world now believes this and even president bush has seen the light or pretends to we can take this is a given then hear this please after energy production livestock is the second-highest contributor to atmosphere-altering gases nearly one-fifth of all greenhouse gas is generated by livestock production -- more than transportation now you can make all the jokes you want about cow farts but methane is 20 times more poisonous than co2 and it 's not just methane livestock is also one of the biggest culprits in land degradation air and water pollution water shortages and loss of biodiversity there 's more like half the antibiotics in this country are not administered to people but to animals but lists like this become kind of numbing so let me just say this : if you 're a progressive if you 're driving a prius or you 're shopping green or you 're looking for organic you should probably be a semi-vegetarian now i 'm no more anti-cattle than i am anti-atom but it 's all in the way we use these things there 's another piece of the puzzle which ann cooper talked about beautifully yesterday and one you already know there 's no question none that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes heart disease stroke some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world and that 's the direct result of eating a western diet our demand for meat dairy and refined carbohydrates -- the world consumes one billion cans or bottles of coke a day -- our demand for these things not our need our want drives us to consume way more calories than are good for us and those calories are in foods that cause not prevent disease now global warming was unforeseen we did n't know that pollution did more than cause bad visibility maybe a few lung diseases here and there but you know that 's not such a big deal the current health crisis however is a little more the work of the evil empire we were told we were assured that the more meat and dairy and poultry we ate the healthier we 'd be no overconsumption of animals and of course junk food is the problem along with our paltry consumption of plants now there 's no time to get into the benefits of eating plants here but the evidence is that plants -- and i want to make this clear -- it 's not the ingredients in plants it 's the plants it 's not the beta-carotene it 's the carrot the evidence is very clear that plants promote health this evidence is overwhelming at this point you eat more plants you eat less other stuff you live longer not bad but back to animals and junk food what do they have in common one : we do n't need either of them for health we do n't need animal products and we certainly do n't need white bread or coke two : both have been marketed heavily creating unnatural demand we 're not born craving whoppers or skittles three : their production has been supported by government agencies at the expense of a more health- and earth-friendly diet now let 's imagine a parallel let 's pretend that our government supported an oil-based economy while discouraging more sustainable forms of energy knowing all the while that the result would be pollution war and rising costs incredible is n't it yet they do that and they do this here it 's the same deal the sad thing is when it comes to diet is that even when well-intentioned feds try to do right by us they fail either they 're outvoted by puppets of agribusiness or they are puppets of agribusiness so when the usda finally acknowledged that it was plants rather than animals that made people healthy they encouraged us via their overly simplistic food pyramid to eat five servings of fruits and vegetables a day along with more carbs what they did n't tell us is that some carbs are better than others and that plants and whole grains should be supplanting eating junk food but industry lobbyists would never let that happen and guess what half the people who developed the food pyramid have ties to agribusiness so instead of substituting plants for animals our swollen appetites simply became larger and the most dangerous aspects of them remained unchanged so-called low-fat diets so-called low-carb diets -- these are not solutions but with lots of intelligent people focusing on whether food is organic or local or whether we 're being nice to animals the most important issues just are n't being addressed now do n't get me wrong i like animals and i do n't think it 's just fine to industrialize their production and to churn them out like they were wrenches but there 's no way to treat animals well when you 're killing 10 billion of them a year that 's our number 10 billion if you strung all of them -- chickens cows pigs and lambs -- to the moon they 'd go there and back five times there and back now my math 's a little shaky but this is pretty good and it depends whether a pig is four feet long or five feet long but you get the idea that 's just the united states and with our hyper-consumption of those animals producing greenhouse gases and heart disease kindness might just be a bit of a red herring let 's get the numbers of the animals we 're killing for eating down and then we 'll worry about being nice to the ones that are left another red herring might be exemplified by the word " locavore " which was just named word of the year by the new oxford american dictionary seriously and locavore for those of you who do n't know is someone who eats only locally grown food -- which is fine if you live in california but for the rest of us it 's a bit of a sad joke between the official story -- the food pyramid -- and the hip locavore vision you have two versions of how to improve our eating they both get it wrong though the first at least is populist and the second is elitist how we got to this place is the history of food in the united states and i 'm going to go through that at least the last hundred years or so very quickly right now a hundred years ago guess what everyone was a locavore : even new york had pig farms nearby and shipping food all over the place was a ridiculous notion every family had a cook usually a mom and those moms bought and prepared food it was like your romantic vision of europe margarine did n't exist in fact when margarine was invented several states passed laws declaring that it had to be dyed pink so we 'd all know that it was a fake there was no snack food and until the '20s until clarence birdseye came along there was no frozen food there were no restaurant chains there were neighborhood restaurants run by local people but none of them would think to open another one eating ethnic was unheard of unless you were ethnic and fancy food was entirely french as an aside those of you who remember dan aykroyd in the 1970s doing julia child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide back in those days before even julia back in those days there was no philosophy of food you just ate you did n't claim to be anything there was no marketing there were no national brands vitamins had not been invented there were no health claims at least not federally sanctioned ones fats carbs proteins -- they were n't bad or good they were food you ate food hardly anything contained more than one ingredient because it was an ingredient the cornflake had n't been invented the pop-tart the pringle cheez whiz none of that stuff goldfish swam it 's hard to imagine people grew food and they ate food and again everyone ate local in new york an orange was a common christmas present because it came all the way from florida from the '30s on road systems expanded trucks took the place of railroads fresh food began to travel more oranges became common in new york the south and west became agricultural hubs and in other parts of the country suburbs took over farmland the effects of this are well known they are everywhere and the death of family farms is part of this puzzle as is almost everything from the demise of the real community to the challenge of finding a good tomato even in summer eventually california produced too much food to ship fresh so it became critical to market canned and frozen foods thus arrived convenience it was sold to proto-feminist housewives as a way to cut down on housework now i know everybody over the age of like 45 -- their mouths are watering at this point if we had a slide of salisbury steak even more so right but this may have cut down on housework but it cut down on the variety of food we ate as well many of us grew up never eating a fresh vegetable except the occasional raw carrot or maybe an odd lettuce salad i for one -- and i 'm not kidding -- did n't eat real spinach or broccoli till i was 19 who needed it though meat was everywhere what could be easier more filling or healthier for your family than broiling a steak but by then cattle were already raised unnaturally rather than spending their lives eating grass for which their stomachs were designed they were forced to eat soy and corn they have trouble digesting those grains of course but that was n't a problem for producers new drugs kept them healthy well they kept them alive healthy was another story thanks to farm subsidies the fine collaboration between agribusiness and congress soy corn and cattle became king and chicken soon joined them on the throne it was during this period that the cycle of dietary and planetary destruction began the thing we 're only realizing just now listen to this between 1950 and 2000 the world 's population doubled meat consumption increased five-fold now someone had to eat all that stuff so we got fast food and this took care of the situation resoundingly home cooking remained the norm but its quality was down the tubes there were fewer meals with home-cooked breads desserts and soups because all of them could be bought at any store not that they were any good but they were there most moms cooked like mine : a piece of broiled meat a quickly made salad with bottled dressing canned soup canned fruit salad maybe baked or mashed potatoes or perhaps the stupidest food ever minute rice for dessert store-bought ice cream or cookies my mom is not here so i can say this now this kind of cooking drove me to learn how to cook for myself it was n't all bad by the '70s forward-thinking people began to recognize the value of local ingredients we tended gardens we became interested in organic food we knew or we were vegetarians we were n't all hippies either some of us were eating in good restaurants and learning how to cook well meanwhile food production had become industrial industrial perhaps because it was being produced rationally as if it were plastic food gained magical or poisonous powers or both many people became fat-phobic others worshiped broccoli as if it were god-like but mostly they did n't eat broccoli instead they were sold on yogurt yogurt being almost as good as broccoli except in reality the way the industry sold yogurt was to convert it to something much more akin to ice cream similarly let 's look at a granola bar you think that that might be healthy food but in fact if you look at the ingredient list it 's closer in form to a snickers than it is to oatmeal sadly it was at this time that the family dinner was put in a coma if not actually killed -- the beginning of the heyday of value-added food which contained as many soy and corn products as could be crammed into it think of the frozen chicken nugget the chicken is fed corn and then its meat is ground up and mixed with more corn products to add bulk and binder and then it 's fried in corn oil all you do is nuke it what could be better and zapped horribly pathetically by the '70s home cooking was in such a sad state that the high fat and spice contents of foods like mcnuggets and hot pockets -- and we all have our favorites actually -- made this stuff more appealing than the bland things that people were serving at home at the same time masses of women were entering the workforce and cooking simply was n't important enough for men to share the burden so now you 've got your pizza nights you 've got your microwave nights you 've got your grazing nights you 've got your fend-for-yourself nights and so on leading the way -- what 's leading the way meat junk food cheese : the very stuff that will kill you so now we clamor for organic food that 's good and as evidence that things can actually change you can now find organic food in supermarkets and even in fast-food outlets but organic food is n't the answer either at least not the way it 's currently defined let me pose you a question can farm-raised salmon be organic when its feed has nothing to do with its natural diet even if the feed itself is supposedly organic and the fish themselves are packed tightly in pens swimming in their own filth and if that salmon 's from chile and it 's killed down there and then flown 5,000 miles whatever dumping how much carbon into the atmosphere i do n't know packed in styrofoam of course before landing somewhere in the united states and then being trucked a few hundred more miles this may be organic in letter but it 's surely not organic in spirit now here is where we all meet the locavores the organivores the vegetarians the vegans the gourmets and those of us who are just plain interested in good food even though we 've come to this from different points we all have to act on our knowledge to change the way that everyone thinks about food we need to start acting and this is not only an issue of social justice as ann cooper said -- and of course she 's completely right -- but it 's also one of global survival which bring me full circle and points directly to the core issue the overproduction and overconsumption of meat and junk food as i said 18 percent of greenhouse gases are attributed to livestock production how much livestock do you need to produce this 70 percent of the agricultural land on earth 30 percent of the earth 's land surface is directly or indirectly devoted to raising the animals we 'll eat and this amount is predicted to double in the next 40 years or so and if the numbers coming in from china are anything like what they look like now it 's not going to be 40 years there is no good reason for eating as much meat as we do and i say this as a man who has eaten a fair share of corned beef in his life the most common argument is that we need nutrients -- even though we eat on average twice as much protein as even the industry-obsessed usda recommends but listen : experts who are serious about disease reduction recommend that adults eat just over half a pound of meat per week what do you think we eat per day half a pound but do n't we need meat to be big and strong is n't meat eating essential to health wo n't a diet heavy in fruit and vegetables turn us into godless sissy liberals some of us might think that would be a good thing but no even if we were all steroid-filled football players the answer is no in fact there 's no diet on earth that meets basic nutritional needs that wo n't promote growth and many will make you much healthier than ours does we do n't eat animal products for sufficient nutrition we eat them to have an odd form of malnutrition and it 's killing us to suggest that in the interests of personal and human health americans eat 50 percent less meat -- it 's not enough of a cut but it 's a start it would seem absurd but that 's exactly what should happen and what progressive people forward-thinking people should be doing and advocating along with the corresponding increase in the consumption of plants i 've been writing about food more or less omnivorously -- one might say indiscriminately -- for about 30 years during that time i 've eaten and recommended eating just about everything i 'll never stop eating animals i 'm sure but i do think that for the benefit of everyone the time has come to stop raising them industrially and stop eating them thoughtlessly ann cooper 's right the usda is not our ally here we have to take matters into our own hands not only by advocating for a better diet for everyone -- and that 's the hard part -- but by improving our own and that happens to be quite easy less meat less junk more plants it 's a simple formula : eat food eat real food we can continue to enjoy our food and we continue to eat well and we can eat even better we can continue the search for the ingredients we love and we can continue to spin yarns about our favorite meals we 'll reduce not only calories but our carbon footprint we can make food more important not less and save ourselves by doing so we have to choose that path thank you about a year ago i asked myself a question : " knowing what i know why am i not a vegetarian " after all i 'm one of the green guys : i grew up with hippie parents in a log cabin i started a site called treehugger -- i care about this stuff i knew that eating a mere hamburger a day can increase my risk of dying by a third cruelty : i knew that the 10 billion animals we raise each year for meat are raised in factory farm conditions that we hypocritically would n't even consider for our own cats dogs and other pets environmentally meat amazingly causes more emissions than all of transportation combined : cars trains planes buses boats all of it and beef production uses 100 times the water that most vegetables do i also knew that i 'm not alone we as a society are eating twice as much meat as we did in the 50s so what was once the special little side treat now is the main much more regular so really any of these angles should have been enough to convince me to go vegetarian yet there i was -- chk chk chk -- tucking into a big old steak so why was i stalling i realized that what i was being pitched was a binary solution it was either you 're a meat eater or you 're a vegetarian and i guess i just was n't quite ready imagine your last hamburger so my common sense my good intentions were in conflict with my taste buds and i 'd commit to doing it later and not surprisingly later never came sound familiar so i wondered might there be a third solution and i thought about it and i came up with one i 've been doing it for the last year and it 's great it 's called weekday veg the name says it all : nothing with a face monday through friday on the weekend your choice simple if you want to take it to the next level remember the major culprits in terms of environmental damage and health are red and processed meats so you want to swap those out with some good sustainably harvested fish it 's structured so it ends up being simple to remember and it 's okay to break it here and there after all cutting five days a week is cutting 70 percent of your meat intake the program has been great weekday veg my footprint 's smaller i 'm lessening pollution i feel better about the animals i 'm even saving money best of all i 'm healthier i know that i 'm going to live longer and i 've even lost a little weight so please ask yourselves for your health for your pocketbook for the environment for the animals : what 's stopping you from giving weekday veg a shot after all if all of us ate half as much meat it would be like half of us were vegetarians thank you in the next 18 minutes i 'm going to take you on a journey and it 's a journey that you and i have been on for many years now and it began some 50 years ago when humans first stepped off our planet and in those 50 years not only did we literally physically set foot on the moon but we have dispatched robotic spacecraft to all the planets -- all eight of them -- and we have landed on asteroids we have rendezvoused with comets and at this point in time we have a spacecraft on its way to pluto the body formerly known as a planet and all of these robotic missions are part of a bigger human journey : a voyage to understand something to get a sense of our cosmic place to understand something of our origins and how earth our planet and we living on it came to be and of all the places in the solar system that we might go to and search for answers to questions like this there 's saturn and we have been to saturn before -- we visited saturn in the early 1980s -- but our investigations of saturn have become far more in-depth in detail since the cassini spacecraft traveling across interplanetary space for seven years glided into orbit around saturn in the summer of 2004 and became at that point the farthest robotic outpost that humanity had ever established around the sun now the saturn system is a rich planetary system it offers mystery scientific insight and obviously splendor beyond compare and the investigation of this system has enormous cosmic reach in fact just studying the rings alone we stand to learn a lot about the discs of stars and gas that we call the spiral galaxies and here 's a beautiful picture of the andromeda nebula which is our closest largest spiral galaxy to the milky way and then here 's a beautiful composite of the whirlpool galaxy taken by the hubble space telescope so the journey back to saturn is really part of and is also a metaphor for a much larger human voyage to understand the interconnectedness of everything around us and also how humans fit into that picture and it pains me that i ca n't tell you all that we have learned with cassini i ca n't show you all the beautiful pictures that we 've taken in the last two and a half years because i simply do n't have the time so i 'm going to concentrate on two of the most exciting stories that have emerged out of this major exploratory expedition that we are conducting around saturn and have been for the past two and a half years saturn is accompanied by a very large and diverse collection of moons they range in size from a few kilometers across to as big across as the u.s most of the beautiful pictures we 've taken of saturn in fact show saturn in accompaniment with some of its moons here 's saturn with dione and then here 's saturn showing the rings edge-on showing you just how vertically thin they are with the moon enceladus now two of the 47 moons that saturn has are standouts and those are titan and enceladus titan is saturn 's largest moon and until cassini had arrived there was the largest single expanse of unexplored terrain that we had remaining in our solar system and it is a body that has long intrigued people who 've watched the planets it has a very large thick atmosphere and in fact its surface environment was believed to be more like the environment we have here on the earth or at least had in the past than any other body in the solar system its atmosphere is largely molecular nitrogen like you are breathing here in this room except that its atmosphere is suffused with simple organic materials like methane and propane and ethane and these molecules high up in the atmosphere of titan get broken down and their products join together to make haze particles this haze is ubiquitous it 's completely global and enveloping titan and that 's why you can not see down to the surface with our eyes in the visible region of the spectrum but these haze particles it was surmised before we got there with cassini over billions and billions of years gently drifted down to the surface and coated the surface in a thick organic sludge so like the equivalent the titan equivalent of tar or oil or what -- we did n't know what but this is what we suspected and these molecules especially methane and ethane can be liquids at the surface temperatures of titan and so it turns out that methane is to titan what water is to the earth it 's a condensable in the atmosphere and so recognizing this circumstance brought to the fore a whole world of bizarre possibilities you can have methane clouds ok and above those clouds you have this hundreds of kilometers of haze which prevent any sunlight from getting to the surface the temperature at the surface is some 350 degrees below zero fahrenheit but despite that cold you could have rain falling down on the surface of titan and doing on titan what rain does on the earth : it carves gullies ; it forms rivers and cataracts ; it can create canyons ; it can pool in large basins and craters it can wash the sludge off high mountain peaks and hills down into the lowlands so stop and think for a minute try to imagine what the surface of titan might look like it 's dark high noon on titan is as dark as deep earth twilight on the earth it 's cold it 's eerie it 's misty it might be raining and you might be standing on the shores of lake michigan brimming with paint thinner that is the view that we had of the surface of titan before we got there with cassini and i can tell you that what we have found on titan though it is not the same in detail is every bit as fascinating as that story is and for us it has been like -- the cassini people -- it has been like a jules verne adventure come true as i said it has a thick extensive atmosphere this is a picture of titan backlit by the sun with the rings as a beautiful backdrop and yet another moon there -- i do n't even know which one it is it 's a very extensive atmosphere we have instruments on cassini which can see down to the surface through this atmosphere and my camera system is one of them and we have taken pictures like this and what you see is bright and dark regions and that 's about as far as it got for us it was so mystifying : we could n't make out what we were seeing on titan when you look closer at this region you start to see things like sinuous channels -- we did n't know you see a few round things this we later found out is in fact a crater but there are very few craters on the surface of titan meaning it 's a very young surface and there are features that look tectonic they look like they 've been pulled apart whenever you see anything linear on a planet it means there 's been a fracture like a fault and so it 's been tectonically altered but we could n't make sense of our images until six months after we got into orbit an event occurred that many have regarded as the highlight of cassini 's investigation of titan and that was the deployment of the huygens probe the european-built huygens probe that cassini had carried for seven years across the solar system we deployed it to the atmosphere of titan it took two and a half hours to descend and it landed on the surface and i just want to emphasize how significant an event this is this is a device of human making and it landed in the outer solar system for the first time in human history it is so significant that in my mind this was an event that should have been celebrated with ticker tape parades in every city across the u.s. and europe and sadly that was n't the case it was significant for another reason this is an international mission and this event was celebrated in europe in germany and the celebratory presentations were given in english accents and american accents and german accents and french and italian and dutch accents it was a moving demonstration of what the words " united nations " are supposed to mean : a true union of nations joined together in a colossal effort for good and in this case it was a massive undertaking to explore a planet and to come to understand a planetary system that for all of human history had been unreachable and now humans had actually touched it so it was -- i mean i 'm getting goose bumps just talking about it it was a tremendously emotional event and it 's something that i will personally never forget and you should n't either but anyway the probe took measurements of the atmosphere on the way down and it also took panoramic pictures and i ca n't tell you what it was like to see the first pictures of titan 's surface from the probe and this is what we saw and it was a shocker because it was everything we wanted those other pictures taken from orbit to be it was an unambiguous pattern a geological pattern it 's a dendritic drainage pattern that can be formed only by the flow of liquids and you can follow these channels and you can see how they all converge and they converge into this channel here which drains into this region you are looking at a shoreline was this a shoreline of fluids we did n't know but this is somewhat of a shoreline this picture is taken at 16 kilometers this is the picture taken at eight kilometers ok again the shoreline okay now 16 kilometers eight kilometers -- this is roughly an airline altitude if you were going to take an airplane trip across the u.s. you would be flying at these altitudes so this is the picture you would have at the window of titanian airlines as you fly across the surface of titan and then finally the probe came to rest on the surface and i 'm going to show you ladies and gentlemen the first picture ever taken from the surface of a moon in the outer solar system and here is the horizon ok these are probably water ice pebbles yes and obviously it landed in one of these flat dark regions and it did n't sink out of sight so it was n't fluid that we landed in what the probe came down in was basically the titan equivalent of a mud flat this is an unconsolidated ground that is suffused with liquid methane and it 's probably the case that this material has washed off the highlands of titan through these channels that we saw and has drained over billions of years to fill in low-lying basins and that is what the huygens probe landed in but still there was no sign in our images or even in the huygens ' images of any large open bodies of fluids where were they it got even more puzzling when we found dunes ok so this is our movie of the equatorial region of titan showing these dunes these are dunes that are 100 meters tall separated by a few kilometers and they go on for miles and miles and miles there 's hundreds up to a 1,000 or 1,200 miles of dunes this is the saharan desert of titan it 's obviously a place which is very dry or you would n't get dunes so again it got puzzling that there were no bodies of fluid until finally we saw lakes in the polar regions and there is a lake scene in the south polar region of titan it 's about the size of lake ontario and then only a week and a half ago we flew over the north pole of titan and found again we found a feature here the size of the caspian sea so it seems that the liquids for some reason we do n't understand or during at least this season are apparently at the poles of titan and i think you would agree that we have found titan is a remarkable mystical place it 's exotic it 's alien but yet strangely earth-like and having earth-like geological formations and a tremendous geographical diversity and is a fascinating world whose only rival in the solar system for complexity and richness is the earth itself and so now we go onto enceladus enceladus is a small moon it 's about a tenth the size of titan and you can see it here next to england just to show you the size this is not meant to be a threat and enceladus is very white it 's very bright and its surface is obviously wrecked with fractures it is a very geologically active body but the mother lode of discoveries on enceladus was found at the south pole -- and we 're looking at the south pole here -- where we found this system of fractures and they 're a different color because they 're a different composition they are coated these fractures are coated with organic materials moreover this whole entire region the south polar region has elevated temperatures it 's the hottest place on the planet on the body that 's as bizarre as finding that the antarctic on the earth is hotter than the tropics and then when we took additional pictures we discovered that from these fractures are issuing jets of fine icy particles extending hundreds of miles into space and when we color-code this image to bring out the faint light levels we see that these jets feed a plume that in fact we see in other images goes thousands of miles into the space above enceladus my team and i have examined images like this and like this one and have thought about the other results from cassini and we have arrived at the conclusion that these jets may be erupting from pockets of liquid water under the surface of enceladus so we have possibly liquid water organic materials and excess heat in other words we have possibly stumbled upon the holy grail of modern day planetary exploration or in other words an environment that is potentially suitable for living organisms and i do n't think i need to tell you that the discovery of life elsewhere in our solar system whether it be on enceladus or elsewhere would have enormous cultural and scientific implications because if we could demonstrate that genesis had occurred not once but twice independently in our solar system then that means by inference it has occurred a staggering number of times throughout the universe and its 13.7 billion year history right now earth is the only planet still that we know is teeming with life it is precious it is unique it is still so far the only home we 've ever known and if any of you were alert and coherent during the 1960s -- and we 'd forgive you if you were n't ok -- you would remember this very famous picture taken by the apollo 8 astronauts in 1968 it was the first time that earth was imaged from space and it had an enormous impact on our sense of place in the universe and our sense of responsibility for the protection of our own planet well we on cassini have taken an equivalent first a picture that no human eye has ever seen before it is a total eclipse of the sun seen from the other side of saturn and in this impossibly beautiful picture you see the main rings backlit by the sun you see the refracted image of the sun and you see this ring created in fact by the exhalations of enceladus but as if that were n't brilliant enough we can spot in this beautiful image sight of our own planet cradled in the arms of saturn 's rings now there is something deeply moving about seeing ourselves from afar and capturing the sight of our little blue-ocean planet in the skies of other worlds and that and the perspective of ourselves that we gain from that may be in the end the finest reward that we earn from this journey of discovery that started half a century ago and thank you very much we are drowning in news reuters alone puts out three and a half million news stories a year that 's just one source my question is : how many of those stories are actually going to matter in the long run that 's the idea behind the long news it 's a project by the long now foundation which was founded by tedsters including kevin kelly and stewart brand and what we 're looking for is news stories that might still matter 50 or 100 or 10,000 years from now and when you look at the news through that filter a lot falls by the wayside to take the top stories from the a.p this last year is this going to matter in a decade or this or this really is this going to matter in 50 or 100 years okay that was kind of cool but the top story of this past year was the economy and i 'm just betting that sooner or later this particular recession is going to be old news so what kind of stories might make a difference for the future well let 's take science someday little robots will go through our bloodstreams fixing things that someday is already here if you 're a mouse some recent stories : nanobees zap tumors with real bee venom ; they 're sending genes into the brain ; a robot they built that can crawl through the human body what about resources how are we going to feed nine billion people we 're having trouble feeding six billion today as we heard yesterday there 's over a billion people hungry britain will starve without genetically modified crops bill gates fortunately has bet a billion on [ agricultural ] research what about global politics the world 's going to be very different when and if china sets the agenda and they may they 've overtaken the u.s. as the world 's biggest car market they 've overtaken germany as the largest exporter and they 've started doing dna tests on kids to choose their careers we 're finding all kinds of ways to push back the limits of what we know some recent discoveries : there 's an ant colony from argentina that has now spread to every continent but antarctica ; there 's a self-directed robot scientist that 's made a discovery -- soon science may no longer need us and life may no longer need us either ; a microbe wakes up after 120,000 years it seems that with or without us life will go on but my pick for the top long news story of this past year was this one : water found on the moon makes it a lot easier to put a colony up there and if nasa does n't do it china might or somebody in this room might write a big check my point is this : in the long run some news stories are more important than others i 'm a filmmaker for the last 8 years i have dedicated my life to documenting the work of israelis and palestinians who are trying to end the conflict using peaceful means when i travel with my work across europe and the united states one question always comes up : where is the palestinian gandhi why are n't palestinians using nonviolent resistance the challenge i face when i hear this question is that often i have just returned from the middle east where i spent my time filming dozens of palestinians who are using nonviolence to defend their lands and water resources from israeli soldiers and settlers these leaders are trying to forge a massive national nonviolent movement to end the occupation and build peace in the region yet most of you have probably never heard about them this divide between what 's happening on the ground and perceptions abroad is one of the key reasons why we do n't have yet a palestinian peaceful resistance movement that has been successful so i 'm here today to talk about the power of attention the power of your attention and the emergence and development of nonviolent movements in the west bank gaza and elsewhere -- but today my case study is going to be palestine i believe that what 's mostly missing for nonviolence to grow is not for palestinians to start adopting nonviolence but for us to start paying attention to those who already are allow me to illustrate this point by taking you to this village called budrus about seven years ago they faced extinction because israel announced it would build a separation barrier and part of this barrier would be built on top of the village they would lose 40 percent of their land and be surrounded so they would lose free access to the rest of the west bank through inspired local leadership they launched a peaceful resistance campaign to stop that from happening let me show you some brief clips so you have a sense for what that actually looked like on the ground palestinian woman : we were told the wall would separate palestine from israel here in budrus we realized the wall would steal our land israeli man : the fence has in fact created a solution to terror man : today you 're invited to a peaceful march you are joined by dozens of your israeli brothers and sisters israeli activist : nothing scares the army more than nonviolent opposition woman : we saw the men trying to push the soldiers but none of them could do that but i think the girls could do it fatah party member : we must empty our minds of traditional thinking hamas party member : we were in complete harmony and we wanted to spread it to all of palestine chanting : one united nation fatah hamas and the popular front ! news anchor : the clashes over the fence continue reporter : israeli border police were sent to disperse the crowd they were allowed to use any force necessary man : these are live bullets it 's like fallujah shooting everywhere israeli activist : i was sure we were all going to die but there were others around me who were n't even cowering israeli soldier : a nonviolent protest is not going to stop the [ unclear ] protester : this is a peaceful march there is no need to use violence chanting : we can do it ! we can do it ! we can do it ! julia bacha : when i first heard about the story of budrus i was surprised that the international media had failed to cover the extraordinary set of events that happened seven years ago in 2003 what was even more surprising was the fact that budrus was successful the residents after 10 months of peaceful resistance convinced the israeli government to move the route of the barrier off their lands and to the green line which is the internationally recognized boundary between israel and the palestinian territories the resistance in budrus has since spread to villages across the west bank and to palestinian neighborhoods in jerusalem yet the media remains mostly silent on these stories this silence carries profound consequences for the likelihood that nonviolence can grow or even survive in palestine violent resistance and nonviolent resistance share one very important thing in common ; they are both a form of theater seeking an audience to their cause if violent actors are the only ones constantly getting front-page covers and attracting international attention to the palestinian issue it becomes very hard for nonviolent leaders to make the case to their communities that civil disobedience is a viable option in addressing their plight the power of attention is probably going to come as no surprise to the parents in the room the surest way to make your child throw increasingly louder tantrums is by giving him attention the first time he throws a fit the tantrum will become what childhood psychologists call a functional behavior since the child has learned that he can get parental attention out of it parents can incentivize or disincentivize behavior simply by giving or withdrawing attention to their children but that 's true for adults too in fact the behavior of entire communities and countries can be influenced depending on where the international community chooses to focus its attention i believe that at the core of ending the conflict in the middle east and bringing peace is for us to transform nonviolence into a functional behavior by giving a lot more attention to the nonviolent leaders on the ground today in the course of taking my film to villages in the west bank in gaza and in east jerusalem i have seen the impact that even one documentary film can have in influencing the transformation in a village called wallajeh which sits very close to jerusalem the community was facing a very similar plight to budrus they were going to be surrounded lose a lot of their lands and not have freedom of access either to the west bank or jerusalem they had been using nonviolence for about two years but had grown disenchanted since nobody was paying attention so we organized a screening a week later they held the most well-attended and disciplined demonstration to date the organizers say that the villagers upon seeing the story of budrus documented in a film felt that there were indeed people following what they were doing that people cared so they kept on going on the israeli side there is a new peace movement called solidariot which means solidarity in hebrew the leaders of this movement have been using budrus as one of their primary recruiting tools they report that israelis who had never been active before upon seeing the film understand the power of nonviolence and start joining their activities the examples of wallajeh and the solidariot movement show that even a small-budget independent film can play a role in transforming nonviolence into a functional behavior now imagine the power that big media players could have if they started covering the weekly nonviolent demonstrations happening in villages like bil'in ni'lin wallajeh in jerusalem neighborhoods like sheikh jarrah and silwan -- the nonviolent leaders would become more visible valued and effective in their work i believe that the most important thing is to understand that if we do n't pay attention to these efforts they are invisible and it 's as if they never happened but i have seen first hand that if we do they will multiply if they multiply their influence will grow in the overall israeli-palestinian conflict and theirs is the kind of influence that can finally unblock the situation these leaders have proven that nonviolence works in places like budrus let 's give them attention so they can prove it works everywhere thank you in 2008 cyclone nargis devastated myanmar millions of people were in severe need of help the u.n. wanted to rush people and supplies to the area but there were no maps no maps of roads no maps showing hospitals no way for help to reach the cyclone victims when we look at a map of los angeles or london it is hard to believe that as of 2005 only 15 percent of the world was mapped to a geo-codable level of detail the u.n. ran headfirst into a problem that the majority of the world 's populous faces : not having detailed maps but help was coming at google 40 volunteers used a new software to map 120,000 kilometers of roads 3,000 hospitals logistics and relief points and it took them four days the new software they used google mapmaker google mapmaker is a technology that empowers each of us to map what we know locally people have used this software to map everything from roads to rivers from schools to local businesses and video stores to the corner store maps matter nobel prize nominee hernando de soto recognized that the key to economic liftoff for most developing countries is to tap the vast amounts of uncapitalized land for example a trillion dollars of real estate remains uncapitalized in india alone in the last year alone thousands of users in 170 countries have mapped millions of pieces of information and created a map of a level of detail never thought viable and this was made possible by the power of passionate users everywhere let 's look at some of the maps being created by users right now so as we speak people are mapping the world in these 170 countries you can see bridget in africa who just mapped a road in senegal and closer to home chalua an n.g road in bangalore this is the result of computational geometry gesture recognition and machine learning this is a victory of thousands of users in hundreds of cities one user one edit at a time this is an invitation to the 70 percent of our unmapped planet welcome to the new world when we park in a big parking lot how do we remember where we parked our car here 's the problem facing homer and we 're going to try to understand what 's happening in his brain so we 'll start with the hippocampus shown in yellow which is the organ of memory if you have damage there like in alzheimer 's you ca n't remember things including where you parked your car it 's named after latin for " seahorse " which it resembles and like the rest of the brain it 's made of neurons so the human brain has about a hundred billion neurons in it and the neurons communicate with each other by sending little pulses or spikes of electricity via connections to each other the hippocampus is formed of two sheets of cells which are very densely interconnected and scientists have begun to understand how spatial memory works by recording from individual neurons in rats or mice while they forage or explore an environment looking for food so we 're going to imagine we 're recording from a single neuron in the hippocampus of this rat here and when it fires a little spike of electricity there 's going to be a red dot and a click so what we see is that this neuron knows whenever the rat has gone into one particular place in its environment and it signals to the rest of the brain by sending a little electrical spike so we could show the firing rate of that neuron as a function of the animal 's location and if we record from lots of different neurons we 'll see that different neurons fire when the animal goes in different parts of its environment like in this square box shown here so together they form a map for the rest of the brain telling the brain continually " where am i now within my environment " place cells are also being recorded in humans so epilepsy patients sometimes need the electrical activity in their brain monitoring and some of these patients played a video game where they drive around a small town and place cells in their hippocampi would fire become active start sending electrical impulses whenever they drove through a particular location in that town so how does a place cell know where the rat or person is within its environment well these two cells here show us that the boundaries of the environment are particularly important so the one on the top likes to fire sort of midway between the walls of the box that their rat 's in and when you expand the box the firing location expands the one below likes to fire whenever there 's a wall close by to the south and if you put another wall inside the box then the cell fires in both place wherever there 's a wall to the south as the animal explores around in its box that sensing the distances and directions of boundaries around you -- extended buildings and so on -- is particularly important for the hippocampus and indeed on the inputs to the hippocampus cells are found which project into the hippocampus which do respond exactly to detecting boundaries or edges at particular distances and directions from the rat or mouse as it 's exploring around so the cell on the left you can see it fires whenever the animal gets near to a wall or a boundary to the east whether it 's the edge or the wall of a square box or the circular wall of the circular box or even the drop at the edge of a table which the animals are running around and the cell on the right there fires whenever there 's a boundary to the south whether it 's the drop at the edge of the table or a wall or even the gap between two tables that are pulled apart so that 's one way in which we think place cells determine where the animal is as it 's exploring around we can also test where we think objects are like this goal flag in simple environments -- or indeed where your car would be so we can have people explore an environment and see the location they have to remember and then if we put them back in the environment generally they 're quite good at putting a marker down where they thought that flag or their car was but on some trials we could change the shape and size of the environment like we did with the place cell in that case we can see how where they think the flag had been changes as a function of how you change the shape and size of the environment and what you see for example if the flag was where that cross was in a small square environment and then if you ask people where it was but you 've made the environment bigger where they think the flag had been stretches out in exactly the same way that the place cell firing stretched out it 's as if you remember where the flag was by storing the pattern of firing across all of your place cells at that location and then you can get back to that location so that you best match the current pattern of firing of your place cells with that stored pattern that guides you back to the location that you want to remember but we also know where we are through movement so if we take some outbound path -- perhaps we park and we wander off -- we know because our own movements which we can integrate over this path roughly what the heading direction is to go back and place cells also get this kind of path integration input from a kind of cell called a grid cell now grid cells are found again on the inputs to the hippocampus and they 're a bit like place cells but now as the rat explores around each individual cell fires in a whole array of different locations which are laid out across the environment in an amazingly regular triangular grid and if you record from several grid cells -- shown here in different colors -- each one has a grid-like firing pattern across the environment and each cell 's grid-like firing pattern is shifted slightly relative to the other cells so the red one fires on this grid and the green one on this one and the blue on on this one so together it 's as if the rat can put a virtual grid of firing locations across its environment -- a bit like the latitude and longitude lines that you 'd find on a map but using triangles and as it moves around the electrical activity can pass from one of these cells to the next cell to keep track of where it is so that it can use its own movements to know where it is in its environment do people have grid cells well because all of the grid-like firing patterns have the same axes of symmetry the same orientations of grid shown in orange here it means that the net activity of all of the grid cells in a particular part of the brain should change according to whether we 're running along these six directions or running along one of the six directions in between so we can put people in an mri scanner and have them do a little video game like the one i showed you and look for this signal and indeed you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats so back to homer he 's probably remembering where his car was in terms of the distances and directions to extended buildings and boundaries around the location where he parked and that would be represented by the firing of boundary-detecting cells he 's also remembering the path he took out of the car park which would be represented in the firing of grid cells now both of these kinds of cells can make the place cells fire and he can return to the location where he parked by moving so as to find where it is that best matches the firing pattern of the place cells in his brain currently with the stored pattern where he parked his car and that guides him back to that location irrespective of visual cues like whether his car 's actually there maybe it 's been towed but he knows where it was so he knows to go and get it so beyond spatial memory if we look for this grid-like firing pattern throughout the whole brain we see it in a whole series of locations which are always active when we do all kinds of autobiographical memory tasks like remembering the last time you went to a wedding for example so it may be that the neural mechanisms for representing the space around us are also used for generating visual imagery so that we can recreate the spatial scene at least of the events that have happened to us when we want to imagine them so if this was happening your memories could start by place cells activating each other via these dense interconnections and then reactivating boundary cells to create the spatial structure of the scene around your viewpoint and grid cells could move this viewpoint through that space another kind of cell head direction cells which i did n't mention yet they fire like a compass according to which way you 're facing they could define the viewing direction from which you want to generate an image for your visual imagery so you can imagine what happened when you were at this wedding for example so this is just one example of a new era really in cognitive neuroscience where we 're beginning to understand psychological processes like how you remember or imagine or even think in terms of the actions of the billions of individual neurons that make up our brains thank you very much how do you explain when things do n't go as we assume or better how do you explain when others are able to achieve things that seem to defy all of the assumptions for example : why is apple so innovative year after year after year after year they 're more innovative than all their competition and yet they 're just a computer company they 're just like everyone else they have the same access to the same talent the same agencies the same consultants the same media then why is it that they seem to have something different why is it that martin luther king led the civil rights movement he was n't the only man who suffered in a pre-civil rights america and he certainly was n't the only great orator of the day why him and why is it that the wright brothers were able to figure out controlled powered man flight when there were certainly other teams who were better qualified better funded â€¦ and they did n't achieve powered man flight and the wright brothers beat them to it there 's something else at play here about three and a half years ago i made a discovery and this discovery profoundly changed my view on how i thought the world worked and it even profoundly changed the way in which i operate in it as it turns out there 's a pattern as it turns out all the great and inspiring leaders and organizations in the world -- whether it 's apple or martin luther king or the wright brothers -- they all think act and communicate the exact same way and it 's the complete opposite to everyone else all i did was codify it and it 's probably the world 's simplest idea i call it the golden circle why how what this little idea explains why some organizations and some leaders are able to inspire where others are n't let me define the terms really quickly every single person every single organization on the planet knows what they do 100 percent some know how they do it whether you call it your differentiated value proposition or your proprietary process or your usp but very very few people or organizations know why they do what they do and by " why " i do n't mean " to make a profit " that 's a result it 's always a result by " why " i mean : what 's your purpose what 's your cause what 's your belief why does your organization exist why do you get out of bed in the morning and why should anyone care well as a result the way we think the way we act the way we communicate is from the outside in it 's obvious we go from the clearest thing to the fuzziest thing but the inspired leaders and the inspired organizations -- regardless of their size regardless of their industry -- all think act and communicate from the inside out let me give you an example i use apple because they 're easy to understand and everybody gets it if apple were like everyone else a marketing message from them might sound like this : " we make great computers they 're beautifully designed simple to use and user friendly want to buy one " " meh " and that 's how most of us communicate that 's how most marketing is done that 's how most sales is done and that 's how most of us communicate interpersonally we say what we do we say how we 're different or how we 're better and we expect some sort of a behavior a purchase a vote something like that here 's our new law firm : we have the best lawyers with the biggest clients we always perform for our clients who do business with us here 's our new car : it gets great gas mileage it has leather seats buy our car but it 's uninspiring here 's how apple actually communicates " everything we do we believe in challenging the status quo we believe in thinking differently the way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed simple to use and user friendly we just happen to make great computers want to buy one " totally different right you 're ready to buy a computer from me all i did was reverse the order of the information what it proves to us is that people do n't buy what you do ; people buy why you do it people do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it this explains why every single person in this room is perfectly comfortable buying a computer from apple but we 're also perfectly comfortable buying an mp3 player from apple or a phone from apple or a dvr from apple but as i said before apple 's just a computer company there 's nothing that distinguishes them structurally from any of their competitors their competitors are all equally qualified to make all of these products in fact they tried a few years ago gateway came out with flat screen tvs they 're eminently qualified to make flat screen tvs they 've been making flat screen monitors for years nobody bought one dell came out with mp3 players and pdas and they make great quality products and they can make perfectly well-designed products -- and nobody bought one in fact talking about it now we ca n't even imagine buying an mp3 player from dell why would you buy an mp3 player from a computer company but we do it every day people do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it the goal is not to do business with everybody who needs what you have the goal is to do business with people who believe what you believe here 's the best part : none of what i 'm telling you is my opinion it 's all grounded in the tenets of biology not psychology biology if you look at a cross-section of the human brain looking from the top down what you see is the human brain is actually broken into three major components that correlate perfectly with the golden circle our newest brain our homo sapien brain our neocortex corresponds with the " what " level the neocortex is responsible for all of our rational and analytical thought and language the middle two sections make up our limbic brains and our limbic brains are responsible for all of our feelings like trust and loyalty it 's also responsible for all human behavior all decision-making and it has no capacity for language in other words when we communicate from the outside in yes people can understand vast amounts of complicated information like features and benefits and facts and figures it just does n't drive behavior when we can communicate from the inside out we 're talking directly to the part of the brain that controls behavior and then we allow people to rationalize it with the tangible things we say and do this is where gut decisions come from you know sometimes you can give somebody all the facts and figures and they say " i know what all the facts and details say but it just does n't feel right " why would we use that verb it does n't " feel " right because the part of the brain that controls decision-making does n't control language and the best we can muster up is " i do n't know it just does n't feel right " or sometimes you say you 're leading with your heart or you 're leading with your soul well i hate to break it to you those are n't other body parts controlling your behavior it 's all happening here in your limbic brain the part of the brain that controls decision-making and not language but if you do n't know why you do what you do and people respond to why you do what you do then how will you ever get people to vote for you or buy something from you or more importantly be loyal and want to be a part of what it is that you do again the goal is not just to sell to people who need what you have ; the goal is to sell to people who believe what you believe the goal is not just to hire people who need a job ; it 's to hire people who believe what you believe i always say that you know if you hire people just because they can do a job they 'll work for your money but if you hire people who believe what you believe they 'll work for you with blood and sweat and tears and nowhere else is there a better example of this than with the wright brothers most people do n't know about samuel pierpont langley and back in the early 20th century the pursuit of powered man flight was like the dot com of the day everybody was trying it and samuel pierpont langley had what we assume to be the recipe for success i mean even now you ask people " why did your product or why did your company fail " and people always give you the same permutation of the same three things : under-capitalized the wrong people bad market conditions it 's always the same three things so let 's explore that samuel pierpont langley was given 50,000 dollars by the war department to figure out this flying machine money was no problem he held a seat at harvard and worked at the smithsonian and was extremely well-connected ; he knew all the big minds of the day he hired the best minds money could find and the market conditions were fantastic the new york times followed him around everywhere and everyone was rooting for langley then how come we 've never heard of samuel pierpont langley a few hundred miles away in dayton ohio orville and wilbur wright they had none of what we consider to be the recipe for success they had no money ; they paid for their dream with the proceeds from their bicycle shop ; not a single person on the wright brothers ' team had a college education not even orville or wilbur ; and the new york times followed them around nowhere the difference was orville and wilbur were driven by a cause by a purpose by a belief they believed that if they could figure out this flying machine it 'll change the course of the world samuel pierpont langley was different he wanted to be rich and he wanted to be famous he was in pursuit of the result he was in pursuit of the riches and lo and behold look what happened the people who believed in the wright brothers ' dream worked with them with blood and sweat and tears the others just worked for the paycheck and they tell stories of how every time the wright brothers went out they would have to take five sets of parts because that 's how many times they would crash before they came in for supper and eventually on december 17th 1903 the wright brothers took flight and no one was there to even experience it we found out about it a few days later and further proof that langley was motivated by the wrong thing : the day the wright brothers took flight he quit he could have said " that 's an amazing discovery guys and i will improve upon your technology " but he did n't he was n't first he did n't get rich he did n't get famous so he quit people do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it and if you talk about what you believe you will attract those who believe what you believe but why is it important to attract those who believe what you believe something called the law of diffusion of innovation and if you do n't know the law you definitely know the terminology the first two and a half percent of our population are our innovators the next 13 and a half percent of our population are our early adopters the next 34 percent are your early majority your late majority and your laggards the only reason these people buy touch tone phones is because you ca n't buy rotary phones anymore we all sit at various places at various times on this scale but what the law of diffusion of innovation tells us is that if you want mass-market success or mass-market acceptance of an idea you can not have it until you achieve this tipping point between 15 and 18 percent market penetration and then the system tips and i love asking businesses " what 's your conversion on new business " and they love to tell you " oh it 's about 10 percent " proudly well you can trip over 10 percent of the customers we all have about 10 percent who just " get it " that 's how we describe them right that 's like that gut feeling " oh they just get it " the problem is : how do you find the ones that get it before you 're doing business with them versus the ones who do n't get it so it 's this here this little gap that you have to close as jeffrey moore calls it " crossing the chasm " -- because you see the early majority will not try something until someone else has tried it first and these guys the innovators and the early adopters they 're comfortable making those gut decisions they 're more comfortable making those intuitive decisions that are driven by what they believe about the world and not just what product is available these are the people who stood in line for six hours to buy an iphone when they first came out when you could have just walked into the store the next week and bought one off the shelf these are the people who spent 40,000 dollars on flat screen tvs when they first came out even though the technology was substandard and by the way they did n't do it because the technology was so great ; they did it for themselves it 's because they wanted to be first people do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it and what you do simply proves what you believe in fact people will do the things that prove what they believe the reason that person bought the iphone in the first six hours stood in line for six hours was because of what they believed about the world and how they wanted everybody to see them : they were first people do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it so let me give you a famous example a famous failure and a famous success of the law of diffusion of innovation first the famous failure it 's a commercial example as we said before a second ago the recipe for success is money and the right people and the right market conditions right you should have success then look at tivo from the time tivo came out about eight or nine years ago to this current day they are the single highest-quality product on the market hands down there is no dispute they were extremely well-funded market conditions were fantastic i mean we use tivo as verb i tivo stuff on my piece of junk time warner dvr all the time but tivo 's a commercial failure they 've never made money and when they went ipo their stock was at about 30 or 40 dollars and then plummeted and it 's never traded above 10 in fact i do n't think it 's even traded above six except for a couple of little spikes because you see when tivo launched their product they told us all what they had they said " we have a product that pauses live tv skips commercials rewinds live tv and memorizes your viewing habits without you even asking " and the cynical majority said " we do n't believe you we do n't need it we do n't like it you 're scaring us " what if they had said " if you 're the kind of person who likes to have total control over every aspect of your life boy do we have a product for you it pauses live tv skips commercials memorizes your viewing habits etc. etc " people do n't buy what you do ; they buy why you do it and what you do simply serves as the proof of what you believe now let me give you a successful example of the law of diffusion of innovation in the summer of 1963 250,000 people showed up on the mall in washington to hear dr. king speak they sent out no invitations and there was no website to check the date how do you do that well dr. king was n't the only man in america who was a great orator he was n't the only man in america who suffered in a pre-civil rights america in fact some of his ideas were bad but he had a gift he did n't go around telling people what needed to change in america he went around and told people what he believed " i believe i believe i believe " he told people and people who believed what he believed took his cause and they made it their own and they told people and some of those people created structures to get the word out to even more people and lo and behold 250,000 people showed up on the right day at the right time to hear him speak how many of them showed up for him zero they showed up for themselves it 's what they believed about america that got them to travel in a bus for eight hours to stand in the sun in washington in the middle of august it 's what they believed and it was n't about black versus white : 25 percent of the audience was white dr. king believed that there are two types of laws in this world : those that are made by a higher authority and those that are made by man and not until all the laws that are made by man are consistent with the laws that are made by the higher authority will we live in a just world it just so happened that the civil rights movement was the perfect thing to help him bring his cause to life we followed not for him but for ourselves and by the way he gave the " i have a dream " speech not the " i have a plan " speech listen to politicians now with their comprehensive 12-point plans they 're not inspiring anybody because there are leaders and there are those who lead leaders hold a position of power or authority but those who lead inspire us whether they 're individuals or organizations we follow those who lead not because we have to but because we want to we follow those who lead not for them but for ourselves and it 's those who start with " why " that have the ability to inspire those around them or find others who inspire them thank you very much john hockenberry : it 's great to be here with you tom and i want to start with a question that has just been consuming me since i first became familiar with your work in you work there 's always this kind of hybrid quality of a natural force in some sort of interplay with creative force are they ever in equilibrium in the way that you see your work tom shannon : yeah the subject matter that i 'm looking for it 's usually to solve a question i had the question popped into my head : what does the cone that connects the sun and the earth look like if you could connect the two spheres and in proportion what would the size of the sphere and the length and what would the taper be to the earth and so i went about and made that sculpture turning it out of solid bronze and i did one that was about 35 feet long the sun end was about four inches in diameter and then it tapered over about 35 feet to about a millimeter at the earth end and so for me it was really exciting just to see what it looks like if you could step outside and into a larger context as though you were an astronaut and see these two things as an object because they are so intimately bound and one is meaningless without the other jh : is there a relief in playing with these forces and i 'm wondering how much of a sense of discovery there is in playing with these forces ts : well like the magnetically levitated objects -- like that silver one there that was the result of hundreds of experiments with magnets trying to find a way to make something float with the least possible connection to the ground so i got it down to just one tether to be able to support that jh : now is this electromagnetic here or are these static ts : those are permanent magnets yeah jh : because if the power went out there would just be a big noise ts : yeah it 's really unsatisfactory having plug-in art jh : i agree ts : the magnetic works are a combination of gravity and magnetism so it 's a kind of mixture of these ambient forces that influence everything the sun has a tremendous field that extends way beyond the planets and the earth 's magnetic field protects us from the sun so there 's this huge invisible shape structures that magnetism takes in the universe but with the pendulum it allows me to manifest these invisible forces that are holding the magnets up my sculptures are normally very simplified i try to refine them down to very simple forms but the paintings become very complex because i think the fields that are supporting them they 're billowing and they 're interpenetrating and they 're interference patterns jh : and they 're non-deterministic i mean you do n't know necessarily where you 're headed when you begin even though the forces can be calculated so the evolution of this -- i gather this is n't your first pendulum ts : no ts : the first one i did was in the late 70 's and i just had a simple cone with a spigot at the bottom of it i threw it into an orbit and it only had one color and when it got to the center the paint kept running out so i had to run in there did n't have any control over the spigot remotely so that told me right away : i need a remote control device but then i started dreaming of having six colors i sort of think about it as the dna -- these colors the red blue yellow the primary colors and white and black and if you put them together in different combinations -- just like printing in a sense like how a magazine color is printed -- and put them under certain forces which is orbiting them or passing them back and forth or drawing with them these amazing things started appearing jh : it looks like we 're loaded for bear here ts : yeah well let 's put a couple of canvases i 'll ask a couple of my sons to set up the canvases here i want to just say -- so this is jack nick and louie jh : thanks guys ts : so here are the -- jh : all right i 'll get out of the way here ts : i 'm just going to throw this into an orbit and see if i can paint everybody 's shoes in the front jh : whoa that is â€¦ ooh nice ts : so something like this i 'm doing this as a demo and it 's more playful but inevitably all of this can be used i can redeem this painting just continuing on doing layers upon layers and i keep it around for a couple of weeks and i 'm contemplating it and i 'll do another session with it and bring it up to another level where all of this becomes the background the depth of it jh : that 's fantastic so the valves at the bottom of those tubes there are like radio-controlled airplane valves ts : yes they 're servos with cams that pinch these rubber tubes and they can pinch them very tight and stop it or you can have them wide open and all of the colors come out one central port at the bottom you can always be changing colors put aluminum paint or i could put anything into this it could be tomato sauce or anything could be dispensed -- sand powders or anything like that jh : so many forces there you 've got gravity you 've got the centrifugal force you 've got the fluid dynamics each of these beautiful paintings are they images in and of themselves or are they records of a physical event called the pendulum approaching the canvas ts : well this painting here i wanted to do something very simple a simple iconic image of two ripples interfering so the one on the right was done first and then the one on the left was done over it and then i left gaps so you could see the one that was done before and then when i did the second one it really disturbed the piece -- these big blue lines crashing through the center of it -- and so it created a kind of tension and an overlap there are lines in front of the one on the right and there are lines behind the one on the left and so it takes it into different planes what it 's also about just the little events the events of the interpenetration of -- jh : two stars or -- ts : two things that happened -- there 's an interference pattern and then a third thing happens there are shapes that come about just by the marriage of two events that are happening and i 'm very interested in that like the occurrence of moire patterns like this green one this is a painting i did about 10 years ago but it has some -- see in the upper third -- there are these moires and interference patterns that are radio kind of imagery and that 's something that in painting i 've never seen done i 've never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives jh : is that a literal part of the image or is my eye making that interference pattern -- is my eye completing that interference pattern ts : it is the paint actually makes it real it 's really manifested there if i throw a very concentric circle or concentric ellipse it just dutifully makes these evenly spaced lines which get closer and closer together which describes how gravity works there 's something very appealing about the exactitude of science that i really enjoy and i love the shapes that i see in scientific observations and apparatus especially astronomical forms and the idea of the vastness of it the scale is very interesting to me my focus in recent years has kind of shifted more toward biology some of these paintings when you look at them very close odd things appear that really look like horses or birds or crocodiles elephants there are lots of things that appear when you look into it it 's sort of like looking at cloud patterns but sometimes they 're very modeled and highly rendered and then there are all these forms that we do n't know what they are but they 're equally well-resolved and complex so i think conceivably those could be predictive because since it has the ability to make forms that look like forms that we 're familiar with in biology it 's also making other forms that we 're not familiar with and maybe it 's the kind of forms we 'll discover underneath the surface of mars where there are probably lakes with fish swimming under the surface jh : oh let 's hope so oh my god let 's oh please yes oh i 'm so there you know it seems at this stage in your life you also very personally are in this state of confrontation with a sort of dissonant -- i suppose it 's an electromagnetic force that somehow governs your parkinson 's and this creative force that is both the artist who is in the here and now and this sort of arc of your whole life is that relevant to your work ts : as it turns out this device kind of comes in handy because i do n't have to have the fine motor skills to do that i can operate slides which is more of a mental process i 'm looking at it and making decisions : it needs more red it needs more blue it needs a different shape and so i make these creative decisions and can execute them in a much much simpler way i mean i 've got the symptoms i guess parkinson 's kind of creeps up over the years but at a certain point you start seeing the symptoms in my case my left hand has a significant tremor and my left leg also i 'm left-handed and so i draw all my creations really start on small drawings which i have thousands of and it 's my way of just thinking i draw with a simple pencil and at first the parkinson 's was really upsetting because i could n't get the pencil to stand still jh : so you 're not a gatekeeper for these forces you do n't think of yourself as the master of these forces you think of yourself as the servant ts : nature is -- well it 's a godsend it just has so much in it and i think nature wants to express itself in the sense that we are nature humans are of the universe the universe is in our mind and our minds are in the universe and we are expressions of the universe basically as humans ultimately being part of the universe we 're kind of the spokespeople or the observer part of the constituency of the universe and to interface with it with a device that lets these forces that are everywhere act and show what they can do giving them pigment and paint just like an artist it 's a good ally it 's a terrific studio assistant jh : well i love the idea that somewhere within this idea of fine motion and control with the traditional skills that you have with your hand some sort of more elemental force gets revealed and that 's the beauty here tom thank you so much it 's been really really great ts : thank you john i am going to be talking about secrets obviously the best way to divulge a secret is to tell someone to not say anything about it secrets i 'm using powerpoint this year just because you know i 'm into the ted thing and when you use these things you do n't have to go like that you just press it oh man um yes yes i 'm sure ! just change it ! is bill gates here change it ! come on ! what ah ! okay that 's not my slides but it 's okay as you can see these are all maps and maps are important devices for transferring information especially if you have human cognitive ability we can see that all formulas are really maps now as humans we make maps of places that we seldom even go which seems a little wasteful of time this of course is a map of the moon there 're some very delightful names tranquilacalitis [ unclear ] my favorite is frigoris what are these people thinking frigoris what the frigoris you doing names are important frigoris this is the moon people could live there one day i 'll meet you at frigoris no i do n't think so there we see mars again with various names and this is all done by the way by the international astronomical union this is an actual group of people that sit around naming planetary objects this is from their actual book these are some of the names that they have chosen ladies and gentlemen i 'll go through a little of them bolotnitsa that of course is the slavic swamp mermaid now i think the whole concept of a mermaid does n't really blend into the swamp feel " oh look ! mermaid come out of swamp oh boy ! it 's time for bolotnitsa ! " djabran fluctus if that do n't flow off the tongue what does i mean kids are studying this stuff and they 've got the word " fluctus " up there that 's wrong one dyslexic kid and he could be ruining his life " it fluctus up mama " hikuleo fluctus that 's a little more flowing hikuleo sounds like a kind of a leonardo dicaprio 17 syllable thing and that 's the tonga underworld and one of my favorites is the itoki fluctus who is the nicaraguan goddess of insects stars and planets now if you 're a goddess of stars and planets would n't you relegate insects to somebody else " no no really i 'm so busy with the stars would you mind taking the insects thank you darling oh take the spiders too i know they 're not insects but i do n't care monkeys chimps just get rid of the hairy creatures " now we 're going to be going to mars one day and when we do it 's going to be unfair for the people that are living there to have to live with these ridiculous names so you 'll be on mars and you 're at hellespointica depressio which has got to be a really " up " place yeah i 'm at the depressio and i want to get over to amazonis so i plug it into the mars map and click the button and there 's my directions i go to chrysokeras left to the thymiamata then to niliacus lacus which is not a bad name niliacus lacus try to get the practice slick-a-tick-a-bacus that 's a cool name i will say that so i hold back a little of my venom for these astronomical misnomers and then of course arnon to thoth and of course there will be advertisements this is from their rule book the international astronomical union and you know they 're international because they put it " en francais " as well l'union astronomique internationale for those of you who do n't speak french i thought i 'd translate for you from the rulebook : nomenclature is a tool the first consideration make it clear simple and unambiguous and i think that djabran fluctus that fits that mode that 's simple the goddess of goats very simple djabran fluctus " now frank is this clear to you djabran fluctus " " yeah that 's the goat goddess right the abacazanian it 's clear to me " " listen i 'm going back to the swamp mermaid can you call me in a little while " also from the actual document i highlighted a part i thought may be of interest anyone can suggest changing a name so i look to you fellow member of the earth community we 've got to change this stuff up fast so these are actual names of people that work there i did some more investigation these are more people working for this group and as you can see they do n't use their first names these are people naming planets and they wo n't use their first names something is askew here is it because his name is really jupiter blunck is that ganymede andromeda burba is that mars ya marov i do n't know but it 's investigative material no doubt there are some mapping people who do use their names witness please eugene shoemaker who diligently from a young boy decided he wanted to make maps of celestial bodies must have been a very interesting day in the shoemaker house " mom i want to make maps " " that 's wonderful eugene you could make maps of toronto " " no i want to make maps of planets " " yeah go to your room " martians venusians jovians we have names for places where people do n't exist that seems a little silly to me there are no jovians getting back to my premise i used stamps by the way because you do n't have to pay anybody for the rights there is obviously einstein niels bohr de fermat 's last theorem and i 'm not sure whether that 's james coburn or richard harris it 's definitely one of the two i 'm not really clear which one but obviously the point is that numbers are maps and within numbers is there an underlying secret to the universe that is the premise of this particular presentation by the way that 's a natural picture of saturn no adjustments i mean that 's just beautiful so beautiful that i will even give up a laugh to explain my love of this particular planet and the day saturday named after it wonderfully so formulas relate number to form that 's euler his formula was one of the inspirations that lead to the beginning of string theory which is kind of cool not that funny but it is cool he was also famous for having no body which a lot of you are like " how did he figure that out " he 's got no body no man just a head floating high here comes euler and that 's an icosahedron which is one of the five sacred solids very important shapes you see the icosahedron again the dodecahedron it 's dual there is a dodecahedron which i had to do in my room last night the five sacred solids as you can see there which is not to be confused with the five sacred salads blue cheese ranch oil and vinegar thousand islands and house i suggest the house the reality now here is something important what 's important about this is these shapes are duals of each other and you can see how the icosahedron withdraws into the dodecahedron and then they just merge into each other so the whole concept of branes in the universe if the universe is shaped like a dodecahedron this is a very good map of what could possibly be and that is of course what we are here to talk about what a coincidence ! october 9th in france jean-pierre luminet said that the universe is probably shaped like a dodecahedron based on information that they got from this probe this would be a normal wave pattern but what they 're seeing way out there in the far reaches of the microwave background is this kind of odd undulation it does n't plug in to what they suspected a flat universe would be so you can kind of get an idea from this extrapolating that back under this huge picture so we get this idea of what the primal universe looked like and judging from this it looks a little like a cheeseburger so i 'm thinking the universe is either a dodecahedron or a cheeseburger and for me that 's a win-win everybody goes i 'm happy better really hurry up i just threw this in because as important as all of our intellectual abilities are without heart and without love it 's just -- it 's all meaningless and that to me is really beautiful except for that creepy guy in the background getting back to the point of my particular presentation kepler one of my great heroes who realized that these five solids which i spoke of earlier were related somehow to the planets but he could n't prove it it freaked him out but it did lead to newton discovering gravity so maps of things leading to organized understandings of the universe in which we emerge now this is isaac from a vietnamese stamp i am not suggesting at all that my vietnamese brothers and sisters could maybe use a little art class here and there but â€¦ that 's not a good picture not a good picture now my friends in the island of nevis are a little better look at that ! that 's isaac newton that guy is rockin ' what a handsome cat once again nicaragua let me down and copernicus looks like johnny carson which is really weird i do n't get that at all once again these guys rock it out isaac is kickin ' ass man he looks like a rock star this is freaky is a major way this is sierra leone they got little babies in there floating in there man i do n't really need to comment on this but i did n't know that isaac newton was in the moody blues did you when did this happen it 's a different kind of course and they 've got five apples i mean these guys are extrapolating in realms that are not necessarily valid although five is a good number of course ecuador my friend kepler as you can see they call him juan juan no ! johannes not juan it was n't carlos chaplain it 's wrong renÃ© descartes of course once again these grenada people this is like way too sick for anybody 's imagination he 's all murky there is little kids leaning on his leg little ghosts flying around we got ta clean this stuff up fast ladies and gentlemen this is of course the cartesian coordinates once again that 's sierra leone this is again indicating how numbers relate to space relate to form maps of the universe because that 's why we 're here really i think to figure stuff out and to love each other descartes before the horse now monaco took descartes and just flipped him around now monaco is problematic for me and i 'll show you why here is a map all they have is a casino on it and why franklin delano roosevelt is on their map i do n't even want to hazard a guess but i 'd say he 'd been to hellespointica depressio recently this is the flag of monaco ladies and gentlemen the flag of indonesia please examine not sure how this came to be but it 's not right in monaco " no what are you talking about they are so different look ours is more red it 's longer they stole our flag ! they stole our flag ! " bode 's law was n't even his law it was a guy named titus and the reason i just bring this up because it is a law that does n't really work that 's jude law and some of his films recently did n't work just a correlation that indicates how things are misinterpreted and i wonder if the photographer said " okay jude could you touch your tooth that 's good " just a tip if you 're being photographed for press pictures do n't touch your teeth prime numbers gauss one of my favorites golden section i 've been obsessed with this thing since before i was born i know that scares a lot of you but that was my purpose entirely there we can see fibonacci numbers related to the golden section because fibonacci and golden section relate to the unfolding of the measured meter of matter as i refer to it if fibonacci had been on paxil that would be the fibonacci series " ten milligram 20 milligram " " leonardo dinner 's ready put down those books and take your pills " " yes mama " alright where is this going that 's a good question here is the premise that i began 27 years ago if numbers can express the laws of this incredible universe that we live i reason through some sort of reverse engineering we could extrapolate from them some basic structural element of this universe and that 's what i did twenty-seven years ago i started working on this and i tried to build a particle accelerator and that did n't work out well so then i thought a calculator is a metaphor i can just divide numbers that 's like atom smashing that 's what i did that 's how i found moleeds moleeds are what i believe the thing that will allow string theory to be proved they are the nodes on the string patterns and relationships 27 37 that was the first chart i came up with you can see even if you do n't go for the numbers the beauty of the symmetry the numbers from one to 36 divided into six groups symmetry pairs every top adds up to 37 bottom all 74 there is so many intricate relationships that i 'm not going to go there now because you would say " hey go back to the fluctus part " circle of fifths acoustic harmony geometric symmetry i knew those two were related once again the cartesian kind of cross-over so i said if i 'm going to put a circle see what kind of patterns i get boom the red system look at that you ca n't just make this stuff up ladies and gentlemen you ca n't just go around going " oh i 'm going to put some triangles in a circle and they 're going to be symmetrical and they 're all going to add up and it 's going to be oh yeah i figured that out " this is beyond anything anybody could just make up there is the orange system and you 'll see over here these are multiples of the number 27 and they recapitulate that shape even though that 's a circle of nine and that 's a circle of 36 it 's nuts that 's the green system it all folds in half on the green system right between 18 and 19 the blue system the violet it 's all there look at that ! i mean you can not make that stuff up that just does n't fall out of a tree ladies and gentlemen twenty-seven years of my life ! and i 'm presenting it here at ted why because this is the place if aliens land i hope they come here " we are going to destroy the earth hmmm â€¦ maybe not " in this last year i have found these subsequent systems which allow for the mathematic possibilities of the calabi-yau manifolds in a way that does n't necessitate these little hidden dimensions which works mathematically but it just does n't seem god-like to me it just seems like it 's not sexy and elegant it 's hidden i do n't want hidden i want to see it i found other pairs all have symmetry even though unlike the master one their symmetry is split unbelievable this is like crazy am i the only one that sees this you know i did n't just draw this in a day by the way you know try making some charts like this at home you got ta be accurate ! there 's measurement involved increments these are maps by the way not stamps but one day okay i 'm getting to the punch golden ratio it 's crazy and look at this built within it is the golden ratio i start looking at that and look at them again they start looking like planets i go to jpl i look at the orbits of the planets i find 18 examples of it in our solar system i never told anybody this is the first thing this could be history kepler was right eighteen and 19 the middle of the moleeds 0.618 is the golden section multiply them together 18.618 x 19.618 is 365.247 which is .005 different from the number of days in a year hey you ca n't make this up thank you very much thank you thank you well first of all let me thank emeka -- as a matter of fact ted global -- for putting this conference together this conference is going to rank as the most important in the beginning of the 21st century think african governments will put together a conference like this you think the a.u will put together a conference like this even before they do that they will ask for foreign aid i would also like to pay homage and honor to the ted fellows june arunga james shikwati andrew and the other ted fellows i call them the cheetah generation the cheetah generation is a new breed of africans who brook no nonsense about corruption they understand what accountability and democracy is they 're not going to wait for government to do things for them that 's the cheetah generation and africa 's salvation rests on the backs of these cheetahs in contrast of course we have the hippo generation the hippo generation are the ruling elites they are stuck in their intellectual patch complaining about colonialism and imperialism they would n't move one foot if you ask them to reform the economies they 're not going to reform it because they benefit from the rotten status quo now there are a lot of africans who are very angry angry at the condition of africa now we 're talking about a continent that is not poor it is rich in mineral resources natural mineral resources but the mineral wealth of africa is not being utilized to lift its people out of poverty that 's what makes a lot of africans very angry and in a way africa is more than a tragedy in more ways than one there 's another enduring tragedy and that tragedy is that there are so many people so many governments so many organizations who want to help the people in africa they do n't understand now we 're not saying do n't help africa helping africa is noble but helping africa has been turned into a theater of the absurd it 's like the blind leading the clueless there are certain things that we need to recognize africa 's begging-bowl leaks did you know that 40 percent of the wealth created in africa is not invested here in africa it 's taken out of africa that 's what the world bank says look at africa 's begging-bowl it leaks horribly there are people who think that we should pour more money more aid into this bowl which leaks what are the leakages corruption alone costs africa 148 billion dollars a year yes put that aside capital flight out of africa 80 billion a year put that aside let 's take food imports every year africa spends 20 billion dollars to import food just add that up all these leakages that 's far more than the 50 billion tony blair wants to raise for africa now back in the 1960s africa not only fed itself it also exported food not anymore we know that something has gone fundamentally wrong you know it i know it but let 's not waste our time talking about these mistakes because we 'll spend all day here let 's move on and flip over to the next chapter and that 's what this conference is all about -- the next chapter the next chapter begins with first of all asking ourselves this fundamental question " whom do we want to help in africa " there is the people and then there is the government or leaders now the previous speaker before me idris mohammed indicated that we 've had abysmal leadership in africa that characterization in my view is even more charitable i belong to an internet discussion forum an african internet discussion forum and i asked them i said " since 1960 we 've had exactly 204 african heads of state since 1960 " and i asked them to name me just 20 good leaders just 20 good leaders -- you may want to take this leadership challenge yourself i asked them to name me just 20 everybody mentioned nelson mandela of course kwame nkrumah nyerere kenyatta -- somebody mentioned idi amin i let that pass my point is they could n't go beyond 15 even if they had been able to name me 20 what does that tell you 20 out of 204 means that the vast majority of the african leaders failed their people and if you look at them the slate of the post-colonial leaders -- an assortment of military fufu heads swiss-bank socialists crocodile liberators vampire elites quack revolutionaries now this leadership is a far cry from the traditional leaders that africans have known for centuries the second false premise that we make when we 're trying to help africa is that sometimes we think that there is something called a government in africa that cares about its people serves the interests of the people and represents the people there is one particular quote -- a lesotho chief once said that " here in lesotho we 've got two problems : rats and the government " what you and i understand as a government does n't exist in many african countries in fact what we call our governments are vampire states vampires because they suck the economic vitality out of their people government is the problem in africa a vampire state is the government -- -- which has been hijacked by a phalanx of bandits and crooks who use the instruments of state power to enrich themselves their cronies and tribesmen and exclude everybody else the richest people in africa are heads-of-state and ministers and quite often the chief bandit is the head-of-state himself where do they get their money by creating wealth no by raking it off the backs of their suffering people that 's not wealth creation it 's wealth redistribution the third fundamental issue that we have to recognize is that if we want to help the african people we must know where the african people are take any african economy an african economy can be broken up into three sectors there is the modern sector there is the informal sector and the traditional sector the modern sector is the abode of the elites it 's the seat of government in many african countries the modern sector is lost it 's dysfunctional it is a meretricious fandango of imported systems which the elites themselves do n't understand that is the source of many of africa 's problems where the struggles for political power emanate and then spill over onto the informal and the traditional sector claiming innocent lives now the modern sector of course is where a lot of the development aid and resources went into more than 80 percent of ivory coast 's development went into the modern sector the other sectors the informal and the traditional sectors are where you find the majority of the african people the real people in africa that 's where you find them now obviously it makes common sense that if you want to help the people you go where the people are but that 's not what we did as a matter of fact we neglected the informal and the traditional sectors now traditional sector is where africa produces its agriculture which is one of the reasons why africa ca n't feed itself and that 's why it must import food all right you can not develop africa by ignoring the informal and the traditional sectors and you ca n't develop the informal and the traditional sectors without an operational understanding of how these two sectors work these two sectors let me describe to you have their own indigenous institutions first one is the political system traditionally africans hate governments they hate tyranny if you look into their traditional systems africans organize their states in two types the first one belongs to those ethnic societies who believe that the state was necessarily tyrannous so they did n't want to have anything to do with any centralized authority these societies are the ibo the somali the kikuyus for example they have no chiefs the other ethnic groups which did have chiefs made sure that they surrounded the chiefs with councils upon councils upon councils to prevent them from abusing their power in ashanti tradition for example the chief can not make any decision without the concurrence of the council of elders without the council the chief ca n't pass any law and if the chief does n't govern according to the will of the people he will be removed if not the people will abandon the chief go somewhere else and set up a new settlement and even if you look in ancient african empires they were all organized around one particular principle -- the confederacy principle which is characterized by a great deal of devolution of authority decentralization of power now this is what i have described to you this is part of africa 's indigenous political heritage now compare that to the modern systems the ruling elites established on africa it is a total far cry in the economic system in traditional africa the means of production is privately owned it 's owned by extended families you see in the west the basic economic and social unit is the individual the american will say " i am because i am and i can damn well do anything i want anytime " the accent is on the " i " in africa the africans say " i am because we are " the " we " connotes community -- the extended family system the extended family system pools its resources together they own farms they decide what to do what to produce they do n't take any orders from their chiefs they decide what to do and when they produce their crops they sell the surplus on marketplaces when they make a profit it is theirs to keep not for the chief to sequester it from them so in a nutshell what we had in traditional africa was a free-market system there were markets in africa before the colonialists stepped foot on the continent timbuktu was one great big market town kano salaga -- they were all there even if you go to west africa you notice that market activity in west africa has always been dominated by women so it 's quite appropriate that this section is called a marketplace the market is not alien to africa what africans practiced was a different form of capitalism but then after independence all of a sudden markets capitalism became a western institution and the leaders said africans were ready for socialism nonsense and even then what kind of socialism did they practice the socialism that they practiced was a peculiar form of swiss-bank socialism which allowed the heads of states and the ministers to rape and plunder africa 's treasuries for deposit in switzerland that is not the kind of system africans had known for centuries what do we do now go back to africa 's indigenous institutions and this is where we charge the cheetahs to go into the informal sectors the traditional sectors that 's where you find the african people and i 'd like to show you a quick little video about the informal sector about the boat-building that i myself tried to mobilize africans in the diaspora to invest in could you please show that the men are going fishing in these small boats yes it 's an enterprise this is by a local ghanaian entrepreneur using his own capital he 's getting no assistance from the government and he 's building a second bigger boat a bigger boat will mean more fish will be caught and landed it means that he will be able to employ more ghanaians it also means that he will be able to generate wealth and then it will have what economists call external effects on a local economy all that you need to do all that the elites need to do is to move this operation into something that is enclosed so that the operation can be made more efficient now it is not just this informal sector there is also traditional medicine 80 percent of africans still rely on traditional medicine the modern healthcare sector has totally collapsed now this is an area -- i mean there is a treasure trove of wealth in the traditional medicine area this is where we need to mobilize africans in the diaspora especially to invest in this we also need to mobilize africans in the diaspora not only to go into the traditional sectors but to go into agriculture and also to instigate change from within we were able to mobilize ghanaians in the diaspora to instigate change in ghana and bring about democracy in ghana and i know that with the cheetahs we can take africa back one village at a time thank you very much zach kaplan : keith and i lead a research team we investigate materials and technologies that have unexpected properties over the last three years we found over 200 of these things and so we looked back into our library and selected six we thought would be most surprising for ted of these six the first one that we 're going to talk about is in the black envelope you 're holding it comes from a company in japan called geltech now go ahead and open it up keith schacht : now be sure and take the two pieces apart what 's unexpected about this is that it 's soft but it 's also a strong magnet zach and i have always been fascinated observing unexpected things like this we spent a long time thinking about why this is and it 's just recently that we realized : it 's when we see something unexpected it changes our understanding of the way things work as you 're seeing this gel magnet for the first time if you assume that all magnets had to be hard then seeing this surprised you and it changed your understanding of the way magnets could work zk : now it 's important to understand what the unexpected properties are but to really think about the implications of what this makes possible we found that it helps to think about how it could be applied in the world so a first idea is to use it on cabinet doors if you line the sides of the cabinets using the gel material -- if a cabinet slams shut it would n't make a loud noise and in addition the magnets would draw the cabinets closed imagine taking the same material but putting it on the bottom of a sneaker you know this way you could go to the container store and buy one of those metal sheets that they hang on the back of your door in your closet and you could literally stick your shoes up instead of using a shelf for me i really love this idea if you come to my apartment and see my closet i 'm sure you 'd figure out why : it 's a mess ks : seeing the unexpected properties and then seeing a couple of applications -- it helps you see why this is significant what the potential is but we 've found that the way we present our ideas it makes a big difference zk : it was like six months ago that keith and i were out in l.a. and we were at starbucks having coffee with roman coppola he works on mostly music videos and commercials with his company the directors bureau as we were talking roman told us that he 's kind of an inventor on the side and we were showing him the same gel magnet that you 're holding in your hand -- and you know we shared the same ideas and you could see it in his face : roman starts to get really excited and he whips out this manila folder ; he opens it up and keith and i look in and he starts showing us concepts that he 's been working on these things just get him really excited and so we 're looking at these concepts and we were just like whoa this guy 's good because the way that he presented the concept -- his approach was totally different than ours he sold it to you as if it was for sale right now when we were going in the car back to the airport we were thinking : why was this so powerful and as we thought about it more we realized that it let you fill in all the details about the experience just as if you saw it on tv so for ted we decided to take our favorite idea for the gel magnet and work with roman and his team at the directors bureau to create a commercial for a product from the future narrator : do you have a need for speed inventables water adventures dares you to launch yourself on a magnetically-levitating board down a waterslide so fast so tall that when you hit the bottom it uses brakes to stop aqua rocket : coming this summer ks : now we showed the concept to a few people before this and they asked us when 's it coming out so i just wanted to let you know it 's not actually coming out just the concept is zk : so now when we dream up these concepts it 's important for us to make sure that they work from a technical standpoint so i just want to quickly explain how this would work this is the magnetically-levitating board that they mentioned in the commercial the gel that you 're holding would be lining the bottom of the board now this is important for two reasons one : the soft properties of the magnet that make it so that if it were to hit the rider in the head it would n't injure him in addition you can see from the diagram on the right the underpart of the slide would be an electromagnet so this would actually repel the rider a little bit as you 're going down the force of the water rushing down in addition to that repulsion force would make this slide go faster than any slide on the market it 's because of this that you need the magnetic braking system when you get to the very bottom of the slide -- -- the rider passes through an aluminum tube and i 'm going to kick it to keith to explain why that 's important from a technical standpoint ks : so i 'm sure all you engineers know that even though aluminum is a metal it 's not a magnetic material but something unexpected happens when you drop a magnet down an aluminum tube so we set up a quick experiment here to show that to you now you see the magnet fell really slowly now i 'm not going to get into the physics of it but all you need to know is that the faster the magnet 's falling the greater the stopping force zk : now our next technology is actually a 10-foot pole and i have it right here in my pocket there 're a few different versions of it ks : some of them automatically unroll like this one they can be made to automatically roll up or they can be made stable like zach 's to hold any position in between zk : as we were talking to the vendor -- to try to learn about how you could apply these or how they 're being applied currently -- he was telling us that in the military they use this one so soldiers can keep it on their chests -- very concealed -- and then when they 're out on the field erect it as an antenna to clearly send signals back to the base in our brainstorms we came up with the idea you could use it for a soccer goal : so at the end of the game you just roll up the goal and put it in your gym bag ks : now the interesting thing about this is you do n't have to be an engineer to appreciate why a 10-foot pole that can fit in your pocket is so interesting so we decided to go out onto the streets of chicago and ask a few people on the streets what they thought you could do with this man : i clean my ceiling fans with that and i get the spider webs off my house -- i do it that way woman : i 'd make my very own walking stick woman : i would create a ladder to use to get up on top of the tree woman : an olive server man : some type of extension pole -- like what the painters use woman : i would make a spear that when you went deep sea diving you could catch the fish really fast and then roll it back up and you could swim easier â€¦ yeah zk : now for our next technology we 're going to do a little demonstration and so we need a volunteer from the audience you sir come on up come on up tell everybody your name steve jurvetson : steve zk : it 's steve all right steve now follow me we need you to stand right in front of the ted sign right there that 's great and hold onto this good luck to you ks : no not yet zk : i 'd just like to let you all know that this presentation has been brought to you by target ks : little bit -- that 's perfect just perfect now zach we 're going to demonstrate a water gun fight from the future so here come on up to the front all right so now if you 'll see here -- no no it 's ok so describe to the audience the temperature of your shirt go ahead sj : it 's cold ks : now the reason it 's cold is that 's it 's not actually water loaded into these squirt guns -- it 's a dry liquid developed by 3m it 's perfectly clear it 's odorless it 's colorless it 's so safe you could drink this stuff and the reason it feels cold is because it evaporates 25 times faster than water all right well thanks for coming up zk : wait wait steven -- before you go we filled this with the dry liquid so during the break you can shoot your friends sj : excellent thank you ks : thanks for coming up let 's give him a big round of applause so what 's the significance of this dry liquid early versions of the fluid were actually used on a cray supercomputer now the unexpected thing about this is that zach could stand up on stage and drench a perfectly innocent member of the audience without any concern that we 'd damage the electronics that we 'd get him wet that we 'd hurt the books or the computers it works because it 's non-conductive so you can see here you can immerse a whole circuit board in this and it would n't cause any damage you can circulate it to draw the heat away but today it 's most widely used in office buildings -- in the sprinkler system -- as a fire-suppression fluid again it 's perfectly safe for people it puts out the fires does n't hurt anything but our favorite idea for this was using it in a basketball game so during halftime it could rain down on the players cool everyone down and in a matter of minutes it would dry would n't hurt the court zk : our next technology comes to us from a company in japan called sekisui chemical one of their r & amp ; d engineers was working on a way to make plastic stiffer while he was doing this he noticed an unexpected thing we have a video to show you ks : so you see there it did n't bounce back now this was an unintended side effect of some experiments they were doing it 's technically called " shape-retaining property " now think about your interactions with aluminum foil shape-retaining is common in metal : you bend a piece of aluminum foil and it holds its place contrast that with a plastic garbage can -- and you can push in the sides and it always bounces back zk : for example you could make a watch that wraps around your wrist but does n't use a buckle taking it a little further if you wove those strips together -- kind of like a little basket -- you could make a shape-retaining sheet and then you could embed it in a cloth : so you could make a picnic sheet that wraps around the table so that way on a windy day it would n't blow away for our next technology it 's hard to observe the unexpected property by itself because it 's an ink so we 've prepared a video to show it applied to paper ks : as this paper is bending the resistance of the ink changes so with simple electronics you can detect how much the page is being bent now to think about the potential for this think of all the places ink is supplied : on business cards on the back of cereal boxes board games any place you use ink you could change the way you interact with it zk : so my favorite idea for this is to apply the ink to a book this could totally change the way that you interface with paper you see the dark line on the side and the top as you turn the pages of the book the book can actually detect what page you 're on based on the curvature of the pages in addition if you were to fold in one of the corners then you could program the book to actually email you the text on the page for your notes ks : for our last technology we worked again with roman and his team at the directors bureau to develop a commercial from the future to explain how it works old milk carton : oh yeah it smells good who are you new milk carton : i 'm new milk omc : i used to smell like you narrator : fresh watch from inventables dairy farms packaging that changes color when your milk 's gone off do n't let milk spoil your morning zk : now this technology was developed by these two guys : professor ken suslick and neil rakow of the university of illinois ks : now the way it works : there 's a matrix of color dyes and these dyes change color in response to odors so the smell of vanilla that might change the four on the left to brown and the one on the right to yellow this matrix can produce thousands of different color combinations to represent thousands of different smells but like in the milk commercial if you know what odor you want to detect then they can formulate a specific dye to detect just that odor zk : right it was that that started a conversation with professor suslick and myself and he was explaining to me the things that this is making possible beyond just detecting spoiled food it 's really where the significance of it lies his company actually did a survey of firemen all across the country to try to learn how are they currently testing the air when they respond to an emergency scene and he kind of comically explained that time after time what the firemen would say is : they would rush to the scene of the crime ; they would look around ; if there were no dead policemen it was ok to go i mean this is a true story they 're using policemen as canaries but more seriously they determined that you could develop a device that can smell better than the humans and say if it 's safe for the firemen in addition he 's spun off a company from the university called chemsensing where they 're working on medical equipment so a patient can come in and actually blow into their device by detecting the odor of particular bacteria or viruses or even lung cancer the dots will change and they can use software to analyze the results this can radically improve the way that doctors diagnose patients currently they 're using a method of trial and error but this could tell you precisely what disease you have ks : so that was the six we had for you today but i hope you 're starting to see why we find these things so fascinating because every one of these six changed our understanding of what was possible in the world prior to seeing this we would have assumed : a 10-foot pole could n't fit in your pocket ; something as inexpensive as ink could n't sense the way paper is being bent ; every one of these things -- and we 're constantly trying to find more zk : this is something that keith and i really enjoy doing i 'm sure it 's obvious to you now but it was actually yesterday that i was reminded of why i was having a conversation with steve jurvetson over downstairs by the escalators and he was telling me that when chris sent out that little box one of the items in it was the hydrophobic sand -- the sand that does n't get wet he said that he was playing with it with his son and you know his son was mesmerized because he would dunk it in the water he would take it out and it was bone dry a few weeks later he said that his son was playing with a lock of his mother 's hair and he noticed that there were some drops of water on the hair and he took the thing and he looked up to steve and he said " look hydrophobic string " i mean after hearing that story -- that really summed it up for me thank you very much ks : thank you you will understand nothing with my type of english it 's good for you because you can have a break after all these fantastic people i must tell you i am like that not very comfortable because usually in life i think my job is absolutely useless i mean i feel useless now after carolyn and all the other guys i feel like shit and definitively i do n't know why i am here but -- you know the nightmare you can have like you are an impostor you arrive at the opera and they push you " you must sing ! " i do n't know so so because i have nothing to show nothing to say we shall try to speak about something else we can start if you want by understanding -- it 's just to start it 's not interesting but -- how i work when somebody comes to me and ask for what i am known i mean yes lemon squeezer toilet brush toothpick beautiful toilet seats and why not -- a toothbrush i do n't try to design the toothbrush i do n't try to say " oh that will be a beautiful object " or something like that that does n't interest me because there is different types of design the one we can call it the cynical design that means the design invented by raymond loewy in the '50s who said what is ugly is a bad sale la laideur se vend mal which is terrible it means the design must be just the weapon for marketing for producer to make product more sexy like that they sell more : it 's shit it 's obsolete it 's ridiculous i call that the cynical design after there is the narcissistic design : it 's a fantastic designer who designs only for other fantastic designers after there is people like me who try to deserve to exist and who are so ashamed to make this useless job who try to do it in another way and they try i try to not make the object for the object but for the result for the profit for the human being the person who will use it if we take the toothbrush -- i do n't think about the toothbrush i think " what will be the effect of the brush in the mouth " and to understand what will be the effect of the toothbrush in the mouth i must imagine : who owns this mouth what is the life of the owner of this mouth in what society [ does ] this guy live what civilization creates this society what animal species creates this civilization when i arrive -- and i take one minute i am not so intelligent -- when i arrive at the level of animal species that becomes real interesting me i have strictly no power to change anything but when i come back i can understand why i shall not do it because today to not do it it 's more positive than do it or how i shall do it but to come back where i am at the animal species there is things to see there is things to see there is the big challenge the big challenge in front of us because there is not a human production which exists outside of what i call " the big image " the big image is our story our poetry our romanticism our poetry is our mutation our life we must remember and we can see that in any book of my son of 10 years old that life appears four billion years ago around -- four billion point two voice offstage : four point five yes point five ok ok ok ! i 'm a designer that 's all of christmas gifts and before there was this soup called " soupe primordiale " this first soup -- bloop bloop bloop -- sort of dirty mud no life nothing so then -- pshoo-shoo -- lightning -- pshoo -- arrive -- pshoo-shoo -- makes life -- bloop bloop -- and that dies some million years after -- pshoo-shoo bloop-bloop -- ah wake up ! at the end finally that succeeds and life appears we was so so stupid the most stupid bacteria even i think we copy our way to reproduce you know what i mean and something of -- oh no forget it after we become a fish ; after we become a frog ; after we become a monkey ; after we become what we are today : a super-monkey and the fun is the super-monkey we are today is at half of the story can you imagine from that stupid bacteria to us with a microphone with a computer with an ipod : four billion years and we know and especially carolyn knows that when the sun will implode the earth will burn explode i do n't know what and this is scheduled for four four billion years yes she said something like that ok that means we are at half of the story fantastic ! it 's a beauty ! can you imagine it 's very symbolic because the bacteria we was had no idea of what we are today and today we have no idea of what we shall be in four billion years and this territory is fantastic that is our poetry that is our beautiful story it 's our romanticism mu-ta-tion we are mutants and if we do n't deeply understand if we do n't integrate that we are mutants we completely miss the story because every generation thinks we are the final one we have a way to look at earth like that you know " i am the man the final man you know we mutate during four billion years before but now because it 's me we stop fin for the end for the eternity it is one with a red jacket " something like that i am not sure of that because that is our intelligence of mutation and things like that there is so many things to do ; it 's so fresh and here is something : nobody is obliged to be a genius but everybody is obliged to participate and to participate for a mutant there is a minimum of exercise a minimum of sport we can say that the first if you want -- there is so many -- but one which is very easy to do is the duty of vision i can explain you i shall try if you walk like that it 's ok it 's ok you can walk but perhaps because you walk with the eyes like that you will not see oh there is a hole and you will fall and you will die dangerous that 's why perhaps you will try to have this angle of vision ok i can see if i found something up up and they continue up up up i raise the angle of vision but it 's still very -- selfish selfish egoiste -- yes selfish you you survive it 's ok if you raise the level of your eyes a little more you go " i see you oh my god you are here how are you i can help you i can design for you a new toothbrush new toilet brush " something like that i live in society ; i live in community it 's ok. you start to be in the territory of intelligence we can say from this level the more you can raise this angle of view the more you will be important for the society the more you will rise the more you will be important for the civilization the more you will rise to see far and high like that the more you will be important for the story of our mutation that means intelligent people are in this angle that is intelligence from this to here that it 's genius ptolemy eratosthenes einstein things like that nobody 's obliged to be a genius it 's better but nobody take care in this training to be a good mutant there is some danger there is some trap one trap : the vertical because at the vertical of us if you look like that " ah ! my god there is god ah ! god ! " god is a trap god is the answer when we do n't know the answer that means when your brain is not enough big when you do n't understand you go " ah it 's god it 's god " that 's ridiculous that 's why -- jump like that no do n't jump come back because after there is another trap if you look like that you look to the past or you look inside if you are very flexible inside yourself it 's called schizophrenia and you are dead also that 's why every morning now because you are a good mutant you will raise your angle of view out more of the horizontal you are an intelligence never forget -- like that like that it 's very very very important what what else we can say about that why do that it 's because we -- if we look from far we see our line of evolution this line of evolution is clearly positive from far this line looks very smooth like that but if you take a lens like that this line is ack ack ack ack ack like that it 's made of light and shadow we can say light is civilization shadow is barbaria and it 's very important to know where we are because some cycle there is a spot in the cycle and you have not the same duty in the different parts of the cycle that means we can imagine -- i do n't say it was fantastic but in the '80s there was not too much war like that it was -- we can imagine that the civilization can become civilized in this case people like me are acceptable we can say " it 's luxurious time " we have time to think we have time to i do n't know what speak about art and things like that it 's ok. we are in the light but sometimes like today we fall we fall so fast so fast to shadow we fall so fast to barbaria with many many many many face of barbaria because it 's not the barbaria we have today it 's perhaps not the barbaria we think there is different type of barbaria that 's why we must adapt that means when barbaria is back forget the beautiful chairs forget the beautiful hotel forget design even -- i 'm sorry to say -- forget art forget all that there is priority ; there is urgency you must go back to politics you must go back to radicalization i 'm sorry if that 's not very english you must go back to fight to battle that 's why today i 'm so ashamed to make this job that 's why i am here to try to do it the best possible but i know that even i do it the best possible -- that 's why i 'm the best -- it 's nothing because it 's not the right time that 's why i say that i say that because i repeat nothing exist if it 's not in the good reason the reason of our beautiful dream of this civilization and because we must all work to finish this story because the scenario of this civilization -- about love progress and things like that -- it 's ok but there is so many different other scenarios of other civilizations this scenario of this civilization was about becoming powerful intelligent like this idea we have invented this concept of god we are god now we are it 's almost done we have just to finish the story that is very very important and when you do n't understand really what 's happened you can not go and fight and work and build and things like that you go to the future back back back back like that and you can fall and it 's very dangerous no you must really understand that because we have almost finished i 'll repeat this story and the beauty of this in perhaps 50 years 60 years we can finish completely this civilization and offer to our children the possibility to invent a new story a new poetry a new romanticism with billions of people who have been born worked lived and died before us these people who have worked so much we have now bring beautiful things beautiful gifts we know so many things we can say to our children ok done that was our story that passed now you have a duty : invent a new story invent a new poetry the only rule is we have not to have any idea about the next story we give you white pages invent we give you the best tools the best tools and now do it that 's why i continue to work even if it 's for toilet brush to be new at ted -- it 's like being the last high-school virgin you know that all of the cool people are -- they 're doing it and you 're on the outside you 're at home you 're like the raspyni brothers where you 've got your balls in cold water and -- -- you just play with your fingers all day and then you get invited and you 're on the inside and it 's everything you hoped it would be it 's exciting and there 's music playing all of the time and then suddenly it 's over and it 's only taken five minutes and you want to go back and do it again but i really appreciate being here and thank you chris and also thank you deborah patton for making this possible so anyway today we 'll talk about architecture a little bit within the subject of creation and optimism and if you put creation and optimism together you 've got two choices that you can talk about you can talk about creationism -- which i think would n't go down well with this audience at least not from a view where you were a proponent of it -- or you can talk about optimisations spelled the british way with an s instead of a z and i think that 's what i 'd like to talk about today but any kind of conversation about architecture -- which is in fact what you were just talking about what was going on here setting up ted small-scale architecture -- at the present time ca n't really happen without a conversation about this the world trade center and what 's been going on there what it means to us because if architecture is what i believe it to be which is the built form of our cultural ambitions what do you do when presented with an opportunity to rectify a situation that represents somebody else 's cultural ambitions relative to us and our own opportunity to make something new there this has been a really galvanizing issue for a long time i think that the world trade center in rather an unfortunate way brought architecture into focus in a way that i do n't think people had thought of in a long time and made it a subject for common conversation i do n't remember in my 20-year career of practicing and writing about architecture a time when five people sat me down at a table and asked me very serious questions about zoning fire exiting safety concerns and whether carpet burns these are just not things we talked about very often and yet now it 's talked about all the time at the point where you can weaponize your buildings you have to suddenly think about architecture in a very different way and so now we 're going to think about architecture in a very different way we 're going to think about it like this how many of you saw usa today today there it is looks like that there 's the world trade center site on the front cover they 've made a selection they 've chosen a project by daniel libeskind the enfant terrible of the moment of architecture child-prodigy piano player he started on the squeezebox and moved to a little more serious issue a bigger instrument and now to an even larger instrument upon which to work his particular brand of deconstructivist magic as you see here he was one of six people who were invited to participate in this competition after six previous firms struck out with things that were so stupid and banal that even the city of new york was forced to go " oh i 'm really sorry we screwed up " right can we do this again from the top except use some people with a vague hint of talent instead of just six utter boobs like we brought in last time real estate hacks of the kind who usually plan our cities let 's bring in some real architects for a change and so we got this or we had a choice of that oh stop clapping it 's too late that is gone this was a scheme by a team called think a new york-based team and then there was that one which was the libeskind scheme this one this is going to be the new world trade center : a giant hole in the ground with big buildings falling into it now i do n't know what you think but i think this is a pretty stupid decision because what you 've done is just made a permanent memorial to destruction by making it look like the destruction is going to continue forever but that 's what we 're going to do but i want you to think about these things in terms of a kind of ongoing struggle that american architecture represents and that these two things talk about very specifically and that is the wild divergence in how we choose our architects in trying to decide whether we want architecture from the kind of technocratic solution to everything -- that there is a large technical answer that can solve all problems be they social be they physical be they chemical -- or something that 's more of a romantic solution now i do n't mean romantic as in this is a nice place to take someone on a date i mean romantic in the sense of there are things larger and grander than us so in the american tradition the difference between the technocratic and the romantic would be the difference between thomas jefferson 's cartesian grids spreading across the united states that gives us basically the whole shape of every western state in the united states as a really truly technocratic solution a bowing to the -- in jefferson 's time -- current popular philosophy of rationalism or the way we went to describe that later : manifest destiny now which would you rather be a grid or manifest destiny manifest destiny it 's a big deal it sounds big it sounds important it sounds solid it sounds american ballsy serious male and that kind of fight has gone on back and forth in architecture all the time i mean it goes on in our private lives too every single day we all want to go out and buy an audi tt do n't we everyone here must own one or at least they craved one the moment they saw one and then they hopped in it turned the little electronic key rather than the real key zipped home on their new superhighway and drove straight into a garage that looks like a tudor castle why why why do you want to do that why do we all want to do that i even owned a tudor thing once myself it 's in our nature to go ricocheting back and forth between this technocratic solution and a larger sort of more romantic image of where we are so we 're going to go straight into this can i have the lights off for a moment i 'm going to talk about two architects very very briefly that represent the current split architecturally between these two traditions of a technocratic or technological solution and a romantic solution and these are two of the top architectural practices in the united states today one very young one a little more mature this is the work of a firm called shop and what you 're seeing here is their isometric drawings of what will be a large-scale camera obscura in a public park does everybody know what a camera obscura is yeah it 's one of those giant camera lenses that takes a picture of the outside world -- it 's sort of a little movie without any moving parts -- and projects it on a page and you can see the world outside you as you walk around it this is just the outline of it and you can see does it look like a regular building no it 's actually non-orthogonal : it 's not up and down square rectangular anything like that that you 'd see in a normal shape of a building the computer revolution the technocratic technological revolution has allowed us to jettison normal-shaped buildings traditionally shaped buildings in favor of non-orthogonal buildings such as this what 's interesting about it is not the shape what 's interesting about it is how it 's made how it 's made a brand-new way to put buildings together something called mass customization no it is not an oxymoron what makes the building expensive in the traditional sense is making individual parts custom that you ca n't do over and over again that 's why we all live in developer houses they all want to save money by building the same thing 500 times that 's because it 's cheaper mass customization works by an architect feeding into a computer a program that says manufacture these parts the computer then talks to a machine -- a computer-operated machine a cad-cam machine -- that can make a zillion different changes at a moment 's notice because the computer is just a machine it does n't care it 's manufacturing the parts it does n't see any excess cost it does n't spend any extra time it 's not a laborer -- it 's simply an electronic lathe so the parts can all be cut at the same time meanwhile instead of sending someone working drawings which are those huge sets of blueprints that you 've seen your whole life what the architect can do is send a set of assembly instructions like you used to get when you were a child when you bought little models that said " bolt a to b and c to d " and so what the builder will get is every single individual part that has been custom manufactured off-site and delivered on a truck to the site to that builder and a set of these instruction manuals just simple " bolt a to b " and they will be able to put them together here 's the little drawing that tells them how that works -- and that 's what will happen in the end you 're underneath it looking up into the lens of the camera obscura lest you think this is all fiction lest you think this is all fantasy or romance these same architects were asked to produce something for the central courtyard of ps1 which is a museum in brooklyn new york as part of their young architects summer series and they said well it 's summer what do you do in the summer you go to the beach and when you go to the beach what do you get you get sand dunes so let 's make architectural sand dunes and a beach cabana so they went out and they modeled a computer model of a sand dune they took photographs they fed the photographs into their computer program and that computer program shaped a sand dune and then took that sand dune shape and turned it into -- at their instructions using standard software with slight modifications -- a set of instructions for pieces of wood and those are the pieces of wood those are the instructions these are the pieces and here 's a little of that blown up what you can see is there 's about six different colors and each color represents a type of wood to be cut a piece of wood to be cut all of which were delivered by flat bed on a truck and hand assembled in 48 hours by a team of eight people only one of whom had ever seen the plans before only one of whom had ever seen the plans before and here comes dune-scape coming up out of the courtyard and there it is fully built there are only 16 different pieces of wood only 16 different assembly parts here looks like a beautiful piano sounding board on the inside it has its own built-in swimming pool very very cool it 's a great place for parties -- it was it was only up for six weeks it 's got little dressing rooms and cabanas where lots of interesting things went on all summer long now lest you think that this is only for the light at heart or just temporary installations this is the same firm working at the world trade center replacing the bridge that used to go across west street that very important pedestrian connection between the city of new york and the redevelopment of the west side they were asked to design replace that bridge in six weeks building it including all of the parts manufactured and they were able to do it that was their design using that same computer modeling system and only five or six really different kinds of parts a couple of struts like this some exterior cladding material and a very simple framing system that was all manufactured off-site and delivered by truck they were able to create that they were able to create something wonderful they 're now building a 16-story building on the side of new york using the same technology here we 're going to walk across the bridge at night it 's self-lit you do n't need any overhead lighting so the neighbors do n't complain about metal-halide lighting in their face here it is going across and there down the other side and you get the same kind of grandeur now let me show you quickly the opposite if i may woo pretty huh this is the other side of the coin this is the work of david rockwell from new york city whose work you can see out here today the current king of the romantics who approaches his work in a very different fashion it 's not to create a technological solution it 's to seduce you into something that you can do into something that will please you something that will lift your spirits something that will make you feel as if are in another world -- such as his nobu restaurant in new york which is supposed to take you from the clutter of new york city to the simplicity of japan and the elegance of japanese tradition " when it 's all said and done it 's got to look like seaweed " said the owner or his restaurant pod in philadelphia pennsylvania i want you to know the room you 're looking at is stark white every single surface of this restaurant is white the reason it has so much color is that it changes using lighting it 's all about sensuality it 's all about transforming watch this -- i 'm not touching any buttons ladies and gentlemen this is happening by itself it transforms through the magic of lighting it 's all about sensuality it 's all about touch rosa mexicano restaurant where he transports us to the shores of acapulco up on the upper west side with this wall of cliff divers who -- there you go like that let 's see it one more time okay just to make sure that you 've enjoyed it and finally it 's about comfort it 's about making you feel good in places that you would n't have felt good before it 's about bringing nature to the inside in the guardian tower of new york converted to a w union square -- i 'm sorry i 'm rushing -- where we had to bring in the best horticulturists in the world to make sure that the interior of this dragged the garden space of the court garden of the union square into the building itself it 's about stimulation this is a wine-buying experience simplified by color and taste fizzy fresh soft luscious juicy smooth big and sweet wines all explained to you by color and texture on the wall and finally it 's about entertainment as in his headquarters for the cirque du soleil orlando florida where you 're asked to enter the greek theater look under the tent and join the magic world of cirque du soleil and i think i 'll probably leave it at that thank you very much i 'm here today as june said to talk about a project that my twin sister and i have been doing for the past three and half years we 're crocheting a coral reef and it 's a project that we 've actually been now joined by hundreds of people around the world who are doing it with us indeed thousands of people have actually been involved in this project in many of its different aspects it 's a project that now reaches across three continents and its roots go into the fields of mathematics marine biology feminine handicraft and environmental activism it 's true it 's also a project that in a very beautiful way the development of this has actually paralleled the evolution of life on earth which is a particularly lovely thing to be saying right here in february 2009 -- which as one of our previous speakers told us is the 200th anniversary of the birth of charles darwin all of this i 'm going to get to in the next 18 minutes i hope but let me first begin by showing you some pictures of what this thing looks like just to give you an idea of scale that installation there is about six feet across and the tallest models are about two or three feet high this is some more images of it that one on the right is about five feet high the work involves hundreds of different crochet models and indeed there are now thousands and thousands of models that people have contributed all over the world as part of this the totality of this project involves tens of thousands of hours of human labor -- 99 percent of it done by women on the right hand side that bit there is part of an installation that is about 12 feet long my sister and i started this project in 2005 because in that year at least in the science press there was a lot of talk about global warming and the effect that global warming was having on coral reefs corals are very delicate organisms and they are devastated by any rise in sea temperatures it causes these vast bleaching events that are the first signs of corals of being sick and if the bleaching does n't go away -- if the temperatures do n't go down -- reefs start to die a great deal of this has been happening in the great barrier reef particularly in coral reefs all over the world this is our invocation in crochet of a bleached reef we have a new organization together called the institute for figuring which is a little organization we started to promote to do projects about the aesthetic and poetic dimensions of science and mathematics and i went and put a little announcement up on our site asking for people to join us in this enterprise to our surprise one of the first people who called was the andy warhol museum and they said they were having an exhibition about artists ' response to global warming and they 'd like our coral reef to be part of it i laughed and said " well we 've only just started it you can have a little bit of it " so in 2007 we had an exhibition a small exhibition of this crochet reef and then some people in chicago came along and they said " in late 2007 the theme of the chicago humanities festival is global warming and we 've got this 3,000 square-foot gallery and we want you to fill it with your reef " and i naively by this stage said " oh yes sure " now i say " naively " because actually my profession is as a science writer what i do is i write books about the cultural history of physics i 've written books about the history of space the history of physics and religion and i write articles for people like the new york times and the l.a. times so i had no idea what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery so i said yes to this proposition and i went home and i told my sister christine and she nearly had a fit because christine is a professor at one of l.a. 's major art colleges calarts and she knew exactly what it meant to fill a 3,000 square-foot gallery she thought i 'd gone off my head but she went into crochet overdrive and to cut a long story short eight months later we did fill the chicago cultural center 's 3,000 square foot gallery by this stage the project had taken on a viral dimension of its own which got completely beyond us the people in chicago decided that as well as exhibiting our reefs what they wanted to do was have the local people there make a reef so we went and taught the techniques we did workshops and lectures and the people in chicago made a reef of their own and it was exhibited alongside ours there were hundreds of people involved in that we got invited to do the whole thing in new york and in london and in los angeles in each of these cities the local citizens hundreds and hundreds of them have made a reef and more and more people get involved in this most of whom we 've never met so the whole thing has sort of morphed into this organic ever-evolving creature that 's actually gone way beyond christine and i now some of you are sitting here thinking " what planet are these people on why on earth are you crocheting a reef woolenness and wetness are n't exactly two concepts that go together why not chisel a coral reef out of marble cast it in bronze " but it turns out there is a very good reason why we are crocheting it because many organisms in coral reefs have a very particular kind of structure the frilly crenulated forms that you see in corals and kelps and sponges and nudibranchs is a form of geometry known as hyperbolic geometry and the only way that mathematicians know how to model this structure is with crochet it happens to be a fact it 's almost impossible to model this structure any other way and it 's almost impossible to do it on computers so what is this hyperbolic geometry that corals and sea slugs embody the next few minutes is we 're all going to get raised up to the level of a sea slug this sort of geometry revolutionized mathematics when it was first discovered in the 19th century but not until 1997 did mathematicians actually understand how they could model it in 1997 a mathematician at cornell daina taimina made the discovery that this structure could actually be done in knitting and crochet the first one she did was knitting but you get too many stitches on the needle so she quickly realized crochet was the better thing but what she was doing was actually making a model of a mathematical structure that many mathematicians had thought it was actually impossible to model and indeed they thought that anything like this structure was impossible per se some of the best mathematicians spent hundreds of years trying to prove that this structure was impossible so what is this impossible hyperbolic structure before hyperbolic geometry mathematicians knew about two kinds of space : euclidean space and spherical space and they have different properties mathematicians like to characterize things by being formalist you all have a sense of what a flat space is euclidean space is but mathematicians formalize this in a particular way and what they do is they do it through the concept of parallel lines so here we have a line and a point outside the line and euclid said " how can i define parallel lines i ask the question how many lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line " and you all know the answer does someone want to shout it out one great okay that 's our definition of a parallel line it 's a definition really of euclidean space but there is another possibility that you all know of : spherical space think of the surface of a sphere -- just like a beach ball the surface of the earth i have a straight line on my spherical surface and i have a point outside the line how many straight lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line what do we mean to talk about a straight line on a curved surface now mathematicians have answered that question they 've understood there is a generalized concept of straightness it 's called a geodesic and on the surface of a sphere a straight line is the biggest possible circle you can draw so it 's like the equator or the lines of longitude so we ask the question again " how many straight lines can i draw through the point but never meet the original line " does someone want to guess zero very good now mathematicians thought that was the only alternative it 's a bit suspicious is n't it there is two answers to the question so far zero and one two answers there may possibly be a third alternative to a mathematician if there are two answers and the first two are zero and one there is another number that immediately suggests itself as the third alternative does anyone want to guess what it is infinity you all got it right exactly there is there 's a third alternative this is what it looks like there 's a straight line and there is an infinite number of lines that go through the point and never meet the original line this is the drawing this nearly drove mathematicians bonkers because like you they 're sitting there feeling bamboozled thinking how can that be you 're cheating the lines are curved but that 's only because i 'm projecting it onto a flat surface mathematicians for several hundred years had to really struggle with this how could they see this what did it mean to actually have a physical model that looked like this it 's a bit like this : imagine that we 'd only ever encountered euclidean space then our mathematicians come along and said " there 's this thing called a sphere and the lines come together at the north and south pole " but you do n't know what a sphere looks like and someone that comes along and says " look here 's a ball " and you go " ah ! i can see it i can feel it i can touch it i can play with it " and that 's exactly what happened when daina taimina in 1997 showed that you could crochet models in hyperbolic space here is this diagram in crochetness i 've stitched euclid 's parallel postulate on to the surface and the lines look curved but look i can prove to you that they 're straight because i can take any one of these lines and i can fold along it and it 's a straight line so here in wool through a domestic feminine art is the proof that the most famous postulate in mathematics is wrong and you can stitch all sorts of mathematical theorems onto these surfaces the discovery of hyperbolic space ushered in the field of mathematics that is called non-euclidean geometry and this is actually the field of mathematics that underlies general relativity and is actually ultimately going to show us about the shape of the universe so there is this direct line between feminine handicraft euclid and general relativity now i said that mathematicians thought that this was impossible here 's two creatures who 've never heard of euclid 's parallel postulate -- did n't know it was impossible to violate and they 're simply getting on with it they 've been doing it for hundreds of millions of years i once asked the mathematicians why it was that mathematicians thought this structure was impossible when sea slugs have been doing it since the silurian age their answer was interesting they said " well i guess there are n't that many mathematicians sitting around looking at sea slugs " and that 's true but it also goes deeper than that it also says a whole lot of things about what mathematicians thought mathematics was what they thought it could and could n't do what they thought it could and could n't represent even mathematicians who in some sense are the freest of all thinkers literally could n't see not only the sea slugs around them but the lettuce on their plate -- because lettuces and all those curly vegetables they also are embodiments of hyperbolic geometry and so in some sense they literally they had such a symbolic view of mathematics they could n't actually see what was going on on the lettuce in front of them it turns out that the natural world is full of hyperbolic wonders and so too we 've discovered that there is an infinite taxonomy of crochet hyperbolic creatures we started out chrissy and i and our contributors doing the simple mathematically perfect models but we found that when we deviated from the specific setness of the mathematical code that underlies it -- the simple algorithm crochet three increase one -- when we deviated from that and made embellishments to the code the models immediately started to look more natural and all of our contributors who are an amazing collection of people around the world do their own embellishments as it were we have this ever-evolving crochet taxonomic tree of life just as the morphology and the complexity of life on earth is never ending little embellishments and complexifications in the dna code lead to new things like giraffes or orchids -- so too do little embellishments in the crochet code lead to new and wondrous creatures in the evolutionary tree of crochet life so this project really has taken on this inner organic life of its own there is the totality of all the people who have come to it and their individual visions and their engagement with this mathematical mode we have these technologies we use them but why what 's at stake here what does it matter for chrissy and i one of the things that 's important here is that these things suggest the importance and value of embodied knowledge we live in a society that completely tends to valorize symbolic forms of representation -- algebraic representations equations codes we live in a society that 's obsessed with presenting information in this way teaching information in this way but through this sort of modality crochet other plastic forms of play -- people can be engaged with the most abstract high-powered theoretical ideas the kinds of ideas that normally you have to go to university departments to study in higher mathematics which is where i first learned about hyperbolic space but you can do it through playing with material objects one of the ways that we 've come to think about this is that what we 're trying to do with the institute for figuring and projects like this we 're trying to have kindergarten for grown-ups and kindergarten was actually a very formalized system of education established by a man named friedrich froebel who was a crystallographer in the 19th century he believed that the crystal was the model for all kinds of representation he developed a radical alternative system of engaging the smallest children with the most abstract ideas through physical forms of play and he is worthy of an entire talk on his own right the value of education is something that froebel championed through plastic modes of play we live in a society now where we have lots of think tanks where great minds go to think about the world they write these great symbolic treatises called books and papers and op-ed articles we want to propose chrissy and i through the institute for figuring another alternative way of doing things which is the play tank and the play tank like the think tank is a place where people can go and engage with great ideas but what we want to propose is that the highest levels of abstraction things like mathematics computing logic etc -- all of this can be engaged with not just through purely cerebral algebraic symbolic methods but by literally physically playing with ideas thank you very much i 've been fascinated with crop diversity for about 35 years from now ever since i stumbled across a fairly obscure academic article by a guy named jack harlan and he described the diversity within crops -- all the different kinds of wheat and rice and such -- as a genetic resource and he said " this genetic resource " -- and i 'll never forget the words -- " stands between us and catastrophic starvation on a scale we can not imagine " i figured he was either really on to something or he was one of these academic nutcases so i looked a little further and what i figured out was that he was n't a nutcase he was the most respected scientist in the field what he understood was that biological diversity -- crop diversity -- is the biological foundation of agriculture it 's the raw material the stuff of evolution in our agricultural crops not a trivial matter and he also understood that that foundation was crumbling literally crumbling that indeed a mass extinction was underway in our fields in our agricultural system and that this mass extinction was taking place with very few people noticing and even fewer caring now i know that many of you do n't stop to think about diversity in agricultural systems and let 's face it that 's logical you do n't see it in the newspaper every day and when you go into the supermarket you certainly do n't see a lot of choices there you see apples that are red yellow and green and that 's about it so let me show you a picture of one form of diversity here 's some beans and there are about 35 or 40 different varieties of beans on this picture now imagine each one of these varieties as being distinct from another about the same way as a poodle from a great dane if i wanted to show you a picture of all the dog breeds in the world and i put 30 or 40 of them on a slide it would take about 10 slides because there about 400 breeds of dogs in the world but there are 35 to 40,000 different varieties of beans so if i were to going to show you all the beans in the world and i had a slide like this and i switched it every second it would take up my entire ted talk and i would n't have to say anything but the interesting thing is that this diversity -- and the tragic thing is -- that this diversity is being lost we have about 200,000 different varieties of wheat and we have about 2 to 400,000 different varieties of rice but it 's being lost and i want to give you an example of that it 's a bit of a personal example in fact in the united states in the 1800s -- that 's where we have the best data -- farmers and gardeners were growing 7,100 named varieties of apples imagine that 7,100 apples with names today 6,800 of those are extinct no longer to be seen again i used to have a list of these extinct apples and when i would go out and give a presentation i would pass the list out in the audience i would n't tell them what it was but it was in alphabetical order and i would tell them to look for their names their family names their mother 's maiden name and at the end of the speech i would ask " how many people have found a name " and i never had fewer than two-thirds of an audience hold up their hand and i said " you know what these apples come from your ancestors and your ancestors gave them the greatest honor they could give them they gave them their name the bad news is they 're extinct the good news is a third of you did n't hold up your hand your apple 's still out there find it make sure it does n't join the list " so i want to tell you that the piece of the good news is that the fowler apple is still out there and there 's an old book back here and i want to read a piece from it this book was published in 1904 it 's called " the apples of new york " and this is the second volume see we used to have a lot of apples and the fowler apple is described in here -- i hope this does n't surprise you -- as " a beautiful fruit " i do n't know if we named the apple or if the apple named us but â€¦ but to be honest the description goes on and it says that it " does n't rank high in quality however " and then he has to go even further it sounds like it was written by an old school teacher of mine " as grown in new york the fruit usually fails to develop properly in size and quality and is on the whole unsatisfactory " and i guess there 's a lesson to be learned here and the lesson is : so why save it i get this question all the time why do n't we just save the best one and there are a couple of answers to that question one thing is that there is no such thing as a best one today 's best variety is tomorrow 's lunch for insects or pests or disease the other thing is that maybe that fowler apple or maybe a variety of wheat that 's not economical right now has disease or pest resistance or some quality that we 're going to need for climate change that the others do n't so it 's not necessary thank god that the fowler apple is the best apple in the world it 's just necessary or interesting that it might have one good unique trait and for that reason we ought to be saving it why as a raw material as a trait we can use in the future think of diversity as giving us options and options of course are exactly what we need in an era of climate change i want to show you two slides but first i want to tell you that we 've been working at the global crop diversity trust with a number of scientists -- particularly at stanford and university of washington -- to ask the question : what 's going to happen to agriculture in an era of climate change and what kind of traits and characteristics do we need in our agricultural crops to be able to adapt to this in short the answer is that in the future in many countries the coldest growing seasons are going to be hotter than anything those crops have seen in the past the coldest growing seasons of the future hotter than the hottest of the past is agriculture adapted to that i do n't know can fish play the piano if agriculture has n't experienced that how could it be adapted now the highest concentration of poor and hungry people in the world and the place where climate change ironically is going to be the worst is in south asia and sub-saharan africa so i 've picked two examples here and i want to show you in the histogram before you now the blue bars represent the historical range of temperatures going back about far as we have temperature data and you can see that there 's some difference between one growing season and another some are colder some are hotter and it 's a bell shaped curve the tallest bar is the average temperature for the most number of growing seasons in the future later this century it 's going to look like the red totally out of bounds the agricultural system and more importantly the crops in the field in india have never experienced this before here 's south africa the same story but the most interesting thing about south africa is we do n't have to wait for 2070 for there to be trouble by 2030 if the maize or corn varieties which is the dominant crop -- 50 percent of the nutrition in southern africa are still in the field -- in 2030 we 'll have a 30 percent decrease in production of maize because of the climate change already in 2030 30 percent decrease of production in the context of increasing population that 's a food crisis it 's global in nature we will watch children starve to death on tv now you may say that 20 years is a long way off it 's two breeding cycles for maize we have two rolls of the dice to get this right we have to get climate-ready crops in the field and we have to do that rather quickly now the good news is that we have conserved we have collected and conserved a great deal of biological diversity agricultural diversity mostly in the form of seed and we put it in seed banks which is a fancy way of saying a freezer if you want to conserve seed for a long term and you want to make it available to plant breeders and researchers you dry it and then you freeze it unfortunately these seed banks are located around the world in buildings and they 're vulnerable disasters have happened in recent years we lost the gene bank the seed bank in iraq and afghanistan you can guess why in rwanda in the solomon islands and then there are just daily disasters that take place in these buildings financial problems and mismanagement and equipment failures and all kinds of things and every time something like this happens it means extinction we lose diversity and i 'm not talking about losing diversity in the same way that you lose your car keys i 'm talking about losing it in the same way that we lost the dinosaurs : actually losing it never to be seen again so a number of us got together and decided that you know enough is enough and we need to do something about that and we need to have a facility that can really offer protection for our biological diversity of -- maybe not the most charismatic diversity you do n't look in the eyes of a carrot seed quite in the way you do a panda bear but it 's very important diversity so we needed a really safe place and we went quite far north to find it to svalbard in fact this is above mainland norway you can see greenland there that 's at 78 degrees north it 's as far as you can fly on a regularly scheduled airplane it 's a remarkably beautiful landscape i ca n't even begin to describe it to you it 's otherworldly beautiful we worked with the norwegian government and with the norgen the norwegian genetic resources program to design this facility what you see is an artist 's conception of this facility which is built in a mountain in svalbard the idea of svalbard was that it 's cold so we get natural freezing temperatures but it 's remote it 's remote and accessible so it 's safe and we do n't depend on mechanical refrigeration this is more than just an artist 's dream it 's now a reality and this next picture shows it in context in svalbard and here 's the front door of this facility when you open up the front door this is what you 're looking at it 's pretty simple it 's a hole in the ground it 's a tunnel and you go into the tunnel chiseled in solid rock about 130 meters there are now a couple of security doors so you wo n't see it quite like this again when you get to the back you get into an area that 's really my favorite place i think of it as sort of a cathedral and i know that this tags me as a bit of a nerd but â€¦ some of the happiest days of my life have been spent â€¦ in this place there if you were to walk into one of these rooms you would see this it 's not very exciting but if you know what 's there it 's pretty emotional we have now about 425,000 samples of unique crop varieties there 's 70,000 samples of different varieties of rice in this facility right now about a year from now we 'll have over half a million samples we 're going up to over a million and someday we 'll basically have samples -- about 500 seeds -- of every variety of agricultural crop that can be stored in a frozen state in this facility this is a backup system for world agriculture it 's a backup system for all the seed banks storage is free it operates like a safety deposit box norway owns the mountain and the facility but the depositors own the seed and if anything happens then they can come back and get it this particular picture that you see shows the national collection of the united states of canada and an international institution from syria i think it 's interesting in that this facility i think is almost the only thing i can think of these days where countries literally every country in the world -- because we have seeds from every country in the world -- all the countries of the world have gotten together to do something that 's both long term sustainable and positive i ca n't think of anything else that 's happened in my lifetime that way i ca n't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a solution for climate change for the water crisis agriculture takes 70 percent of fresh water supplies on earth i ca n't look you in the eyes and tell you that there is such a solution for those things or the energy crisis or world hunger or peace in conflict i ca n't look you in the eyes and tell you that i have a simple solution for that but i can look you in the eyes and tell you that we ca n't solve any of those problems if we do n't have crop diversity because i challenge you to think of an effective efficient sustainable solution to climate change if we do n't have crop diversity because quite literally if agriculture does n't adapt to climate change neither will we and if crops do n't adapt to climate change neither will agriculture neither will we so this is not something pretty and nice to do there are a lot of people who would love to have this diversity exist just for the existence value of it it is i agree a nice thing to do but it 's a necessary thing to do so in a very real sense i believe that we as an international community should get organized to complete the task the svalbard global seed vault is a wonderful gift that norway and others have given us but it 's not the complete answer we need to collect the remaining diversity that 's out there we need to put it into good seed banks that can offer those seeds to researchers in the future we need to catalog it it 's a library of life but right now i would say we do n't have a card catalog for it and we need to support it financially my big idea would be that while we think of it as commonplace to endow an art museum or endow a chair at a university we really ought to be thinking about endowing wheat 30 million dollars in an endowment would take care of preserving all the diversity in wheat forever so we need to be thinking a little bit in those terms and my final thought is that we of course by conserving wheat rice potatoes and the other crops we may quite simply end up saving ourselves thank you this is a work in process based on some comments that were made at ted two years ago about the need for the storage of vaccine narrator : on this planet 1.6 billion people do n't have access to electricity refrigeration or stored fuels this is a problem it impacts : the spread of disease the storage of food and medicine and the quality of life so here 's the plan : inexpensive refrigeration that does n't use electricity propane gas kerosene or consumables time for some thermodynamics and the story of the intermittent absorption refrigerator adam grosser : so 29 years ago i had this thermo teacher who talked about absorption and refrigeration it 's one of those things that stuck in my head it was a lot like the stirling engine : it was cool but you did n't know what to do with it and it was invented in 1858 by this guy ferdinand carre but he could n't actually build anything with it because of the tools of the time this crazy canadian named powel crosley commercialized this thing called the icyball in 1928 and it was a really neat idea and i 'll get to why it did n't work but here 's how it works there 's two spheres and they 're separated in distance one has a working fluid water and ammonia and the other is a condenser you heat up one side the hot side the ammonia evaporates and it re-condenses in the other side you let it cool to room temperature and then as the ammonia re-evaporates and combines with the water back on the erstwhile hot side it creates a powerful cooling effect so it was a great idea that did n't work at all : it blew up because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong it topped 400 psi the ammonia was toxic it sprayed everywhere but it was kind of an interesting thought so the great thing about 2006 is there 's a lot of really great computational work you can do so we got the whole thermodynamics department at stanford involved -- a lot of computational fluid dynamics we proved that most of the ammonia refrigeration tables are wrong we found some non-toxic refrigerants that worked at very low vapor pressures brought in a team from the u.k. -- there 's a lot of great refrigeration people it turned out in the u.k. -- and built a test rig and proved that in fact we could make a low pressure non-toxic refrigerator so this is the way it works you put it on a cooking fire most people have cooking fires in the world whether it 's camel dung or wood it heats up for about 30 minutes cools for an hour put it into a container and it will refrigerate for 24 hours it looks like this this is the fifth prototype it 's not quite done weighs about eight pounds and this is the way it works you put it into a 15-liter vessel about three gallons and it 'll cool it down to just above freezing -- three degrees above freezing -- for 24 hours in a 30 degree c environment it 's really cheap we think we can build these in high volumes for about 25 dollars in low volumes for about 40 dollars and we think we can make refrigeration something that everybody can have thank you well good morning you know the computer and television both recently turned 60 and today i 'd like to talk about their relationship despite their middle age if you 've been following the themes of this conference or the entertainment industry it 's pretty clear that one has been picking on the other so it 's about time that we talked about how the computer ambushed television or why the invention of the atomic bomb unleashed forces that lead to the writers ' strike and it 's not just what these are doing to each other but it 's what the audience thinks that really frames this matter to get a sense of this and it 's been a theme we 've talked about all week i recently talked to a bunch of tweeners i wrote on cards : " television " " radio " " myspace " " internet " " pc " and i said just arrange these from what 's important to you and what 's not and then tell me why let 's listen to what happens when they get to the portion of the discussion on television girl 1 : well i think it 's important but like not necessary because you can do a lot of other stuff with your free time than watch programs peter hirshberg : which is more fun internet or tv girls : internet girl 2 : i think we -- the reasons one of the reasons we put computer before tv is because nowadays like we have tv shows on the computer girl 2 : and then you can download onto your ipod ph : would you like to be the president of a tv network girl 4 : i would n't like it girl 2 : that would be so stressful girl 5 : no ph : how come girl 5 : because they 're going to lose all their money eventually girl 3 : like the stock market it goes up and down and stuff i think right now the computers will be at the top and everything will be kind of going down and stuff ph : there 's been an uneasy relationship between the tv business and the tech business really ever since they both turned about 30 we go through periods of enthrallment followed by reactions in boardrooms in the finance community best characterized as what 's the finance term ick pooey let me give you an example of this the year is 1976 and warner buys atari because video games are on the rise the next year they march forward and they introduce qube the first interactive cable tv system and the new york times heralds this as telecommunications moving to the home convergence great things are happening everybody in the east coast gets in the pictures -- citicorp penney rca -- all getting into this big vision by the way this is about when i enter the picture i 'm going to do a summer internship at time warner that summer i 'm all -- i 'm at warner that summer -- i 'm all excited to work on convergence and then the bottom falls out does n't work out too well for them they lose money and i had a happy brush with convergence until kind of warner basically has to liquidate the whole thing that 's when i leave graduate school and i ca n't work in new york on kind of entertainment and technology because i have to be exiled to california where the remaining jobs are almost to the sea to go to work for apple computer warner of course writes off more than 400 million dollars four hundred million dollars which was real money back in the '70s but they were onto something and they got better at it by the year 2000 the process was perfected they merged with aol and in just four years managed to shed about 200 billion dollars of market capitalization showing that they 'd actually mastered the art of applying moore 's law of successive miniaturization to their balance sheet now i think that one reason that the media and the entertainment communities or the media community is driven so crazy by the tech community is that tech folks talk differently you know for 50 years we 've talked about changing the world about total transformation for 50 years it 's been about hopes and fears and promises of a better world and i got to thinking you know who else talks that way and the answer is pretty clearly -- it 's people in religion and in politics and so i realized that actually the tech world is best understood not as a business cycle but as a messianic movement we promise something great we evangelize it we 're going to change the world it does n't work out too well and so we actually go back to the well and start all over again as the people in new york and l.a. look on in absolute morbid astonishment but it 's this irrational view of things that drives us on to the next thing so what i 'd like to ask is if the computer is becoming a principal tool of media and entertainment how did we get here i mean how did a machine that was built for accounting and artillery morph into media of course the first computer was built just after world war ii to solve military problems but things got really interesting just a couple of years later -- 1949 with whirlwind built at mit 's lincoln lab jay forrester was building this for the navy but you ca n't help but see that the creator of this machine had in mind a machine that might actually be a potential media star so take a look at what happens when the foremost journalist of early television meets one of the foremost computer pioneers and the computer begins to express itself journalist : it 's a whirlwind electronic computer with considerable trepidation we undertake to interview this new machine jay forrester : hello new york this is cambridge and this is the oscilloscope of the whirlwind electronic computer would you like if i used the machine journalist : yes of course but i have an idea mr. forrester since this computer was made in conjunction with the office of naval research why do n't we switch down to the pentagon in washington and let the navy 's research chief admiral bolster give whirlwind the workout calvin bolster : well ed this problem concerns the navy 's viking rocket this rocket goes up 135 miles into the sky now at the standard rate of fuel consumption i would like to see the computer trace the flight path of this rocket and see how it can determine at any instant say at the end of 40 seconds the amount of fuel remaining and the velocity at that set instant jf : over on the left-hand side you will notice fuel consumption decreasing as the rocket takes off and on the right-hand side there 's a scale that shows the rocket 's velocity the rocket 's position is shown by the trajectory that we 're now looking at and as it reaches the peak of its trajectory the velocity you will notice has dropped off to a minimum then as the rocket dives down velocity picks up again toward a maximum velocity and the rocket hits the ground how 's that journalist : what about that admiral cb : looks very good to me jf : and before leaving we would like to show you another kind of mathematical problem that some of the boys have worked out in their spare time in a less serious vein for a sunday afternoon journalist : thank you very much indeed mr. forrester and the mit lab ph : you know so much was worked out : the first real-time interaction the video display pointing a gun it lead to the microcomputer but unfortunately it was too pricey for the navy and all of this would have been lost if it were n't for a happy coincidence enter the atomic bomb we 're threatened by the greatest weapon ever and knowing a good thing when it sees it the air force decides it needs the biggest computer ever to protect us they adapt whirlwind to a massive air defense system deploy it all across the frozen north and spend nearly three times as much on this computer as was spent on the manhattan project building the a-bomb in the first place talk about a shot in the arm for the computer industry and you can imagine that the air force became a pretty good salesman here 's their marketing video narrator : in a mass raid high-speed bombers could be in on us before we could determine their tracks and then it would be too late to act we can not afford to take that chance it is to meet this threat that the air force has been developing sage the semi-automatic ground environment system to strengthen our air defenses this new computer built to become the nerve center of a defense network is able to perform all the complex mathematical problems involved in countering a mass enemy raid it is provided with its own powerhouse containing large diesel-driven generators air-conditioning equipment and cooling towers required to cool the thousands of vacuum tubes in the computer ph : you know that one computer was huge there 's an interesting marketing lesson from it which is basically when you market a product you can either say this is going to be wonderful it will make you feel better and enliven you or there 's one other marketing proposition : if you do n't use our product you 'll die this is a really good example of that this had the first pointing device it was distributed so it worked out -- distributed computing and modems -- so all these things could talk to each other about 20 percent of all the nation 's programmers were wrapped up in this thing and it led to an awful lot of what we have today it also used vacuum tubes you saw how huge it was and to give you a sense for this -- because we 've talked a lot about moore 's law and making things small at this conference so let 's talk about making things large if we took whirlwind and put it in a place that you all know say century city it would fit beautifully you 'd kind of have to take century city out but it could fit in there but like let 's imagine we took the latest pentium processor the latest core 2 extreme which is a four-core processor that intel 's working on it will be our laptop tomorrow to build that what we 'd do with whirlwind technology is we 'd have to take up roughly from the 10 to mulholland and from the 405 to la cienega just with those whirlwinds and then the 92 nuclear power plants that it would take to provide the power would fill up the rest of los angeles that 's roughly a third more nuclear power than all of france creates so the next time they tell you they 're on to something clearly they 're not so -- and we have n't even worked out the cooling needs but it gives you the kind of power that people have that the audience has and the reasons these transformations are happening all of this stuff starts moving into industry dec kind of reduces all this and makes the first mini-computer it shows up at places like mit and then a mutation happens spacewar ! is built the first computer game and all of a sudden interactivity and involvement and passion is worked out actually many mit students stayed up all night long working on this thing and many of the principles of gaming today were worked out dec knew a good thing about wasting time it shipped every one of its computers with that game meanwhile as all of this is happening by the mid-'50s the business model of traditional broadcasting and cinema has been busted completely a new technology has confounded radio men and movie moguls and they 're quite certain that television is about to do them in in fact despair is in the air and a quote that sounds largely reminiscent from everything i 've been reading all week rca had david sarnoff who basically commercialized radio said this " i do n't say that radio networks must die every effort has been made and will continue to be made to find a new pattern new selling arrangements and new types of programs that may arrest the declining revenues it may yet be possible to eke out a poor existence for radio but i do n't know how " and of course as the computer industry develops interactively producers in the emerging tv business actually hit on the same idea and they fake it jack berry : boys and girls i think you all know how to get your magic windows up on the set you just get them out first of all get your winky dink kits out put out your magic window and your erasing glove and rub it like this that 's the way we get some of the magic into it boys and girls then take it and put it right up against the screen of your own television set and rub it out from the center to the corners like this make sure you keep your magic crayons handy your winky dink crayons and your erasing glove because you 'll be using them during the show to draw like that you all set ok let 's get right to the first story about dusty man come on into the secret lab ph : it was the dawn of interactive tv and you may have noticed they wanted to sell you the winky dink kits those are the winky dink crayons i know what you 're saying " pete i could use any ordinary open-source crayon why do i have to buy theirs " i assure you that 's not the case turns out they told us directly that these are the only crayons you should ever use with your winky dink magic window other crayons may discolor or hurt the window this proprietary principle of vendor lock-in would go on to be perfected with great success as one of the enduring principles of windowing systems everywhere it led to lawsuits -- -- federal investigations and lots of repercussions and that 's a scandal we wo n't discuss today but we will discuss this scandal because this man jack berry the host of " winky dink " went on to become the host of " twenty one " one of the most important quiz shows ever and it was rigged and it became unraveled when this man charles van doren was outed after an unnatural winning streak ending berry 's career and actually ending the career of a lot of people at cbs it turns out there was a lot to learn about how this new medium worked and 50 years ago if you 'd been at a meeting like this and were trying to understand the media there was one prophet and only but one you wanted to hear from professor marshall mcluhan he actually understood something about a theme that we 've been discussing all week it 's the role of the audience in an era of pervasive electronic communications here he is talking from the 1960s marshall mcluhan : if the audience can become involved in the actual process of making the ad then it 's happy it 's like the old quiz shows they were great tv because it gave the audience a role something to do they were horrified when they discovered they 'd really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged now then this was a horrible misunderstanding of tv on the part of the programmers ph : you know mcluhan talked about the global village if you substitute the word blogosphere of the internet today it is very true that his understanding is probably very enlightening now let 's listen in to him mm : the global village is a world in which you do n't necessarily have harmony you have extreme concern with everybody else 's business and much involvement in everybody else 's life it 's a sort of ann landers ' column writ large and it does n't necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else 's affairs and so the global village is as big as a planet and as small as a village post office ph : we 'll talk a little bit more about him later we 're now right into the 1960s it 's the era of big business and data centers for computing but all that was about to change you know the expression of technology reflects the people and the time of the culture it was built in and when i say that code expresses our hopes and aspirations it 's not just a joke about messianism it 's actually what we do but for this part of the story i 'd actually like to throw it to america 's leading technology correspondent john markoff john markoff : do you want to know what the counterculture in drugs sex rock 'n ' roll and the anti-war movement had to do with computing everything it all happened within five miles of where i 'm standing at stanford university between 1960 and 1975 in the midst of revolution in the streets and rock and roll concerts in the parks a group of researchers led by people like john mccarthy a computer scientist at the stanford artificial intelligence lab and doug engelbart a computer scientist at sri changed the world engelbart came out of a pretty dry engineering culture but while he was beginning to do his work all of this stuff was bubbling on the mid-peninsula there was lsd leaking out of kesey 's veterans ' hospital experiments and other areas around the campus and there was music literally in the streets the grateful dead was playing in the pizza parlors people were leaving to go back to the land there was the vietnam war there was black liberation there was women 's liberation this was a remarkable place at a remarkable time and into that ferment came the microprocessor i think it was that interaction that led to personal computing they saw these tools that were controlled by the establishment as ones that could actually be liberated and put to use by these communities that they were trying to build and most importantly they had this ethos of sharing information i think these ideas are difficult to understand because when you 're trapped in one paradigm the next paradigm is always like a science fiction universe -- it makes no sense the stories were so compelling that i decided to write a book about them the title of the book is " what the dormouse said : how the '60s counterculture shaped the personal computer industry " the title was taken from the lyrics to a jefferson airplane song the lyrics go " remember what the dormouse said feed your head feed your head feed your head " ph : by this time computing had kind of leapt into media territory and in short order much of what we 're doing today was imagined in cambridge and silicon valley here 's the architecture machine group the predecessor of the media lab in 1981 meanwhile in california we were trying to commercialize a lot of this stuff hypercard was the first program to introduce the public to hyperlinks where you could randomly hook to any kind of picture or piece of text or data across a file system and we had no way of explaining it there was no metaphor was it a database a prototyping tool a scripted language heck it was everything so we ended up writing a marketing brochure we asked a question about how the mind works and we let our customers play the role of so many blind men filling out the elephant a few years later we then hit on the idea of explaining to people the secret of how do you get the content you want the way you want it and the easy way here 's the apple marketing video james burke : you 'll be pleased to know i 'm sure that there are several ways to create a hypercard interactive video the most involved method is to go ahead and produce your own videodisc as well as build your own hypercard stacks by far the simplest method is to buy a pre-made videodisc and hypercard stacks from a commercial supplier the method we illustrate in this video uses a pre-made videodisc but creates custom hypercard stacks this method allows you to use existing videodisc materials in ways which suit your specific needs and interests ph : i hope you realize how subversive that is that 's like a dick cheney speech you think he 's a nice balding guy but he 's just declared war on the content business find the commercial stuff mash it up tell the story your way now as long as we confine this to the education market and a personal matter between the computer and the file system that 's fine but as you can see it was about to leap out and upset jack valenti and a lot of other people by the way speaking of the filing system it never occurred to us that these hyperlinks could go beyond the local area network a few years later tim berners-lee worked that out it became a killer app of links and today of course we call that the world wide web now not only was i instrumental in helping apple miss the internet but a couple of years later i helped bill gates do the same thing the year is 1993 and he was working on a book and i was working on a video to help him kind of explain where we were all heading and how to popularize all this we were plenty aware that we were messing with media and on the surface it looks like we predicted a lot of the right things but we also missed an awful lot let 's take a look narrator : the pyramids the colosseum the new york subway system and tv dinners ancient and modern wonders of the man-made world all yet each pales to insignificance with the completion of that magnificent accomplishment of twenty-first-century technology the digital superhighway once it was only a dream of technoids and a few long-forgotten politicians the digital highway arrived in america 's living rooms late in the twentieth century let us recall the pioneers who made this technical marvel possible the digital highway would follow the rutted trail first blazed by alexander graham bell though some were incredulous â€¦ man 1 : the phone company ! narrator : stirred by the prospects of mass communication and making big bucks on advertising david sarnoff commercializes radio man 2 : never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand narrator : the medium introduced america to new products voice 1 : say mom windows for radio means more enjoyment and greater ease of use for the whole family be sure to enjoy windows for radio at home and at work narrator : in 1939 the radio corporation of america introduced television man 2 : never had scientists been put under such pressure and demand narrator : eventually the race to the future took on added momentum with the breakup of the telephone company and further stimulus came with the deregulation of the cable television industry and the re-regulation of the cable television industry ted turner : we did the work to build this this cable industry now the broadcasters want some of our money i mean it 's ridiculous narrator : computers once the unwieldy tools of accountants and other geeks escaped the backrooms to enter the media fracas the world and all its culture reduced to bits the lingua franca of all media and the forces of convergence exploded finally four great industrial sectors combined telecommunications entertainment computing and everything else man 3 : we 'll see channels for the gourmet and we 'll see channels for the pet lover voice 2 : next on the gourmet pet channel decorating birthday cakes for your schnauzer narrator : all of industry was in play as investors flocked to place their bets at stake : the battle for you the consumer and the right to spend billions to send a lot of information into the parlors of america ph : we missed a lot you know you missed we missed the internet the long tail the role of the audience open systems social networks it just goes to show how tough it is to come up with the right uses of media thomas edison had the same problem he wrote a list of what the phonograph might be good for when he invented it and kind of only one of his ideas turned out to have been the right early idea well you know where we 're going on from here we come into the era of the dotcom the world wide web and i do n't need to tell you about that because we all went through that bubble together but when we emerge from this and what we call web 2.0 things actually are quite different and i think it 's the reason that tv 's so challenged if internet one was about pages now it 's about people it 's a customer it 's an audience it 's a person who 's participating it 's the formidable thing that is changing entertainment now mm : because it gave the audience a role something to do ph : in my own company technorati we see something like 67,000 blog posts an hour come in that 's about 2,700 fresh connective links across about 112 million blogs that are out there and it 's no wonder that as we head into the writers ' strike odd things happen you know it reminds me of that old saw in hollywood that a producer is anyone who knows a writer i now think a network boss is anyone who has a cable modem but it 's not a joke this is a real headline " websites attract striking writers : operators of sites like mydamnchannel.com could benefit from labor disputes " meanwhile you have the tv bloggers going out on strike in sympathy with the television writers and then you have tv guide a fox property which is about to sponsor the online video awards -- but cancels it out of sympathy with traditional television not appearing to gloat to show you how schizophrenic this all is here 's the head of myspace or fox interactive a news corp company being asked well with the writers ' strike is n't this going to hurt news corp and help you online man : but i yeah i think there 's an opportunity as the strike continues there 's an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like myspace tv ph : oh but then he remembers he works for rupert murdoch man : yes well first you know i 'm part of news corporation as part of fox entertainment group obviously we hope that the strike is -- that the issues are resolved as quickly as possible ph : one of the great things that 's going on here is the globalization of content really is happening here is a clip from a video from a piece of animation that was written by a writer in hollywood animation worked out in israel farmed out to croatia and india and it 's now an international series narrator : the following takes place between the minutes of 2:15 p.m. and 2:18 p.m. in the months preceding the presidential primaries voice 1 : you 'll have to stay here in the safe house until we get word the terrorist threat is over voice 2 : you mean we 'll have to live here together voice 2 : well there goes the neighborhood ph : the company that created this aniboom is an interesting example of where this is headed traditional tv animation costs say between 80,000 and 10,000 dollars a minute they 're producing things for between 1,500 and 800 dollars a minute and they 're offering their creators 30 percent of the back end in a much more entrepreneurial manner so it 's a different model what the entertainment business is struggling with the world of brands is figuring out for example nike now understands that nike plus is not just a device in its shoe it 's a network to hook its customers together and the head of marketing at nike says " people are coming to our site an average of three times a week we do n't have to go to them " which means television advertising is down 57 percent for nike or as nike 's head of marketing says " we 're not in the business of keeping media companies alive we 're in the business of connecting with consumers " and media companies realize the audience is important also here 's a man announcing the new market watch from dow jones powered 100 percent by the user experience on the home page -- user-generated content married up with traditional content it turns out you have a bigger audience and more interest if you hook up with them or as geoffrey moore once told me it 's intellectual curiosity that 's the trade that brands need in the age of the blogosphere and i think this is beginning to happen in the entertainment business one of my heroes is songwriter ally willis who just wrote " the color purple " and has been an r and -- rhythm and blues writer and this is what she said about where songwriting 's going ally willis : where millions of collaborators wanted the song because to look at them strictly as spam is missing what this medium is about ph : so to wrap up i 'd love to throw it back to marshall mcluhan who 40 years ago was dealing with audiences that were going through just as much change and i think that today traditional hollywood and the writers are framing this perhaps in the way that it was being framed before but i do n't need to tell you this let 's throw it back to him narrator : we are in the middle of a tremendous clash between the old and the new mm : the medium does things to people and they are always completely unaware of this they do n't really notice the new medium that is wrapping them up they think of the old medium because the old medium is always the content of the new medium as movies tend to be the content of tv and as books used to be the content novels used to be the content of movies and so every time a new medium arrives the old medium is the content and it is highly observable highly noticeable but the real real roughing up and massaging is done by the new medium and it is ignored ph : i think it 's a great time of enthrallment there 's been more raw dna of communications and media thrown out there content is moving from shows to particles that are batted back and forth and part of social communications and i think this is going to be a time of great renaissance and opportunity and whereas television may have gotten beat up what 's getting built is a really exciting new form of communication and we kind of have the merger of the two industries and a new way of thinking to look at it thanks very much i was listed on the online biography that said i was a design missionary that 's a bit lofty ; i 'm really more of something like a street walker i spend a lot of time in urban areas looking for design and studying design in the public sector i take about 5,000 photographs a year and i thought that i would edit from these and try to come up with some images that might be appropriate and interesting to you and i used three criteria : the first was i thought i 'd talk about real design within reach design that 's free not design not quite within reach as we 're fondly known by our competition and competitors but stuff that you can find on the streets stuff that was free stuff that was available to all people and stuff that probably contains some other important messages i 'll use these sidewalks in rio as an example a very common public design done in the '50s it 's got a nice kind of flowing organic form very consistent with the brazilian culture -- i think good design adds to culture wholly inconsistent with san francisco or new york but i think these are my sort of information highways : i live in much more of an analog world where pedestrian traffic and interaction and diversity exchange and where i think the simple things under our feet have a great amount of meaning to us how did i get started in this business i was a ceramic designer for about 10 years and just loved utilitarian form -- simple things that we use every day little compositions of color and surface on form this led me to starting a company called design within reach a company dealing with simple forms making good designers available to us and also selling the personalities and character of the designers as well and it seems to have worked a couple of years into the process i spent a lot of time in europe traveling around looking for design and i had a bit of a wake-up call in amsterdam : i was there going into the design stores and mixing with our crowd of designers and i recognized that a whole lot of stuff pretty much looked the same and the effect of globalization has had that in our community also we know a lot about what 's going on with design around the world and it 's getting increasingly more difficult to find design that reflects a unique culture i was walking around on the streets of amsterdam and i recognized you know the big story from amsterdam is n't what 's in the design stores it 's what 's out on the streets and maybe it 's self-explanatory but a city that has n't been taken over by modernism that 's preserved its kind of architecture and character and where the bicycle plays an important part of the way in which people get around and where pedestrian rights are protected and i write a newsletter that goes out every week and i wrote an article about this and it got such enormous response that i realized that design that common design that 's in the public area means a lot to people and establishes kind of a groundwork and a dialog i then kind of thought about the other cities in europe where i spend a lot of time looking for design like basel where vitra is located or in northern italy -- all cities where there are a whole lot of bicycles and where pedestrian areas -- and i came to the conclusion that perhaps there was something about these important design centers that dealt with bicycles and foot traffic and i 'm sure the skeptic eye would say no the correlation there is that there are universities and schools where people ca n't afford cars but it did seem that in many of these areas pedestrian traffic was protected you would n't look at this and call this a designer bike : a designer bike is made of titanium or molybdenum but i began looking at design in a place like amsterdam and recognized you know the first job of design is to serve a social purpose and so i look at this bike as not being a designer bike but being a very good example of design and since that time in amsterdam i spent an increasing amount of time in the cities looking at design for common evidence of design that really is n't under so much of a designer 's signature i was in buenos aires very recently and i went to see this bridge by santiago calatrava he 's a spanish architect and designer and the tourist brochures pointed me in the direction of this bridge -- i love bridges metaphorically and symbolically and structurally -- and it was a bit of a disappointment because of the sludge from the river was encrusted on it ; it really was n't in use and i recognized that oftentimes design when you 're set up to see design it can be a bit of a letdown but there were lots of other things going on in this area : it was a kind of construction zone ; a lot of buildings were going up and approaching a building from a distance you do n't see too much ; you get a little closer and you arrive at a nice little composition that might remind you of a mondrian or a diebenkorn or something but to me it was an example of industrial materials with a little bit of colors and animation and a nice little still life -- kind of unintended piece of design and going a little closer you get a different perspective i find these little vignettes these little accidental pieces of design to be refreshing they give me i do n't know a sense of correctness in the world and some visual delight in the knowledge that the building will probably never look as good as this simple industrial scaffolding that is there to serve down the road there was another building a nice visual structure : horizontal vertical elements little decorative lines going across these magenta squiggles the workmen being reduced to decorative elements just a nice kind of breakup of the urban place and you know that no longer exists you 've captured it for a moment and finding this little still life 's like listening to little songs or something : it gives me an enormous amount of pleasure antoine predock designed a wonderful ball stadium in san diego called petco park a terrific use of local materials but inside you could find some interior compositions some people go to baseball stadiums to look at games ; i go and see design relationships just a wonderful kind of breakup of architecture and the way that the trees form vertical elements red is a color in the landscape that is often on stop signs it takes your attention ; it has a great amount of emotion ; it stares back at you the way that a figure might just a piece of barrier tape construction stuff in italy construction site in new york : red having this kind of emotional power that 's almost an equivalent with the way in which -- cuteness of puppies and such side street in italy red drew me into this little composition optimistic to me in the sense that maybe the public service 's mailbox door service plumbing it looks as if these different public services work together to create some nice little compositions in italy you know almost everything kind of looks good simple menus put on a board achieving kind of the sort of balance but i 'm convinced that it 's because you 're walking around the streets and seeing things red can be comical : it can draw your attention to the poor little personality of the little fire hydrant suffering from bad civic planning in havana color can animate simple blocks simple materials : walking in new york i 'll stop i do n't always know why i take photographs of things a nice visual composition of symmetry curves against sharp things it 's a comment on the way in which we deal with public seating in the city of new york i 've come across some other just kind of curious relationships of bollards on the street that have different interpretations but -- these things amuse me sometimes a trash can -- this is just in the street in san francisco -- a trash can that 's been left there for 18 months creates a nice 45-degree angle against these other relationships and turns a common parking spot into a nice little piece of sculpture so there 's this sort of silent hand of design at work that i see in places that i go havana is a wonderful area it 's quite free of commercial clutter : you do n't see our logos and brands and names and therefore you 're alert to things physically and this is a great protection of a pedestrian zone and the repurposing of some colonial cannons to do that and cuba needs to be far more resourceful because of the blockades and things but a really wonderful playground i 've often wondered why italy is really a leader in modern design in our area in furnishings they 're sort of way at the top the dutch are good also but the italians are good and i came across this little street in venice where the communist headquarters were sharing a wall with this catholic shrine and i realized that you know italy is a place where they can accept these different ideologies and deal with diversity and not have the problem or they can choose to ignore them but these -- you do n't have warring factions and i think that maybe the tolerance of the absurdity which has made italy so innovative and so tolerant the past and the present work quite well together in italy also and i think that it 's recognizable there and has an important effect on culture because their public spaces are protected their sidewalks are protected and you 're actually able to confront these things physically and i think this helps people get over their fear of modernism and other such things a change might be a typical street corner in san francisco and i use this -- this is sort of what i consider to be urban spam i notice this stuff because i walk a lot but here private industry is really kind of making a mess of the public sector and as i look at it i sort of say you know the publications that report on problems in the urban area also contribute to it and it 's just my call to say to all of us public policy wo n't change this at all ; private industry has to work to take things like this seriously the extreme might be in italy where again there 's kind of some type of control over what 's happening in the environment is very evident even in the way that they sell and distribute periodicals i walk to work every day or ride my scooter and i come down and park in this little spot and i came down one day and all the bikes were red now this is not going to impress you guys who photoshop and can do stuff but this was an actual moment when i got off my bike and i looked and i thought it 's as if all of my biker brethren had kind of gotten together and conspired to make a little statement and it reminded me that -- to keep in the present to look out for these kinds of things it gave me possibilities for wonder -- if maybe it 's a yellow day in san francisco and we could all agree and create some installations but it also reminded me of the power of pattern and repetition to make an effect in our mind and i do n't know if there 's a stronger kind of effect than pattern and the way it unites kind of disparate elements i was at the art show in miami in december and spent a couple of hours looking at fine art and amazed at the prices of art and how expensive it is but having a great time looking at it and i came outside and the valets for this car service had created you know quite a nice little collage of these car keys and my closest equivalent were a group of prayer tags that i had seen in tokyo and i thought that if pattern can unite these disparate elements it can do just about anything i do n't have very many shots of people because they kind of get in the way of studying pure form i was in a small restaurant in spain having lunch -- one of those nice days where you had the place kind of to yourself and you have a glass of wine and enjoying the local area and the culture and the food and the quiet and feeling very lucky and a bus load of tourists arrived emptied out filled up the restaurant in a very short period of time completely changed the atmosphere and character with loud voices and large bodies and such and we had to get up and leave ; it was just that uncomfortable and at that moment the sun came out and through this perforated screen a pattern was cast over these bodies and they kind of faded into the rear and we left the restaurant kind of feeling o.k about stuff and i do think pattern has the capability of eradicating some of the most evil forces of society such as bad form in restaurants but quite seriously it was a statement to me that one thing that you do sort of see is the aggressive nature of the industrial world has produced -- kind of large masses of things and when you -- in monoculture and i think the preservation of diversity in culture is something that 's important to us the last shots that i have deal with -- coming back to this theme of sidewalks and i wanted to say something here about -- i 'm kind of optimistic you know post-second world war the influence of the automobile has really been devastating in a lot of our cities a lot of urban areas have been converted into parking lots in a sort of indiscriminate use a lot of the planning departments became subordinated to the transportation department it 's as easy to rag on cars as it is on wal-mart ; i 'm not going to do that but they 're real examples in urbanization and the change that 's occurred in the last number of years and the heightened sensitivity to the importance of our urban environments as cultural centers i think that they are that the statements that we make in this public sector are our contributions to a larger whole cities are the place where we 're most likely to encounter diversity and to mix with other people we go there for stimulation in art and all those other things but i think people have recognized the sanctity of our urban areas a place like chicago has really reached kind of a level of international stature the u.s. is actually becoming a bit of a leader in kind of enlightened urban planning and renewal and i want to single out a place like chicago where i look at some guy like mayor daley as a bit of a design hero for being able to work through the political processes and all that to improve an area you would expect a city like this to have upgraded flower boxes on michigan avenue where wealthy people shop but if you actually go along the street you find the flower boxes change from street to street : there 's actual diversity in the plants and the idea that a city group can maintain different types of foliage is really quite exceptional there are common elements of this that you 'll see throughout chicago and then there are your big-d design statements : the pritzker pavilion done by frank gehry my measure of this as being an important bit of design is not so much the way that it looks but the fact that it performs a very important social function there are a lot of free concerts for example that go on in this area ; it has a phenomenal acoustic system but the commitment that the city has made to the public area is significant and almost an international model i work on the mayor 's council in san francisco on the international design council for mayors and chicago is looked at as the pinnacle and i really would like to salute mayor daley and the folks there i thought that i should include at least one shot of technology for you guys this is also in millennium park in chicago where the spanish artist-designer plensa has created kind of a digital readout in this park that reflects back the characters and personalities of the people in this area and it 's a welcoming area i think inclusive of diversity reflective of diversity and i think this marriage of both technology and art in the public sector is an area where the u.s. can really take a leadership role and chicago is one example thank you very much when i was five years old i fell in love with airplanes now i 'm talking about the '30s in the '30s an airplane had two wings and a round motor and was always flown by a guy who looked like cary grant he had high leather boots jodhpurs an old leather jacket a wonderful helmet and those marvelous goggles -- and inevitably a white scarf to flow in the wind he 'd always walk up to his airplane in a kind of saunter devil-may-care saunter flick the cigarette away grab the girl waiting here give her a kiss and then mount his airplane maybe for the last time of course i always wondered what would happen if he 'd kissed the airplane first but this was real romance to me everything about flying in those years which was -- you have to stop and think for a moment -- was probably the most advanced technological thing going on at the time so as a youngster i tried to get close to this by drawing airplanes constantly drawing airplanes it 's the way i got a part of this romance and of course in a way when i say romance i mean in part the aesthetics of that whole situation i think the word is the holistic experience revolving around a product the product was that airplane but it built a romance even the parts of the airplane had french names ze fuselage ze empanage ze nessal you know from a romance language so that it was something that just got into your spirit it did mine and i decided i had to get closer than just drawing fantasy airplanes i wanted to build airplanes so i built model airplanes and i found that in doing the model airplanes the appearance drawings were not enough you could n't transfer those to the model itself if you wanted it to fly you had to learn the discipline of flying you had to learn about aeronautics you had to learn what made an airplane stay in the air and of course as a model in those years you could n't control it so it had to be self-righting and stay up without crashing so i had to give up the approach of drawing the fantasy shapes and convert it to technical drawings -- the shape of the wing the shape of the fuselage and so on -- and build an airplane over these drawings that i knew followed some of the principles of flying and in so doing i could produce a model that would fly stay in the air and it had once it was in the air some of this romance that i was in love with well the act of drawing airplanes led me to when i had the opportunity to choose a course in school led me to sign up for aeronautical engineering and when i was sitting in classes -- in which no one asked me to draw an airplane -- to my surprise i had to learn mathematics and mechanics and all this sort of thing i 'd wile away my time drawing airplanes in the class one day a young man looked over my shoulder he said " you draw very well you should be in the art department " and i said " why " and he said " well for one thing there are more girls there " so my romance was temporarily shifted and i went into art because they appreciated drawing studied painting ; did n't do very well at that went through design some architecture eventually hired myself out as a designer and for the following 25 years living in italy living in america i doled out a piece of this romance to anybody who 'd pay for it -- this sense this aesthetic feeling for the experience revolving around a designed object and it exists any of you who rode the automobiles -- was it yesterday -- at the track you know the romance revolving around those high performance cars well in 25 years i was mostly putting out pieces of this romance and not getting a lot back in because design on call does n't always connect you with a circumstance in which you can produce things of this nature so after 25 years i began to feel as though i was running dry and i quit and i started up a very small operation -- went from 40 people to one in an effort to rediscover my innocence i wanted to get back where the romance was and i could n't choose airplanes because they had gotten sort of unromantic at that point even though i 'd done a lot of airplane work on the interiors so i chose furniture and i chose chairs specifically because i knew something about them i 'd designed a lot of chairs over the years for tractors and trucks and submarines -- all kinds of things but not office chairs so i started doing that and i found that there were ways to duplicate the same approach that i used to use on the airplane only this time instead of the product being shaped by the wind it was shaped by the human body so the discipline was -- as in the airplane you learn a lot about how to deal with the air for a chair you have to learn a lot about how to deal with the body and what the body needs wants indicates it needs and that 's the way ultimately after some ups and downs i ended up designing the chair i 'm going to show you i should say one more thing when i was doing those model airplanes i did everything i conceived the kind of airplane i basically engineered it i built it and i flew it and that 's the way i work now when i started this chair it was not a preconceived notion design nowadays if you mean it you do n't start with styling sketches i started with a lot of loose ideas roughly eight or nine years ago and the loose ideas had something to do with what i knew happened with people in the office at the work place -- people who worked and used task seating a great many of them sitting in front of a computer all day long and i felt the one thing they do n't need is a chair that interferes with their main reason for sitting there so i took the approach that the chair should do as much for them as humanly possible or as mechanistically possible so that they did n't have to fuss with it so my idea was that instead of sitting down and reaching for a lot of controls that you would sit on the chair and it would automatically balance your weight against the force required to recline now that may not mean a lot to some of you but you know most good chairs do recline because it 's beneficial to open up this joint between your legs and your upper body for better breathing and better flow so that if you sit down on my chair whether you 're five feet tall or six foot six it always deals with your weight and transfers the amount of force required to recline in a way that you do n't have to look for something to adjust i 'll tell you right up front this is a trade off there are drawbacks to this one is : you ca n't accommodate everybody there are some very light people some extremely heavy people maybe people with a lot of bulk up top they begin to fall off the end of your chart but the compromise i felt was in my favor because most people do n't adjust their chairs they will sit in them forever i had somebody on the bus out to the racetrack tell me about his sister calling him he said she had one of the new better chairs she said " oh i love it " she said " but it 's too high " so he said " well i 'll come over and look at it " he came over and looked at it he reached down he pulled a lever and the chair sank down she said " oh it 's wonderful how did you do that " and he showed her the lever well that 's typical of a lot of us working in chairs and why should you get a 20-page manual about how to run a chair i had one for a wristwatch once 20 pages anyway i felt that it was important that you did n't have to make an adjustment in order to get this kind of action the other thing i felt was that armrests had never really been properly approached from the standpoint of how much of an aid they could be to your work life but i felt it was too much to ask to have to adjust each individual armrest in order to get it where you wanted so i spent a long time i said i worked eight or nine years on it and each of these things went along sort of in parallel but incrementally were a problem of their own i worked a long time on figuring out how to move the arms over a much greater arc -- that is up and down -- and make them a lot easier so that you did n't have to use a button and so after many trials many failures we came up with a very simple arrangement in which we could just move one arm or the other and they go up easily and stop where you want you can put them down essentially out of the way no arms at all or you can pull them up where you want them and this was another thing that i felt while not nearly as romantic as cary grant nevertheless begins to grab a little bit of aesthetic operation aesthetic performance into a product the next area that was of interest to me was the fact that reclining was a very important factor and the more you can recline in a way the better it is the more the angle between here and here opens up -- and nowadays with a screen in front of you you do n't want to have your eye drop too far in the recline so we keep it at more or less the same level -- but you transfer weight off your tailbones would everybody put their hand under their bottom and feel their tailbone you feel that bone under there just your own there 's two of them one on either side all the weight of your upper torso -- your arms your head -- goes right down through your back your spine into those bones when you sit and that 's a lot of load just relieving your arms with armrests takes 20 percent of that load off now that if your spine is not held in a good position will help bend your spine the wrong way and so on so to unload that great weight -- if that indeed exists -- you can recline when you recline you take away a lot of that load off your bottom end and transfer it to your back at the same time as i say you open up this joint and breathability is good but to do that if you have any amount of recline it gets to the point where you need a headrest because nearly always automatically hold your head in a vertical position see as i recline my head says more or less vertical well if you 're reclined a great deal you have to use muscle force to hold your head there so that 's where a headrest comes in now headrest is a challenge because you want it to adjust enough so that it 'll fit you know a tall guy and a short girl so here we are i 've got five inches of adjustment here in order to get the headrest in the right place but then i knew from experience and looking around in offices where there were chairs with headrests that nobody would ever bother to reach back and turn a knob and adjust the headrest to put it in position and you need it in a different position when you 're upright then when you 're reclined so i knew that had to be solved and had to be automatic so if you watch this chair as i recline the headrest comes up to meet my neck ideally you want to put the head support in the cranial area right there so that part of it took a long time to work out and there is a variety of other things : the shape of the cushions the gel we put we stole the idea from bicycle seats and put gel in the cushions and in the armrests to absorb point load -- distributes the loading so you do n't get hard spots you cant hit your elbow on bottom and i did want to demonstrate the fact that the chair can accommodate people while you 're sitting in it you can adjust it down for the five-footer or you can adjust it for the six-foot-six guy -- all within the scope of a few simple adjustments what i thought i would talk about today is the transition from one mode of thinking about nature to another that 's tracked by architecture what 's interesting about architects is we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature and arguably beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature so for roughly 300 years the hot debate in architecture was whether the number five or the number seven was a better proportion to think about architecture because the nose was one-fifth of your head or because your head was one-seventh of your body and the reason that that was the model of beauty and of nature was because the decimal point had not been invented yet -- it was n't the 16th century -- and everybody had to dimension a building in terms of fractions so a room would be dimensioned as one-fourth of a facade ; the structural dais of that might be dimensioned as 10 units and you would get down to the small elements by fractional subdivision : finer and finer and finer in the 15th century the decimal point was invented ; architects stopped using fractions and they had a new model of nature so what 's going on today is that there 's a model of natural form which is calculus-based and which is using digital tools and that has a lot of implications to the way we think about beauty and form and it has a lot of implications in the way we think about nature the best example of this would probably be the gothic and the gothic was invented after the invention of calculus although the gothic architects were n't really using calculus to define their forms but what was important is the gothic moment in architecture was the first time that force and motion was thought of in terms of form so examples like christopher wren 's king 's cross : you can see that the structural forces of the vaulting get articulated as lines so you 're really actually seeing the expression of structural force and form much later robert maillart 's bridges which optimize structural form with a calculus curvature almost like a parabola the hanging chain models of antonio gaudi the catalan architect the end of the 19th century beginning of the 20th century and how that hanging chain model translates into archways and vaulting so in all of these examples structure is the determining force frei otto was starting to use foam bubble diagrams and foam bubble models to generate his mannheim concert hall interestingly in the last 10 years norman foster used a similar heat thermal transfer model to generate the roof of the national gallery with the structural engineer chris williams in all these examples there 's one ideal form because these are thought in terms of structure and as an architect i 've always found these kinds of systems very limiting because i 'm not interested in ideal forms and i 'm not interested in optimizing to some perfect moment so what i thought i would bring up is another component that needs to be thought of whenever you think about nature and that 's basically the invention of generic form in genetic evolution my hero is actually not darwin ; it 's a guy named william bateson father of greg bateson who was here for a long time in monterey and he was what you 'd call a teratologist : he looked at all of the monstrosities and mutations to find rules and laws rather than looking at the norms so instead of trying to find the ideal type or the ideal average he 'd always look for the exception so in this example which is an example of what 's called bateson 's rule he has two kinds of mutations of a human thumb when i first saw this image 10 years ago i actually found it very strange and beautiful at the same time beautiful because it has symmetry so what he found is that in all cases of thumb mutations instead of having a thumb you would either get another opposable thumb or you would get four fingers so the mutations reverted to symmetry and bateson invented the concept of symmetry breaking which is that wherever you lose information in a system you revert back to symmetry so symmetry was n't the sign of order and organization -- which is what i was always understanding and as is an architect -- symmetry was the absence of information so whenever you lost information you 'd move to symmetry ; whenever you added information to a system you would break symmetry so this whole idea of natural form shifted at that moment from looking for ideal shapes to looking for a combination of information and generic form you know literally after seeing that image and finding out what bateson was working with we started to use these rules for symmetry breaking and branching to start to think about architectural form to just talk for a minute about the digital mediums that we 're using now and how they integrate calculus : the fact that they 're calculus-based means that we do n't have to think about dimension in terms of ideal units or discreet elements so in architecture we deal with big assemblies of components so there might be up to say 50,000 pieces of material in this room you 're sitting in right now that all need to get organized now typically you 'd think that they would all be the same : like the chairs you 're sitting in would all be the same dimension you know i have n't verified this but it 's the norm that every chair would be a slightly different dimension because you 'd want to space them all out for everybody 's sight lines the elements that make up the ceiling grid and the lighting they 're all losing their modular quality and moving more and more to these infinitesimal dimensions that 's because we 're all using calculus tools for manufacturing and for design calculus is also a mathematics of curves so even a straight line defined with calculus is a curve it 's just a curve without inflection so a new vocabulary of form is now pervading all design fields : whether it 's automobiles architecture products etc. it 's really being affected by this digital medium of curvature the intricacies of scale that come out of that -- you know in the example of the nose to the face there 's a fractional part-to-whole idea with calculus the whole idea of subdivision is more complex because the whole and the parts are one continuous series it 's too early in the morning for a lecture on calculus so i brought some images to just describe how that works this is a korean church that we did in queens and in this example you can see that the components of this stair are repetitive but they 're repetitive without being modular each one of the elements in this structure is a unique distance and dimension and all of the connections are unique angles now the only way we could design that or possibly construct it is by using a calculus-based definition of the form it also is much more dynamic so that you can see that the same form opens and closes in a very dynamic way as you move across it because it has this quality of vector in motion built into it so the same space that appears to be a kind of closed volume when seen from the other side becomes a kind of open vista and you also get a sense of visual movement in the space because every one of the elements is changing in a pattern so that pattern leads your eye towards the altar i think that 's one of the main changes also in architecture : that we 're starting to look now not for some ideal form like a latin cross for a church but actually all the traits of a church : so light that comes from behind from an invisible source directionality that focuses you towards an altar it turns out it 's not rocket science to design a sacred space you just need to incorporate a certain number of traits in a very kind of genetic way so these are the different perspectives of that interior which has a very complex set of orientations all in a simple form in terms of construction and manufacturing this is a kilometer-long housing block that was built in the '70s in amsterdam and here we 've broken the 500 apartments up into small neighborhoods and differentiated those neighborhoods i wo n't go into too much description of any of these projects but what you can see is that the escalators and elevators that circulate people along the face of the building are all held up by 122 structural trusses because we 're using escalators to move people all of these trusses are picking up diagonal loads so every one of them is a little bit different-shaped as you move down the length of the building so working with bentley and microstation we 've written a custom piece of software that networks all of the components together into these chunks of information so that if we change any element along the length of the building not only does that change distribute through each one of the trusses but each one of the trusses then distributes that information down the length of the entire facade of the building so it 's a single calculation for every single component of the building that we 're adding onto so it 's tens of millions of calculations just to design one connection between a piece of structural steel and another piece of structural steel but what it gives us is a harmonic and synthesized relationship of all these components one to another this idea has kind of brought me into doing some product design and it 's because design firms that have connections to architects like i 'm working with vitra which is a furniture company and alessi which is a houseware company they saw this actually solving a problem : this ability to differentiate components but keep them synthetic so not to pick on bmw or to celebrate them but take bmw as an example they have to in 2005 have a distinct identity for all their models of cars so the 300 series or whatever their newest car is the 100 series that 's coming out has to look like the 700 series at the other end of their product line so they need a distinct coherent identity which is bmw at the same time there 's a person paying 30,000 dollars for a 300-series car and a person paying 70,000 dollars for a 700 series and that person paying more than double does n't want their car to look too much like the bottom-of-the-market car so they have to also discriminate between these products so as manufacturing starts to allow more design options this problem gets exacerbated of the whole and the parts now as an architect part-to-whole relationships is all i think about but in terms of product design it 's becoming more and more of an issue for companies so the first kind of test product we did was with alessi which was for a coffee and tea set it 's an incredibly expensive coffee and tea set ; we knew that at the beginning so i actually went to some people i knew down south in san diego and we used an exploded titanium forming method that 's used in the aerospace industry basically what we can do is just cut a graphite mold put it in an oven heat it to 1,000 degrees gently inflate titanium that 's soft and then explode it at the last minute into this form but what 's great about it is the forms are only a few hundred dollars the titanium 's several thousand dollars but the forms are very cheap so we designed a system here of eight curves that could be swapped very similar to that housing project i showed you and we could recombine those together so that we always had ergonomic shapes that always had the same volume and could always be produced in the same way that way each one of these tools we could pay for with a few hundred dollars and get incredible variation in the components and this is one of those examples of the sets so for me what was important is that this coffee set -- which is just a coffee pot a teapot and those are the pots sitting on a tray -- that they would have a coherence -- so they would be greg lynn alessi coffee pots -- but that everyone who bought one would have a one-of-a-kind object that was unique in some way to go back to architecture what 's organic about architecture as a field unlike product design is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm like we have to design things which are coherent as a single object but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale architects tend to work with signature so that an architect needs a signature and that signature has to work across the scale of houses up to say skyscrapers and that problem of signatures is a thing we 're very good at maintaining and working with ; and intricacy which is the relationship of say the shape of a building its structure its windows its color its pattern these are real architectural problems so my kind of hero for this in the natural world are these tropical frogs i got interested in them because they 're the most extreme example of a surface where the texture and the -- let 's call it the decoration -- i know the frog does n't think of it as decoration but that 's how it works -- are all intricately connected to one another so a change in the form indicates a change in the color pattern so the pattern and the form are n't the same thing but they really work together and are fused in some way so when doing a center for the national parks in costa rica we tried to use that idea of a gradient color and a change in texture as the structure moves across the surface of the building we also used a continuity of change from a main exhibition hall to a natural history museum so it 's all one continuous change in the massing but within that massing are very different kinds of spaces and forms in a housing project in valencia spain we 're doing the different towers of housing fused together in shared curves so you get a single mass like a kind of monolith but it breaks down into individual elements and you can see that that change in massing also gives all 48 of the apartments a unique shape and size but always within a kind of controlled limit an envelope of change i work with a group of other architects we have a company called united architects we were one of the finalists for the world trade center site design and i think this just shows how we were approaching the problem of incredibly large-scale construction we wanted to make a kind of gothic cathedral around the footprints of the world trade center site and to do that we tried to connect up the five towers into a single system and we looked at from the 1950s on there were numerous examples of other architects trying to do the same thing we really approached it at the level of the typology of the building where we could build these five separate towers but they would all join at the 60th floor and make a kind of single monolithic mass with united architects also we made a proposal for the european central bank headquarters that used the same system but this time in a much more monolithic mass like a sphere but again you can see this kind of organic fusion of multiple building elements to make a thing which is whole but breaks down into smaller parts but in an incredibly organic way finally i 'd like to just show you some of the effects of using digital fabrication about six years ago i bought one of these cnc mills to just replace kind of young people cutting their fingers off all the time building models and i also bought a laser cutter and started to fabricate within my own shop kind of large-scale building elements and models where we could go directly to the tooling what i found out is that the tooling if you intervened in the software actually produced decorative effects so for these interiors like this shop in stockholm sweden or this installation wall in the netherlands at the netherlands architecture institute we could use the texture that the tool would leave to produce a lot of the spatial effects and we could integrate the texture of the wall with the form of the wall with the material so in vacuum-formed plastic in fiberglass and then even at the level of structural steel which you think of as being linear and modular the steel industry is so far ahead of the design industry that if you take advantage of it you can even start to think of beams and columns all rolled together into a single system which is highly efficient but also produces decorative effects and formal effects that are very beautiful and organic thanks very much you know one of the things that i 'd like to say upfront is that i 'm really here by accident and what i mean -- not at ted -- that i 'm -- at this point in my life truly my set of circumstances i would truly consider an accident but what i 'd like to talk to you about today is perhaps a way in which we could use technology to make those accidents happen often because i really think when i look back at how i actually ended up in this accident technology played a big role in that so what i 'd like to do today is tell you a little bit about myself because i 'd like to put in context what i 'm going to tell you and i think you will see why the two greatest passions in my life today are children and education and once i put that in context i 'd like to tell you a little bit about technology : why i believe technology is a tremendous enabler ; a very powerful tool to help address some of these challenges then about the initiative that chris mentioned that we decided to launch at amd that we call 50x15 and then i 'll come back to the beginning and tell you a little bit more -- hopefully convince you -- that i believe that in today 's world it is really important for business leaders not only to have an idea of what their business is all about but to have a passion for something that is meaningful so with that in mind first of all let me tell you i 'm one of five children i 'm the oldest the other four are women so i grew up in a family of women i learned a lot about how to deal with that part of the world and as you can imagine if you can picture this : i was born in a very small village in mexico in unfortunately very poor surroundings and my parents did not have a college education but i was fortunate to be able to have one and so were my four sisters that kind of tells you a little bit of an idea of the emphasis that my parents placed on education my parents were fanatics about learning and i 'll come back to that a little bit later but one of the things that exposed me early to learning and a tremendous curiosity that was instilled in me as a child was through a technology which is on the screen -- is a victrola my father found that in a junkyard and was able to repair it and make it work and somehow -- to this day i frankly do n't know how he was so aware of what was going on in the world -- but by inviting me to sit down with him when i was only a few years old and playing records in this victrola by mozart and he would tell me how mozart was the most romantic of all the classic composers ever and how claire de lune which was one of his favorites was a real exposure to me to classical music he explained to me about johann strauss and how he created the waltzes that became so famous in the world and would tell me a little bit about history too when he 'd play the 1812 overture by tchaikovsky on this little victrola and he would tell me about russia and all the things that were happening in russia at those times and why this music in some way represented a little bit of that history and even as a child he was able to instill in me a lot of curiosity and perhaps to you this product may not look like high tech but if you can imagine the time when this occurred -- it was in the mid '40s -- this was really in his view a pretty piece of high tech well one of the things that is really critical to try to distill from that experience is that in addition to that people ask me and say " well how did your parents treat you when you were a child " and i always said that they were really tough on me and not tough in the sense that most people think of where your parents yell at you or hit you or whatever they were tough in the sense that as i grew up both my mother and father would always say to me it 's really important that you always remember two things first of all when you go to bed at night you 've got to look back on the day and make sure that you felt the day was a day which you contributed something and that you did everything you could to do it the best way you could and the second thing they said : and we trust you that no matter where you are or where you go you will always do the right thing now i do n't know how many of you have ever done that with your kids but if you do please trust me it 's the most pressure you can put on a child to say -- -- we trust you that you will always do the right thing when i was out with my friends drinking beer i always was very aware of those words -- -- and very careful one of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful of course but it can only be helpful too if it 's accessible and in today 's world being useful affordable and accessible is not necessarily what happens in a lot of the technology that is done today so one of our passions in our company and now one of my personal passions is to be able to really work hard at making the technology useful accessible and affordable and to me that is very very critical now technology has changed a lot since the victrola days you know we now have of course incredibly powerful computers a tremendous thing that people refer to as a killer app is called the internet although frankly speaking we do n't believe the internet is the killer app what we believe is that the internet frankly is a connection of people and ideas the internet happens to be just the medium in which those people and ideas get connected and the power of connecting people and ideas can be pretty awesome and so we believe that through all the changes that have occurred that we 're faced today with a tremendous opportunity if we can connect people and ideas more intensely -- and although you 've seen a plethora and a myriad of products that have come to the market today the key to me is how many of these products are able to provide people connectivity in a useful way accessibility in an easy manner and also affordability that regardless of the economic status that a person could have that they could have the opportunity to afford this technology so when you look at that we said well we would like to then enable that a little bit we would like to create an initiative and a couple of years ago at amd we came up with this idea of saying what if we create this initiative we call 50x15 where we are going to aim that by the year 2015 half of the world will be connected to the internet so that people and ideas can get connected we knew we could n't do it by ourselves and by no means did we ever intend to imply that we at amd could do it alone we always felt that this was something that could be done through partnerships with governments industry educational institutions a myriad of other companies and frankly even competitors so it is really a rather lofty initiative if you want to think that way but we felt that we had to put a real stake up in the years ahead that was bold enough and courageous enough that it would force us all to think of ways to do things differently and i 'll come back to that in a minute because i think the results so far have been remarkable and i can only anticipate and get real excited about what i think is going to happen in the next eight years while we get to the 2015 initiative where are we today that 's year by year this comes from our friends at gapminder.com those of you who 've never looked at their website you should look at it it 's really impressive and you can see how the internet penetration has changed over the years and so when we gave ourselves this scorecard to say well where are we related to our goal towards 2015 the thing that becomes apparent is three pieces one is the western world defined mostly by western europe and the united states has made an awful lot of progress the connectivity in these parts of the world are really truly phenomenal and continue to increase as a matter of fact we think reaching 100 percent is very doable even before the 2015 timeframe in other parts of emerging countries such as india and china the progress has been good -- has been solid has been good but in places that are not as developed places like africa latin america and other places in the world the progress has been rather slow as a matter of fact i was just recently visiting south africa i had the opportunity to have a discussion with president mbeki and one of the things that we talked about is what is it that 's keeping this connectivity goal from moving ahead faster and one of the reasons is in south africa it costs 100 dollars a month to have a broadband connectivity it is impossible even in the united states for that cost to be able to enable the connectivity that we 're all trying to reach so we talked about ways in which perhaps one could partner to be able to bring the cost of this technology down so when you look at this chart you look at the very last -- it 's a logarithmic chart on a horizontal scale -- you look at the very end : we 've got quite a long way to go to get to the 2015 goal of 50 percent but we 're excited in our company ; we 're motivated we really think it 's a phenomenal driver of things to force us to do things differently and we look forward to being able to actually working with so many partners around the world to be able to reach that goal now one of the things i 'd like to explain [ about ] 50x15 which i think is really critical is that it is not a charity it is actually a business venture let 's take a small segment of this of this unconnected world and call it the education market when you look at elementary-school children we have hundreds and hundreds of millions of children around the world that could benefit tremendously from being able to be connected to the internet therefore when we see that we see an opportunity to have a business that addresses the need of that segment and when we embarked in this initiative from the very beginning we said it very clearly : this is not a charity this is really a business venture one that addresses a very challenging segment of the market because what we have learned in the last three years is that this segment of the market whether it 's education or under-developed nations either way it 's a segment that demands incredibly high quality incredibly high reliability tremendous low cost and access and a lot of challenges that frankly without actually doing it it would be very difficult to understand and i 'll explain that in just a minute it is an initiative that is focused on simple accessible and human-centric solutions what we mean by that is you know frankly the pc was invented in 1980 roughly speaking more or less and for 20-odd years it has n't changed it is still in most places a gray or black box and it looks the same and frankly -- and i know that sometimes i offend some of my customers when i say this but i truly mean it -- if you could take the name of the computer off the top of it it would be very difficult to judge who made it because they 're all highly commoditized but they 're all different so there has not been a human-centric approach to addressing this segment of the market so we really believe it is critical to think of it it reminded me a lot of the talk we heard this morning about this operating room machinery that was designed specifically for africa we 're talking about something very similar here and it has to be based on a geo-sensitive approach what i mean by that is that in some parts of the world the government plays a key role in the development of technology in other parts it does n't in other parts of the world you have an infrastructure that allows for manufacturing to take place in other parts it does n't and then we have to be sensitive about how this technology can be developed and put into action in those regions and the last piece which is really important -- and this is an opinion that we have not shared by many this is one where we seem to stand alone on this one -- is that we really believe that the greatest success of this initiative can come by fostering local integrated end-to-end ecosystems what i mean by that and let me use this example the country of south africa because i was just there therefore i 'm a little bit familiar with some of the challenges they have it 's a country of 45 million people it 's an economy that 's emerging it 's beginning to grow tremendously they have an objective to lowering the cost of connectivity they have a computer company that makes computers in south africa they 're developing a software-training environment in their universities what a place what an ideal place to create an ecosystem that could build the hardware and the software needed for their schools and to my surprise i learned in south africa they have 18 dialects i always thought they only had two -- english and afrikaans -- but it turns out they have 18 dialects and to be able to meet the needs of this rather complex educational system it could only be done from inside i do n't think this segment of the market can be addressed by companies parachuting from another place of the world and just dumping product and selling into the markets so we believe that in those regions of the world where the population is large and there 's an infrastructure that can provide it that a local integrated end-to-end system is really critical for its success this is a picture of a classroom that we outfitted with computers in mexico in my home country this particular classroom happens to be in the state of michoacan those of you that might be familiar with mexico -- michoacan is a very colorful state children dress with very colorful colorful clothes and it is incredible to see the power that this has in the hands of kids in a computer and i have to tell you that it 's so easy to appreciate the impact that access to technology and connectivity can have in the lives and education of these kids we just recently opened a learning laboratory in a school in the west cape in south africa in a school that 's called nelson mandela school and when you see the faces and activities of these children being able to access computers it 's just phenomenal and recently they 've written us letters telling us how excited they are about the impact that this has had on their lives on their educational dreams on their capabilities and it 's just phenomenal we have now deployed 30 different technologists in 18 different countries and we have been able to connect millions of people in an effort to continue to learn what this particular segment of the market needs and demands and i have to tell you that although millions does n't sound like a lot in terms of the billions that need to be connected it 's a start and we are learning a lot and we 're learning a tremendous amount about what we believe this segment needs to be able to be effective one example of this has been the one laptop per child some of you are familiar with this this is a partnership between mit and a group of companies -- google is involved red hat -- and amd is a key player the electronics behind the one laptop per child are based on amd technology ; it 's a microprocessor but to give you an idea how creative this group of people can be one of the objectives of the one laptop per child is to be able to achieve a 10-hour battery life because it was felt that a school day would last at least eight hours and you wanted the child to have the ability to use the laptop for at least one full day without having to recharge it the engineers have done a phenomenal amount of innovation on this part and battery life on this product is now 15 hours -- just through a lot of innovative work people have done because they 're passionate and motivated to be able to do this we expect this to be deployed towards the end of this year and we 're very excited at the opportunities that this is going to offer in the field of education it 's a highly focused product aimed at strictly the education market not only in the developing countries but actually in the developed regions as well because there are parts of the united states where this can have also a huge impact on the ability to make education more fun and more efficient we also have partnered with ted in this project with architecture for humanity and along with the ted prize winner cameron sinclair we 're having a contest that we have issued to the architectural community to come up with the best design for a computer lab for an emerging region and we 're really thrilled about the opportunity to be part of this and ca n't wait to see what comes out of this exciting exciting activity let me come back to the beginning to end this presentation i 'll tell you that one of the things that i feel is really critical for us in industry in business is to be able to be passionate about solving these problems i do n't think it 's enough to be able to put them on a spreadsheet and look at numbers and say yes that 's a good business i really believe that you have to have a passion for it and one of the things that i learned too from my parents -- and i 'll give you a little anecdote -- especially from my father and it took me a while to understand it but he said to me when i went to college he said " you 're the first person in the family to go to college and it 's really important you understand that for civilization to make progress each generation has to do better than the last one and therefore this is your opportunity to do better than my generation " frankly i do n't know that i really understood what he told me at the time i was eager to go off to college and go find girls and study and girls and study but then i finished college and i fell in love i graduated i decided to get married and on my wedding day my father came to me again and said " you know i 'm going to remind you again that each generation has to do better than the last one you have to be a better husband than i was because that 's how you make progress " and now he began to make sense because i knew what a great husband he was and now he was once again beginning to put pressure on me like he did when i was a little kid and then a few years later i had a child my first child and again my father comes to the hospital and we 're looking at the glass and see all the children on the other side and he said " i 've got to remind you again that for each generation to do better you 're going to have to be a better father than i was " that 's when it dawned on me the tremendous challenge that he was placing on me because he was a great father but the key is that he instilled in me a passion to really get up every day in the morning and want to do better to really get up and think that my role in life is not just to be the ceo of a fortune 500 company it 's got to be that someday i can look back and this place is truly better through some small contribution that perhaps each of us could make thank you very much many of you could ask the question you know why is a flying car or maybe more accurately a roadable aircraft possible at this time a number of years ago mr. ford predicted that flying cars of some form would be available now 60 years later i 'm here to tell you why it 's possible when i was about five years old not very much -- about a year after mr. ford made his predictions i was living in a rural part of canada on the side of a mountain in a very isolated area getting to school for a kid that was actually pretty short for his age through the canadian winter was not a pleasant experience it was a trying and scary thing for a young kid to be going through at the end of my first year in school in the summer of that year i discovered a couple hummingbirds that were caught in a shed near my home they 'd worn themselves out beating themselves against the window and well they were easy to capture i took them outside and as i let them go that split second even though they were very tired that second i let them go they hovered for a second then zipped off into the distance i thought what a great way to get to school for a kid at that age this was like infinite speed disappearing and i was very inspired by that and so the next -- over the next six decades believe it or not i 've built a number of aircraft with the goal of creating something that could do for you or me what the hummingbird does and give you that flexibility i 've called this vehicle generically a volantor after the latin word " volant " meaning to fly in a light nimble manner volantor-like helicopter perhaps the faa the controlling body above all calls it a " powered lift aircraft " and they 've actually issued a pilot 's license -- a powerlift pilot 's license -- for this type of aircraft it 's closer than you think it 's kind of remarkable when you consider that there are no operational powered lift aircraft so for once perhaps the government is ahead of itself the press calls my particular volantor a " skycar " this is a little bit earlier version of it that 's why it 's given the x designation but it 's a four-passenger aircraft that could take off vertically like a helicopter -- therefore it does n't need an airfield on the ground it 's powered electrically it 's actually classified as a motorcycle because of the three wheels which is a great asset because it allows you theoretically to use this on the highways in most states and actually in all cities so that 's an asset because if you 've got to deal with the crash protection issues of the automobile forget it -- you 're never going to fly it one could say that a helicopter does pretty much what the hummingbird does and gets around in much the same way and it 's true but a helicopter is a very complex device it 's expensive -- so expensive that very few people could own or use it it 's often been described because of its fragile nature and its complexity as a series of parts -- a large number of parts -- flying in formation another difference and i have to describe this because it 's very personal another great difference between the helicopter and the volantor -- in my case the skycar volantor -- is the experience that i 've had in flying both of those in a helicopter you feel -- and it 's still a remarkable sensation -- you feel like you 're being hauled up from above by a vibrating crane when you get in the skycar -- and i can tell you there 's only one other person that 's flown it but he had the same sensation -- you really feel like you 're being lifted up by a magic carpet without any vibration whatsoever the sensation is unbelievable and it 's been a great motivator i only get to fly this vehicle occasionally and only when i can persuade my stockholders to let me do so but it 's still one of those wonderful experiences that reward you for all that time what we really need is something to replace the automobile for those 50-plus mile trips very few people realize that 50 mile-plus trips make up 85 percent of the miles traveled in america if we can get rid of that then the highways will now be useful to you as contrasted by what 's happening in many parts of the world today on this next slide is an interesting history of what we really have seen in infrastructure because whether i give you a perfect skycar the perfect vehicle for use it 's going to have very little value to you unless you 've got a system to use it in i 'm sure any of you have asked the question yeah are there great things up there -- what am i going to do get up there it 's bad enough on a highway what 's it going to be like to be in the air this world that you 're going to be talking about tomorrow is going to be completely integrated you 're not going to be a pilot you 're going to be a passenger and it 's the infrastructure that really determines whether this process goes forward i can tell you technically we can build skycars -- my god we went to the moon ! the technology there was much more difficult than what i 'm dealing with here but we have to have these priority changes we have to have infrastructure to go with this historically you see that we got around 200 years ago by canals and as that system disappeared were replaced by railroads as that disappeared we came in with highways but if you look at that top corner -- the highway system -- you see where we are today highways are no longer being built and that 's a fact you wo n't see any additional highways in the next 10 years however the next 10 years if like the last 10 years we 're going to see 30 percent more traffic and where is that going to lead you to so the issue then i 've often asked is when is it going to happen when are we going to be able to have these vehicles and of course if you ask me i 'm going to give you a really optimistic view after all i 've been spending 60 years here believing it 's going to happen tomorrow so i 'm not going to quote myself on this i 'd prefer to quote someone else who testified with me before congress and in his position as head of nasa put forward this particular vision of the future of this type of aircraft now i would argue actually if you look at the fact that on the highways today you 're only averaging about 30 miles per hour -- on average according to the dot -- the skycar travels at over 300 miles an hour up to 25,000 feet and so in effect you could see perhaps a tenfold increase in the ability to get around as far as speed is concerned unbeknownst to many of you the highway in the sky that i 'm talking about here has been under construction for 10 years it makes use of the gps -- you 're familiar with gps in your automobile but you may not be familiar with the fact that there 's a gps u.s. there 's a russian gps and there 's a new gps system going to europe called galileo with those three systems you have what is always necessary -- a level of redundancy that says if one system fails you 'll still have a way to make sure that you 're being controlled because if you 're in this world where computers are controlling what you 're doing it 's going to be very critical that something ca n't fail on you how would a trip in a skycar work well you ca n't right now take off from your home because it 's too noisy i mean to be able to take off from your home you 'd have to be extremely quiet but it 's still fairly quiet you 'd motor electrically to a vertiport which may be a few blocks maybe even a few miles away this is clearly as i said earlier a roadable aircraft and you 're not going to spend that much time on the road after all if you can fly like that why are you going to drive around on a highway go to a local vertiport plug in your destination delivered almost like a passenger you can play computer games you can sleep you can read on the way this is the world -- there wo n't be you as a pilot and i know the pilots in the audience are n't going to like that -- and i 've had a lot of bad feedback from people who want to be up there flying around and experiencing that and of course i suppose like recreational parks you can still do that but the vehicle itself is going to be a very very controlled environment or it 's going to have no use to you as a person who might use such a system we flew the first vehicle for the international press in 1965 when i really got it started i was a professor at the u.c davis system and i got a lot of excitement around this and i was able to fund the initiation of the program back in that time and then through the various years we invented various vehicles actually the critical point was in 1989 when we demonstrated the stability of this vehicle -- how completely stable it was in all circumstances which is of course very critical still not a practical vehicle during all of this but moving in the right direction we believe finally in the early part of -- or actually the middle of 2002 we flew the 400 -- m400 which was the four-passenger vehicle in this case here we 're flying it remotely as we always did at the beginning and we had very small power plants in it at this time we are now installing larger powerplants which will make it possible for me to get back on board a vertical-takeoff aircraft is not the safest vehicle during the test flight program there 's an old adage that applied for the years between 1950s and 1970s when every aeronautical company was working on vertical-takeoff aircraft a vertical-takeoff aircraft needs an artificial stabilization system -- that 's essential at least for the hover and the low-speed flight if that single-stability system that brain that flies that aircraft fails or if the engine fails that vehicle crashes there is no option to that and the adage that i 'm referring to that applied at that time was that nothing comes down faster than a vtol aircraft upside down that 's a macabre comment because we lost a lot of pilots in fact the aircraft companies gave up on vertical-takeoff aircraft more or less for a number of years and there 's really only one operational aircraft in the world today that 's a vertical-takeoff aircraft -- as distinct from a helicopter -- and that 's the hawker harrier jump jet a vertical-takeoff aircraft like the hummingbird has a very high metabolism which means it requires a lot of energy getting that energy is very very difficult it all comes down to that power plant -- how to get a large amount of power in a small package fortunately dr. felix wankel invented the rotary engine a very unique engine -- it 's round it 's small it 's vibration-free it fits exactly where we need to fit it right in the center of the hubs of the ducts in the system -- very critical in fact that engine -- for those who are into the automobile -- know that it recently is applied to the rx8 -- the mazda and that sportscar won sports car of the year wonderful engine in that application it generates one horsepower per pound which is twice as good as your car engine today but only half of what we need my company has spent 35 years and many millions of dollars taking that rotary engine which was invented in the late '50s and getting it to the point that we get over two horsepower per pound reliably and critical we actually get 175 horsepower into one cubic foot we have eight engines in this vehicle we have four computers we have two parachutes redundancy is the critical issue here if you want to stay alive you 've got to have backups and we have actually flown this vehicle and lost an engine and continued to hover the computers back up each other there 's a voting system -- if one computer is not agreeing with the other three it 's kicked out of the system and then you have three -- you still have the triple redundancy if one of those fails you still have a second chance if you stick around then good luck there wo n't be a third chance the parachutes are there -- hopefully more for psychological than real reasons but they will be an ultimate backup if it comes to that i 'd like to show you an animation in this next one which is one element of the skycar 's use but it 's one that demonstrates how it could be used you could think of it personally in your own terms of how you might use it video : skycar dispatched launch rescue vehicle for san francisco paul moller : i believe that personal transportation in something like the skycar probably in another volantor form as well will be a significant part of our lives as dr. goldin says within the next 10 years and it 's going to change the demographics in a very significant way if you can live 75 miles from san francisco and get there in 15 minutes you 're going to sell your 700,000-dollar apartment buy an upscale home on the side of a mountain buy a skycar which i think would be priced at that time perhaps in the area of 100,000 dollars put money in the bank â€¦ that 's a very significant incentive for getting out of san francisco but you better be the first one out of town as the real estate values go to hell developing the skycar has been a real challenge obviously i 'm dependent on a lot of other people believing in what i 'm doing -- both financially and in technical help and that has -- you run into situations where you have this great acceptance of what you 're doing and a lot of rejection of the same kind of thing i characterized this emerging technology in an aphorism as it 's described which really talks about what i 've experienced and i 'm sure what other people may have experienced in emerging technologies there 's an interesting poll that came out recently under nas -- i think it 's msnbc -- in which they asked the question " are you in the market for a volantor " twenty-three percent said " yes as soon as possible " forty-seven percent -- yes as soon as they could -- price could come down twenty-three percent said " as soon as it 's proven safe " only seven percent said that they would n't consider buying a skycar i 'm encouraged by that at least it makes me feel like to some extent it is becoming self-evident that we need an alternative to the automobile at least for those 50-mile trips and more so that the highways become usable in today 's world thank you this is a wheat bread a whole wheat bread and it 's made with a new technique that i 've been playing around with and developing and writing about which for lack of a better name we call the epoxy method and i call it an epoxy method because -- it 's not very appetizing i understand that -- but -- but if you think about epoxy what 's epoxy it 's two resins that are sort of in and of themselves -- neither of which can make glue but when you put the two together something happens a bond takes place and you get this very strong powerful adhesive well in this technique what i 've tried to do is kind of gather all of the knowledge that the bread-baking world the artisan bread-baking community has been trying to accumulate over the last 20 years or so -- since we 've been engaged in a bread renaissance in america -- and put it together to come up with a method that would help to take whole-grain breads and let 's face it everyone 's trying to move towards whole grains we finally after 40 years of knowing that wholegrain was a healthier option we 're finally getting to the point where we actually are tipping over and attempting to actually eat them the challenge though for a wholegrain baker is you know how do you make it taste good because whole grain -- it 's easy with white flour to make a good-tasting bread white flour is sweet it 's mainly starch and starch when you break it down -- what is starch it 's -- thank you -- sugar yes so a baker and a good baker knows how to pull or draw forth the inherent sugar trapped in the starch with whole grain bread you have other obstacles you 've got bran which is probably the healthiest part of the bread for us or the fiber for us because it is just loaded with fiber for the bran is fiber it 's got germ those are the good things but those are n't the tastiest parts of the wheat so whole grain breads historically have had sort of this onus of being health food breads and people do n't like to eat quote health food they like to eat healthy and healthily but when we think of something as a health food we think of it as something we eat out of obligation not out of passion and love for the flavor and ultimately the challenge of the baker the challenge of every culinary student of every chef is to deliver flavor flavor is king flavor rules i call it the flavor rule flavor rules and -- and you can get somebody to eat something that 's good for them once but they wo n't eat it again if they do n't like it right so this is the challenge for this bread we 're going to try this at lunch and i 'll explain a bit more about it but it 's made not only with two types of pre-doughs -- this attempt again at bringing out flavor is to make a piece of dough the day before that is not leavened it 's just dough that is wet it 's hydrated dough we call " the soaker " -- that helps to start enzyme activity and enzymes are the secret kind of ingredient in dough that brings out flavor it starts to release the sugars trapped in the starch that 's what enzymes are doing and so if we can release some of those they become accessible to us in our palate they become accessible to the yeast as food they become accessible to the oven for caramelization to give us a beautiful crust the other pre-dough that we make is fermented -- our pre-ferment and it 's made -- it can be a sourdough starter or what we call a " biga " or any other kind of pre-fermented dough with a little yeast in it and that starts to develop flavor also and on day two we put those two pieces together that 's the epoxy and we 're hoping that sort of the enzyme piece of dough becomes the fuel pack for the leavened piece of dough and when we put them together and add the final ingredients we can create a bread that does evoke the full potential of flavor trapped in the grain that 's the challenge okay so now what we -- in the journey of wheat let 's go back and look at these 12 stages i 'm going to go through them very quickly and then revisit them okay we 're going to start with the first stage and this is what every student has to begin with everyone who works in the culinary world knows that the first stage of cooking is " mise en place " which is just a french way of saying " get organized " everything in its place first stage so in baking we call it scaling -- weighing out the ingredients stage two is mixing we take the ingredients and we mix them we have to develop the gluten there 's no gluten in flour there 's only the potential for gluten here 's another kind of prefiguring of epoxy because we 've got glutenin and gliadin neither of which are strong enough to make a good bread but when they get hydrated and they bond to each other they create a stronger molecule a stronger protein we call gluten and so we in the mixing process have to develop the gluten we have to activate the leaven or the yeast and we have to essentially distribute all the ingredients evenly then we get into fermentation the third stage which is really where the flavor develops the yeast comes alive and starts eating the sugars creating carbon dioxide and alcohol -- essentially it 's burping and sweating which is what bread is it 's yeast burps and sweat and somehow this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food and we 're going to explore that in a minute but then quickly through the next few stages we after it 's fermented and it 's developed started to develop flavor and character we divide it into smaller units and then we take those units and we shape them we give them a little pre-shape usually a round or a little torpedo shape sometimes that 's called " rounding " and there 's a short rest period it can be for a few seconds it can be for 20 or 30 minutes we call that resting or benching then we go into final shaping " panning " -- which means putting the shaped loaf on a pan this takes a second but it 's a distinctive stage it can be in a basket it can be in a loaf pan but we pan it and then stage nine the fermentation which started at stage three is continuing through all these other stages again developing more flavor the final fermentation takes place in stage nine we call it " proofing " proofing means to prove that the dough is alive and at stage nine we get the dough to the final shape and it goes into the oven -- stage 10 three transformations take place in the oven the sugars in the dough caramelize in the crust they give us that beautiful brown crust only the crust can caramelize it 's the only place that gets hot enough inside the proteins -- this gluten -- coagulates when it gets to about 160 degrees the proteins all line up and they create structure the gluten structure -- what ultimately we will call the crumb of the bread and the starches when they reach about 180 degrees gelatinize and gelatinization is yet another oven transformation coagulation caramelization and gelatinization -- when the starch is thick and they absorb all the moisture that 's around them they -- they kind of swell and then they burst and they burst and they spill their guts into the bread so basically now we 're eating yeast sweats -- sweat burps and starch guts again transformed in stage 10 in the oven because what went into the oven as dough comes out in stage 11 as bread and stage 11 we call it cooling -- because we never really eat the bread right away there 's a little carry-over baking the proteins have to set up strengthen and firm up and then we have stage 12 which the textbooks call " packaging " but my students call " eating " and so we 're going to be on our own journey today from wheat to eat and in a few minutes we will try this and see if we have succeeded in fulfilling this baker 's mission of pulling out flavor but i want to go back now and revisit these steps and talk about it from the standpoint of transformation because i really believe that all things can be understood -- and this is not my own idea this goes back to the scholastics and to the ancients -- that all things can be understood on four levels : the literal the metaphoric or poetic level the political or ethical level and ultimately the mystical or sometimes called the " anagogical " level it 's hard to get to those levels unless you go through the literal in fact dante says you ca n't understand the three deeper levels unless you first understand the literal level so that 's why we 're talking literally about bread from the standpoint of connections to possibly a deeper level -- all in my quest for answering the question " what is it about bread that 's so special " and fulfilling this mission of evoking the full potential of flavor because what happens is bread begins as wheat or any other grain but what 's wheat wheat is a grass that grows in the field and like all grasses at a certain point it puts out seeds and we harvest those seeds and those are the wheat kernels now in order to harvest it -- i mean what 's harvesting it 's just a euphemism for killing right i mean that 's what 's harvest -- we say we harvest the pig you know yes we slaughter you know yes that 's life we harvest the wheat and in harvesting it we kill it now wheat is alive and as we harvest it it gives up its seeds now at least with seeds we have the potential for future life we can plant those in the ground and we save some of those for the next generation but most of those seeds get crushed and turned into flour and at that point the wheat has suffered the ultimate indignity it 's not only been killed but it 's been denied any potential for creating future life so we turn it into flour so as i said i think bread is a transformational food the first transformation -- and by the way the definition of transformation for me is a radical change from one thing into something else o.k. radical not subtle not like hot water made cold or cold water turned hot but water boiled off and becoming steam that 's a transformation two different things well in this case the first transformation is alive to dead i 'd call that radical so we 've got now this flour and what do we do we add some water in stage one we weigh it in stage two we add water and salt to it mix it together and we create something that we call " clay " it 's like clay and we infuse that clay with an ingredient that we call " leaven " in this case it 's yeast but yeast is leaven what does leaven mean leaven comes from the root word that means enliven -- to vivify to bring to life by the way what 's the hebrew word for clay adam you see the baker in this moment has become in a sense sort of the god of his dough you know and his dough well while it 's not an intelligent life form is now alive and we know it 's alive because in stage three it grows growth is the proof of life and while it 's growing all these literal transformations are taking place enzymes are breaking forth sugars yeast is eating sugar and turning it into carbon dioxide and alcohol bacteria is in there eating the same sugars turning them into acids in other words personality and character 's being developed in this dough under the watchful gaze of the baker and the baker 's choices all along the way determine the outcome of the product a subtle change in temperature -- a subtle change in time -- it 's all about a balancing act between time temperature and ingredients that 's the art of baking so all these things are determined by the baker and the bread goes through some stages and characters develop and then we divide it and this one big piece of dough is divided into smaller units and each of those units are given shape by the baker and as they 're shaped they 're raised again all along proving that they 're alive and developing character and at stage 10 we take it to the oven it 's still dough nobody eats bread dough -- a few people do i think but not too many i 've met some dough eaters but -- it 's not the staff of life right bread is the staff of life but dough is what we 're working with and we take that dough to the oven and it goes into the oven as soon as the interior temperature of that dough crosses the threshold of 140 degrees it passes what we call the " thermal death point " students love that tdp they think it 's the name of a video game but it 's the thermal death point -- all life ceases there the yeast whose mission it has been up till now to raise the dough to enliven it to vivify it in order to complete its mission which is also to turn this dough into bread has to give up its life so you see the symbolism at work it 's starting to come forth a little bit you know it 's starting to make sense to me -- what goes in is dough what comes out is bread -- or it goes in alive comes out dead third transformation first transformation alive to dead second transformation dead brought back to life third transformation alive to dead -- but dough to bread or another analogy would be a caterpillar has been turned into a butterfly and it 's what comes out of the oven that is what we call the staff of life this is the product that everyone in the world eats that is so difficult to give up it 's so deeply embedded in our psyches that bread is used as a symbol for life it 's used as a symbol for transformation and so as we get to stage 12 and we partake of that again completing the life cycle you know we have a chance to essentially ingest that -- it nurtures us and we continue to carry on and have opportunities to ponder things like this so this is what i 've learned from bread this is what bread has taught me in my journey and what we 're going to attempt to do with this bread here again is to use in addition to everything we talked about this bread we 're going to call " spent grain bread " because as you know bread-making is very similar to beer-making beer is basically liquid bread or bread is solid beer and -- they -- they 're invented around the same time i think beer came first and the egyptian who was tending the beer fell asleep in the hot egyptian sun and it turned into bread but we 've got this bread and what i did here is to try to again evoke even more flavor from this grain was we 've added into it the spent grain from beer-making and if you make this bread you can use any kind of spent grain from any type of beer i like dark spent grain today we 're using a light spent grain that 's actually from like some kind of a lager of some sort -- a light lager or an ale -- that is wheat and barley that 's been toasted in other words the beer-maker knows also how to evoke flavor from the grains by using sprouting and malting and roasting we 're going to take some of that and put it into the bread so now we not only have a high-fiber bread but now fiber on top of fiber and so this is again hopefully not only a healthy bread but a bread that you will enjoy so if i kind of break this bread maybe we can share this now a little bit here we 'll start a little piece here and i 'm going to take a little piece here -- i think i 'd better taste it myself before you have it at lunch i 'll leave you with what i call the baker 's blessing may your crust be crisp and your bread always rise thank you i 'm going to talk about a technology that we 're developing at oxford now that we think is going to change the way that computer games and hollywood movies are being made that technology is simulating humans it 's simulated humans with a simulated body and a simulated nervous system to control that body now before i talk more about that technology let 's have a quick look at what human characters look like at the moment in computer games this is a clip from a game called " grand theft auto 3 " we already saw that briefly yesterday and what you can see is -- it is actually a very good game it 's one of the most successful games of all time but what you 'll see is that all the animations in this game are very repetitive they pretty much look the same i 've made him run into a wall here over and over again and you can see he looks always the same the reason for that is that these characters are actually not real characters they are a graphical visualization of a character to produce these animations an animator at a studio has to anticipate what 's going to happen in the actual game and then has to animate that particular sequence so he or she sits down animates it and tries to anticipate what 's going to happen and then these particular animations are just played back at appropriate times in the computer game now the result of that is that you ca n't have real interactivity all you have is animations that are played back at more or less the appropriate times it also means that games are n't really going to be as surprising as they could be because you only get out of it at least in terms of the character what you actually put into it there 's no real emergence there and thirdly as i said most of the animations are very repetitive because of that now the only way to get around that is to actually simulate the human body and to simulate that bit of the nervous system of the brain that controls that body and maybe if i could have you for a quick demonstration to show what the difference is -- because i mean it 's very very trivial if i push chris a bit like this for example he 'll react to it if i push him from a different angle he 'll react to it differently and that 's because he has a physical body and because he has the motor skills to control that body it 's a very trivial thing it 's not something you get in computer games at the moment at all thank you very much chris anderson : that 's it torsten reil : that 's it yes so that 's what we 're trying to simulate -- not chris specifically i should say but humans in general now we started working on this a while ago at oxford university and we tried to start very simply what we tried to do was teach a stick figure how to walk that stick figure is physically stimulated you can see it here on the screen so it 's subject to gravity has joints etc if you just run the simulation it will just collapse like this the tricky bit is now to put an ai controller in it that actually makes it work and for that we use the neural network which we based on that part of the nervous system that we have in our spine that controls walking in humans it 's called the central pattern generator so we simulated that as well and then the really tricky bit is to teach that network how to walk for that we used artificial evolution -- genetic algorithms we heard about those already yesterday and i suppose that most of you are familiar with that already but just briefly the concept is that you create a large number of different individuals -- neural networks in this case -- all of which are random at the beginning you hook these up -- in this case to the virtual muscles of that two-legged creature here -- and hope that it does something interesting at the beginning they 're all going to be very boring most of them wo n't move at all but some of them might make a tiny step those are then selected by the algorithm reproduced with mutation and recombinations to introduce sex as well and you repeat that process over and over again until you have something that walks -- in this case in a straight line like this so that was the idea behind this when we started this i set up the simulation one evening it took about three to four hours to run the simulation i got up the next morning went to the computer and looked at the results and was hoping for something that walked in a straight line like i 've just demonstrated and this is what i got instead so it was back to the drawing board for us we did get it to work eventually after tweaking a bit here and there and this is an example of a successful evolutionary run so what you 'll see in a moment is a very simple biped that 's learning how to walk using artificial evolution at the beginning it ca n't walk at all but it will get better and better over time so this is the one that ca n't walk at all now after five generations of applying evolutionary process the genetic algorithm is getting a tiny bit better generation 10 and it 'll take a few steps more -- still not quite there but now after generation 20 it actually walks in a straight line without falling over that was the real breakthrough for us it was academically quite a challenging project and once we had reached that stage we were quite confident that we could try and do other things as well with this approach -- actually simulating the body and simulating that part of the nervous system that controls it now at this stage it also became clear that this could be very exciting for things like computer games or online worlds what you see here is the character standing there and there 's an obstacle that we put in its way and what you see is it 's going to fall over the obstacle now the interesting bit is if i move the obstacle a tiny bit to the right which is what i 'm doing now here it will fall over it in a completely different way and again if you move the obstacle a tiny bit it 'll again fall differently now what you see by the way at the top there are some of the neural activations being fed into the virtual muscles okay that 's the video thanks now this might look kind of trivial but it 's actually very important because this is not something you get at the moment in any interactive or any virtual worlds now at this stage we decided to start a company and move this further because obviously this was just a very simple blocky biped what we really wanted was a full human body so we started the company we hired a team of physicists software engineers and biologists to work on this and the first thing we had to work on was to create the human body basically it 's got to be relatively fast so you can run it on a normal machine but it 's got to be accurate enough so it looks good enough basically so we put quite a bit of biomechanical knowledge into this thing and tried to make it as realistic as possible what you see here on the screen right now is a very simple visualization of that body i should add that it 's very simple to add things like hair clothes etc. but what we 've done here is use a very simple visualization so you can concentrate on the movement now what i 'm going to do right now in a moment is just push this character a tiny bit and we 'll see what happens nothing really interesting basically it falls over but it falls over like a rag doll basically the reason for that is that there 's no intelligence in it it becomes interesting when you put artificial intelligence into it so this character now has motor skills in the upper body -- nothing in the legs yet in this particular one but what it will do -- i 'm going to push it again it will realize autonomously that it 's being pushed it 's going to stick out its hands it 's going to turn around into the fall and try and catch the fall so that 's what you see here now it gets really interesting if you then add the ai for the lower part of the body as well so here we 've got the same character i 'm going to push it a bit harder now harder than i just pushed chris but what you 'll see is -- it 's going to receive a push now from the left what you see is it takes steps backwards it tries to counter-balance it tries to look at the place where it thinks it 's going to land i 'll show you this again and then finally hits the floor now this becomes really exciting when you push that character in different directions again just as i 've done that 's something that you can not do right now at the moment you only have empty computer graphics in games what this is now is a real simulation that 's what i want to show you now so here 's the same character with the same behavior i 've just shown you but now i 'm just going to push it from different directions first starting with a push from the right this is all slow motion by the way so we can see what 's going on now the angle will have changed a tiny bit so you can see that the reaction is different again a push now this time from the front and you see it falls differently and now from the left -- and it falls differently that was really exciting for us to see that that was the first time we 've seen that this is the first time the public sees this as well because we have been in stealth mode i have n't shown this to anybody yet now just a fun thing : what happens if you put that character -- this is now a wooden version of it but it 's got the same ai in it -- but if you put that character on a slippery surface like ice we just did that for a laugh just to see what happens and this is what happens it 's nothing we had to do about this we just took this character that i just talked about put it on a slippery surface and this is what you get out of it and that 's a really fascinating thing about this approach now when we went to film studios and games developers and showed them that technology we got a very good response and what they said was the first thing they need immediately is virtual stuntmen because stunts are obviously very dangerous they 're very expensive and there are a lot of stunt scenes that you can not do obviously because you ca n't really allow the stuntman to be seriously hurt so they wanted to have a digital version of a stuntman and that 's what we 've been working on for the past few months and that 's our first product that we 're going to release in a couple of weeks so here are just a few very simple scenes of the guy just being kicked that 's what people want that 's what we 're giving them you can see it 's always reacting this is not a dead body this is a body who basically in this particular case feels the force and tries to protect its head only i think it 's quite a big blow again you feel kind of sorry for that thing and we 've seen it so many times now that we do n't really care any more there are much worse videos than this by the way which i have taken out but â€¦ now here 's another one what people wanted as a behavior was to have an explosion a strong force applied to the character and have the character react to it in midair so that you do n't have a character that looks limp but actually a character that you can use in an action film straight away that looks kind of alive in midair as well so this character is going to be hit by a force it 's going to realize it 's in the air and it 's going to try and well stick out its arm in the direction where it 's landing that 's one angle ; here 's another angle we now think that the realism we 're achieving with this is good enough to be used in films and let 's just have a look at a slightly different visualization this is something i just got last night from an animation studio in london who are using our software and experimenting with it right now so this is exactly the same behavior that you saw but in a slightly better rendered version so if you look at the character carefully you see there are lots of body movements going on none of which you have to animate like in the old days animators had to actually animate them this is all happening automatically in the simulation this is a slightly different angle and again a slow motion version of this this is incredibly quick this is happening in real time you can run this simulation in real time in front of your eyes change it if you want to and you get the animation straight out of it at the moment doing something like this by hand would take you probably a couple of days this is another behavior they requested i 'm not quite sure why but we 've done it anyway it 's a very simple behavior that shows you the power of this approach in this case the character 's hands are fixed to a particular point in space and all we 've told the character to do is to struggle and it looks organic it looks realistic you feel kind of sorry for the guy it 's even worse -- and that is another video i just got last night -- if you render that a bit more realistically now i 'm showing this to you just to show you how organic it actually can feel how realistic it can look and this is all a physical simulation of the body using ai to drive virtual muscles in that body now one thing which we did for a laugh was to create a slightly more complex stunt scene and one of the most famous stunts is the one where james bond jumps off a dam in switzerland and then is caught by a bungee got a very short clip here yes you can just about see it here in this case they were using a real stunt man it was a very dangerous stunt it was just voted i think in the sunday times as one of the most impressive stunts now we 've just tried and -- looked at our character and asked ourselves " can we do that ourselves as well " can we use the physical simulation of the character use artificial intelligence put that artificial intelligence into the character drive virtual muscles simulate the way he jumps off the dam and then skydive afterwards and have him caught by a bungee afterwards we did that it took about altogether just two hours pretty much to create the simulation and that 's what it looks like here now this could do with a bit more work it 's still very early stages and we pretty much just did this for a laugh just to see what we 'd get out of it but what we found over the past few months is that this approach -- that we 're pretty much standard upon -- is incredibly powerful we are ourselves surprised what you actually get out of the simulations there 's very often very surprising behavior that you did n't predict before there 's so many things we can do with this right now the first thing as i said is going to be virtual stuntmen several studios are using this software now to produce virtual stuntmen and they 're going to hit the screen quite soon actually for some major productions the second thing is video games with this technology video games will look different and they will feel very different for the first time you 'll have actors that really feel very interactive that have real bodies that really react i think that 's going to be incredibly exciting probably starting with sports games which are going to become much more interactive but i particularly am really excited about using this technology in online worlds like there for example that tom melcher has shown us the degree of interactivity you 're going to get is totally different i think from what you 're getting right now a third thing we are looking at and very interested in is simulation we 've been approached by several simulation companies but one project we 're particularly excited about which we 're starting next month is to use our technology -- and in particular the walking technology -- to help aid surgeons who work on children with cerebral palsy to predict the outcome of operations on these children as you probably know it 's very difficult to predict what the outcome of an operation is if you try and correct the gait the classic quote is i think it 's unpredictable at best is what people think right now is the outcome now what we want to do with our software is allow our surgeons to have a tool we 're going to simulate the gait of a particular child and the surgeon can then work on that simulation and try out different ways to improve that gait before he actually commits to an actual surgery that 's one project we 're particularly excited about and that 's going to start next month just finally this is only just the beginning we can only do several behaviors right now the ai is n't good enough to simulate a full human body the body yes but not all the motor skills that we have and i think we 're only there if we can have something like ballet dancing right now we do n't have that but i 'm very sure that we will be able to do that at some stage we do have one unintentional dancer actually the last thing i 'm going to show you this was an ai contour that was produced and evolved -- half-evolved i should say -- to produce balance basically so you kick the guy and the guy 's supposed to counter-balance that 's what we thought was going to come out of this but this is what emerged out of it in the end bizarrely this thing does n't have a head i 'm not quite sure why so this was not something we actually put in there he just started to create that dance himself he 's actually a better dancer than i am i have to say and what you see after a while -- i think he even goes into a climax right at the end so that all happened automatically we did n't put that in there that 's just the simulation creating this itself basically so it 's just -- thanks not quite john travolta yet but we 're working on that as well thanks ca : incredible that was really incredible tr : thanks hello voicemail my old friend i 've called for tech support again i ignored my boss ' warning i called on a monday morning now it 's evening and my dinner first grew cold -- and then grew mold i 'm still on hold i 'm listening to the sounds of silence i do n't think you understand i think your phone lines are unmanned i punched every touch tone i was told but i still spent 18 hours on hold it 's not enough your software crashed my mac and it constantly hangs and bombs -- it erased my roms ! now the mac makes the sounds of silence in my dreams i fantasize of wreaking vengeance on you guys say your motorcycle crashes blood comes gushing from your gashes with your fading strength you call 9-1-1 and you pray for a trained md but you get me and you listen to the sounds of silence thank you good evening and welcome to " spot the ted presenter who used to be a broadway accompanist " ok when i was offered the times column six years ago the deal was like this : you 'll be sent the coolest hottest slickest new gadgets every week it 'll arrive at your door you get to try them out play with them evaluate them until the novelty wears out before you have to send them back and you 'll get paid for it you can think about it if you want i 've always been a technology nut and i absolutely love it the job though came with one small downside and that is : they intended to publish my email address at the end of every column and what i 've noticed is -- first of all you get an incredible amount of email if you ever are feeling lonely get a new york times column because you will get hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of emails and the email i 'm getting a lot today is about frustration people are feeling like things -- ok i just had an alarm come up on my screen lucky you ca n't see it people are feeling overwhelmed they 're feeling like it 's too much technology too fast it may be good technology but i feel like there 's not enough of a support structure there 's not enough help there 's not enough thought put into the design of it to make it easy and enjoyable to use one time i wrote a column about my efforts to reach dell technical support and within 12 hours there were 700 messages from readers on the feedback boards on the times website from users saying " me too ! " and " here 's my tale of woe " i call it " software rage " and man let me tell you whoever figures out how to make money off of this frustration will -- oh how did that get up there just kidding ok so why is the problem accelerating part of the problem is ironically because the industry has put so much thought into making things easier to use i 'll show you what i mean this is what the computer interface used to look like dos over the years it 's gotten easier to use this is the original mac operating system reagan was president madonna was still a brunette and the entire operating system -- this is the good part -- the entire operating system fit in 211k you could n't put the mac os 10 logo in 211k ! so the irony is that as these things became easier to use a less technical broader audience was coming into contact with this equipment for the first time i once had the distinct privilege of sitting in on the apple call center for a day the guy had a duplicate headset for me to listen to and the calls that -- you know how they say " your call may be recorded for quality assurance " mm-mmm your call may be recorded so that they can collect the funniest dumb user stories and pass them around on a cd which they do and i have a copy it 's in your tedgift bag no no with your voices on it ! some of the stories are just so classic and yet so understandable a woman called apple to complain that her mouse was squeaking -- making a squeaking noise and the technician said " well ma'am what do you mean your mouse is squeaking " she says " all i can tell you is that it squeaks louder the faster i move it across the screen " and the technician 's like " ma'am you 've got the mouse up against the screen " she goes " well the message said 'click here to continue ' " well if you like that one how much time have we got another one a guy called -- this is absolutely true ! -- his computer had crashed and he told the technician he could n't restart it no matter how many times he typed 11 and the technician said " what why are you typing 11 " he said " the message says 'error type 11 ' " so we must admit that some of the blame falls squarely at the feet of the users but why is the technical overload crisis the complexity crisis accelerating now in the hardware world it 's because we the consumers want everything to be smaller smaller smaller so the gadgets are getting tinier and tinier but our fingers are essentially staying the same size so it gets to be more and more of a challenge software is subject to another primal force : the mandate to release more and more versions when you buy a piece of software it 's not like buying a vase or a candy bar where you own it it 's more like joining a club where you pay dues every year and every year they say " we 've added more features and we 'll sell it to you for $ 99 " i know one guy who 's spent $ 4,000 just on photoshop over the years and software companies make 35 percent of their revenue from just these software upgrades i call it the software upgrade paradox -- which is that if you improve a piece of software enough times you eventually ruin it i mean microsoft word was last just a word processor in you know the eisenhower administration but what 's the alternative microsoft actually did this experiment they said " well wait a minute everyone complains that we 're adding so many features let 's create a word processor that 's just a word processor simple pure does not do web pages is not a database " and it came out it was called microsoft write and none of you are nodding in acknowledgment because it died it tanked no one ever bought it i call this the sport utility principle people like to surround themselves with unnecessary power right they do n't need the database and the website but they 're like " well i 'll upgrade because i might you know i might need that someday " so the problem is : as you add more features where are they going to go where are you going to stick them you only have so many design tools you can do buttons ; you can do sliders pop-up menus sub-menus but if you 're not careful about how you choose you wind up with this this is an un-retouched -- this is not a joke -- un-retouched photo of microsoft word the copy that you have with all the toolbars open you 've obviously never opened all the toolbars but all you have to type in is this little teeny window down here and we 've arrived at the age of interface matrices where there are so many features and options you have to do two dimensions you know : a vertical and a horizontal you guys all complained about how microsoft word is always bulleting your lists and underlining your links automatically the off switch is in there somewhere i 'm telling you it 's there ! part of the art of designing a simple good interface is knowing when to use which one of these features here is the log off dialog box for windows 2000 there are only four choices so why are they in a pop-up menu it 's not like the rest of the screen is so full of other components that you need to collapse the choices they could have put them all out in view here 's apple 's take on the exact same dialog box thank you -- yes i designed the dialog box no no no already we can see that apple and microsoft have a severely divergent approach to software design microsoft 's approach to simplicity tends to be : let 's break it down ; let 's just make it more steps there are these " wizards " everywhere and you know there 's a new version of windows coming out this fall if they continue at this pace there 's absolutely no telling where they might wind up " welcome to the type-a-word wizard " ok i 'll bite let 's click " next " to continue from the drop-down menu choose the first letter you want to type ok so there is a limit that we do n't want to cross so what is the answer how do you pack in all these features in a simple intelligent way i believe in consistency with possible real-world equivalents trashcan folder when possible label things mostly but i beg of the designers here to break all those rules if they violate the biggest rule of all which is intelligence now what do i mean by that i 'm going to give you some examples where intelligence makes something not consistent but it 's better if you are buying something on the web you 're supposed to put in your address and you 're supposed to choose which country you 're from ok there are 200 countries in the world we like to think of the internet as a global village i 'm sorry ; it 's not one yet it 's mainly like the united states europe and japan so why is united states in the " u " s you have to scroll like seven screens-full to get to it now it would be inconsistent to put united states first but it would be intelligent this one 's been touched on before but why in god 's name do you shut down a windows pc by clicking a button called " start " here 's another pet one of mine : you have a printer most of the time you want to print one copy of your document in page order on that printer so why in god 's name do you see this every time you print it 's like a 747 shuttle cockpit and one of the buttons at the bottom you 'll notice is not " print " now i 'm not saying that apple is the only company who has embraced the cult of simplicity palm is also especially in the old days wonderful about this i actually got to speak to palm when they were flying high in the '90s and after the talk i met one of the employees he says " nice talk " and i said " thank you what do you do here " he said " i 'm a tap counter " i 'm like " you 're a what " he goes " well jeff hawkins the ceo says 'if any task on the palm pilot takes more than three taps of the stylus it 's too long and it has to be redesigned ' so i 'm the tap counter " i 'm going to show you an example of a company that does not have a tap counter this is microsoft word when you want to create a new blank document in word -- it could happen ! -- you go up to the file menu and you choose " new " now what happens when you choose " new " do you get a new blank document you do not on the opposite side of the monitor a task bar appears and somewhere in those links -- by the way not at the top -- somewhere in those links is a button that makes you a new document that is a company not counting taps you know i do n't want to just stand here and make fun of microsoft â€¦ audience : go on david pogue : yes i do the bill gates song ! i 've been a geek forever and i wrote the very first dos i put my software and ibm together ; i got profit and they got the loss i write the code that makes the whole world run i 'm gettin ' royalties from everyone sometimes it 's garbage but the press is snowed you buy the box ; i 'll sell the code every software company is doing microsoft 's r & amp ; d you ca n't keep a good idea down these days even windows is a hack we 're kind of based loosely on the mac so it 's big so it 's slow you 've got nowhere to go i 'm not doing this for praise i write the code that fits the world today big mediocrity in every way we 've entered planet domination mode you 'll have no choice ; you 'll buy my code i am bill gates and i write the code but actually i believe there are really two microsofts there 's the old one responsible for windows and office they 're dying to throw the whole thing out and start fresh but they ca n't they 're locked in because so many add-ons and other company stuff locks into the old 1982 chassis but there 's also a new microsoft that 's really doing good simple interface designs i liked the media center pc i liked the microsoft spot watch the wireless watch flopped miserably in the market but it was n't because it was n't simply and beautifully designed let 's put it this way : would you pay $ 10 a month to have a watch that has to be recharged every night like your cell phone and stops working when you leave your area code the signs might indicate that the complexity crunch is only going to get worse so is there any hope the screens are getting smaller people are illuminating putting manuals in the boxes the things are coming out at a faster pace it 's funny -- when steve jobs came back to apple in 1997 after 12 years away it was the macworld expo -- he came to the stage in that black turtleneck and jeans and he sort of did this the crowd went wild but i 'm like where have i seen this before i had just seen the movie " evita " -- -- with madonna and i 'm like you know what i 've got to do one about steve jobs it wo n't be easy you 'll think i 'm strange when i try to explain why i 'm back after telling the press apple 's future is black you wo n't believe me all that you see is a kid in his teens who started out in a garage with only a buddy named woz you try rhyming with garage ! do n't cry for me cupertino the truth is i never left you i know the ropes now know what the tricks are i made a fortune over at pixar do n't cry for me cupertino i 've still got the drive and vision i still wear sandals in any weather it 's just that these days they 're gucci leather thank you so steve jobs had always believed in simplicity and elegance and beauty and the truth is for years i was a little depressed -- because americans obviously did not value it because the mac had three percent market share and windows had 95 percent market share people did not think it was worth putting a price on it so i was a little depressed -- then i heard al gore 's talk and i realized i did n't know the meaning of depressed but it turns out i was wrong right because the ipod came out and it violated every bit of common wisdom other products cost less other products had more features they had voice recorders and fm transmitters the other products were backed by microsoft with an open standard not apple 's propriety standard but the ipod won ! this is the one they wanted the lesson was : simplicity sells and there are signs that the industry is getting the message this is a little company that 's done very well with simplicity and elegance the sonos thing -- it 's catching on i 've got just a couple examples physically a really cool elegant thinking coming along lately when you have a digital camera how do you get the pictures back to your computer well you either haul around a usb cable or you buy a card reader and haul that around either one you 're going to lose what i do is i take out the memory card and i fold it in half revealing usb contacts i just stick it in the computer offload the pictures put it right back in the camera i never have to lose anything here 's another example chris you 're the source of all power will you be my power plug chris anderson : oh yeah dp : hold that and do n't let go you might have seen this : this is apple 's new laptop this is the power cord it hooks on like this and i 'm sure every one of you has done this at some point in your lives or one of your children you walk along -- and i 'm about to pull this onto the floor i do n't care it 's a loaner here we go whoa ! it 's magnetic it does n't pull the laptop onto the floor in my very last example -- i do a lot of my work using speech recognition software and you have to be kind of quiet because the software is nervous " speech recognition software is really great for doing emails very quickly period like i get hundreds of them a day period and it 's not just what i dictate that it writes down period i also use this feature called voice macros period " correct " dissuade " " not just " okay this is not an ideal situation because it 's getting the echo from the hall and stuff but the point is : i can respond to people very quickly by saying a short word and having it write out a much longer thing so if somebody sends me a fan letter i 'll say " thanks for that " and conversely if somebody sends me hate mail -- which happens daily -- i say " piss off " so that 's my dirty little secret do n't tell anyone so the point is this a really interesting story this is version eight of this software and do you know what they put in version eight no new features it 's never happened before in software ! the company put no new features they just said " we 'll make the software work right " right because for years people had bought this software tried it out -- 95 percent accuracy was all they got which means one in 20 words is wrong -- and they put it in their drawer and the company got sick of that so they said " this version we 're not going to do anything but make sure it 's darned accurate " and so that 's what they did this cult of doing things right is starting to spread my final advice for those of you who are consumers of this technology : remember if it does n't work it 's not necessarily you ok it could be the design of the thing you 're using be aware in life of good design and bad design and if you 're among the people who create the stuff easy is hard pre-sweat the details for your audience count the taps remember the hard part is not deciding what features to add -- it 's deciding what to leave out and best of all your motivation is : simplicity sells ca : bravo dp : thank you very much ca : hear hear ! so i 'm going to talk today about collecting stories in some unconventional ways this is a picture of me from a very awkward stage in my life you might enjoy the awkwardly tight cut-off pajama bottoms with balloons anyway it was a time when i was mainly interested in collecting imaginary stories so this is a picture of me holding one of the first watercolor paintings i ever made and recently i 've been much more interested in collecting stories from reality -- so real stories and specifically i 'm interested in collecting my own stories stories from the internet and then recently stories from life which is kind of a new area of work that i 've been doing recently so i 'll be talking about each of those today so first of all my own stories these are two of my sketchbooks i have many of these books and i 've been keeping them for about the last eight or nine years they accompany me wherever i go in my life and i fill them with all sorts of things records of my lived experience : so watercolor paintings drawings of what i see dead flowers dead insects pasted ticket stubs rusting coins business cards writings and in these books you can find these short little glimpses of moments and experiences and people that i meet and you know after keeping these books for a number of years i started to become very interested in collecting not only my own personal artifacts but also the artifacts of other people so i started collecting found objects this is a photograph i found lying in a gutter in new york city about 10 years ago on the front you can see the tattered black-and-white photo of a woman 's face and on the back it says " to judy the girl with the bill bailey voice have fun in whatever you do " and i really loved this idea of the partial glimpse into somebody 's life as opposed to knowing the whole story just knowing a little bit of the story and then letting your own mind fill in the rest and that idea of a partial glimpse is something that will come back in a lot of the work i 'll be showing later today so around this time i was studying computer science at princeton university and i noticed that it was suddenly possible to collect these sorts of personal artifacts not just from street corners but also from the internet and that suddenly people en masse were leaving scores and scores of digital footprints online that told stories of their private lives blog posts photographs thoughts feelings opinions all of these things were being expressed by people online and leaving behind trails so i started to write computer programs that study very very large sets of these online footprints one such project is about a year and a half old it 's called " we feel fine " this is a project that scans the world 's newly posted blog entries every two or three minutes searching for occurrences of the phrases " i feel " and " i am feeling " and when it finds one of those phrases it grabs the full sentence up to the period and also tries to identify demographic information about the author so their gender their age their geographic location and what the weather conditions were like when they wrote that sentence it collects about 20,000 such sentences a day and it 's been running for about a year and a half having collected over 10 and a half million feelings now this is then how they 're presented these dots here represent some of the english-speaking world 's feelings from the last few hours each dot being a single sentence stated by a single blogger and the color of each dot corresponds to the type of feeling inside so the bright ones are happy and the dark ones are sad and the diameter of each dot corresponds to the length of the sentence inside so the small ones are short and the bigger ones are longer " i feel fine with the body i 'm in there 'll be no easy excuse for why i still feel uncomfortable being close to my boyfriend " from a twenty-two-year-old in japan " i got this on some trading locally but really do n't feel like screwing with wiring and crap " also some of the feelings contain photographs in the blog posts and when that happens these montage compositions are automatically created which consist of the sentence and images being combined and any of these can be opened up to reveal the sentence inside " i feel good " " i feel rough now and i probably gained 100,000 pounds but it was worth it " " i love how they were able to preserve most in everything that makes you feel close to nature -- butterflies man-made forests limestone caves and hey even a huge python " so the next movement is called mobs this provides a slightly more statistical look at things this is showing the world 's most common feelings overall right now dominated by better then bad then good then guilty and so on weather causes the feelings to assume the physical traits of the weather they represent so the sunny ones swirl around the cloudy ones float along the rainy ones fall down and the snowy ones flutter to the ground you can also stop a raindrop and open the feeling inside finally location causes the feelings to move to their spots on a world map giving you a sense of their geographic distribution so i 'll show you now some of my favorite montages from " we feel fine " these are the images that are automatically constructed " i feel like i 'm diagonally parked in a parallel universe " " i 've kissed numerous other boys and it has n't felt good the kisses felt messy and wrong but kissing lucas feels beautiful and almost spiritual " " i can feel my cancer grow " " i feel pretty " " i feel skinny but i 'm not " " i 'm 23 and a recovering meth and heroin addict and feel absolutely blessed to still be alive " " i ca n't wait to see them racing for the first time at daytona next month because i feel the need for speed " " i feel sassy " " i feel so sexy in this new wig " as you can see " we feel fine " collects very very small-scale personal stories sometimes stories as short as two or three words so really even challenging the notion of what can be considered a story and recently i 've become interested in diving much more deeply into a single story and that 's led me to doing some work with the physical world not with the internet and only using the internet at the very last moment as a presentation medium so these are some newer projects that actually are n't even launched publicly yet the first such one is called " the whale hunt " last may i spent nine days living up in barrow alaska the northernmost settlement in the united states with a family of inupiat eskimos documenting their annual spring whale hunt this is the whaling camp here we 're about six miles from shore camping on five and a half feet of thick frozen pack ice and that water that you see there is the open lead and through that lead bowhead whales migrate north each springtime and the eskimo community basically camps out on the edge of the ice here waits for a whale to come close enough to attack and when it does it throws a harpoon at it and then hauls the whale up under the ice and cuts it up and that would provide the community 's food supply for a long time so i went up there and i lived with these guys out in their whaling camp here and photographed the entire experience beginning with the taxi ride to newark airport in new york and ending with the butchering of the second whale seven and a half days later i photographed that entire experience at five-minute intervals so every five minutes i took a photograph when i was awake with the camera around my neck when i was sleeping with a tripod and a timer and then in moments of high adrenaline like when something exciting was happening i would up that photographic frequency to as many as 37 photographs in five minutes so what this created was a photographic heartbeat that sped up and slowed down more or less matching the changing pace of my own heartbeat that was the first concept here the second concept was to use this experience to think about the fundamental components of any story what are the things that make up a story so stories have characters stories have concepts stories take place in a certain area they have contexts they have colors what do they look like they have time when did it take place dates -- when did it occur and in the case of the whale hunt also this idea of an excitement level the thing about stories though in most of the existing mediums that we 're accustomed to -- things like novels radio photographs movies even lectures like this one -- we 're very accustomed to this idea of the narrator or the camera position some kind of omniscient external body through whose eyes you see the story we 're very used to this but if you think about real life it 's not like that at all i mean in real life things are much more nuanced and complex and there 's all of these overlapping stories intersecting and touching each other and so i thought it would be interesting to build a framework to surface those types of stories so in the case of " the whale hunt " how could we extract something like the story of simeon and crawford involving the concepts of wildlife tools and blood taking place on the arctic ocean dominated by the color red happening around 10 a.m. on may 3 with an excitement level of high so how to extract this order of narrative from this larger story i built a web interface for viewing " the whale hunt " that attempts to do just this so these are all 3,214 pictures taken up there this is my studio in brooklyn this is the arctic ocean and the butchering of the second whale seven days later you can start to see some of the story here told by color so this red strip signifies the color of the wallpaper in the basement apartment where i was staying and things go white as we move out onto the arctic ocean introduction of red down here when whales are being cut up you can see a timeline showing you the exciting moments throughout the story these are organized chronologically wheel provides a slightly more playful version of the same so these are also all the photographs organized chronologically and any of these can be clicked and then the narrative is entered at that position so here i am sleeping on the airplane heading up to alaska that 's " moby dick " this is the food we ate this is in the patkotak 's family living room in their house in barrow the boxed wine they served us cigarette break outside -- i do n't smoke this is a really exciting sequence of me sleeping this is out at whale camp on the arctic ocean this graph that i 'm clicking down here is meant to be reminiscent of a medical heartbeat graph showing the exciting moments of adrenaline this is the ice starting to freeze over the snow fence they built and so what i 'll show you now is the ability to pull out sub-stories so here you see the cast these are all of the people in " the whale hunt " and the two whales that were killed down here and we could do something as arbitrary as say extract the story of rony involving the concepts of blood and whales and tools taking place on the arctic ocean at ahkivgaq camp with the heartbeat level of fast and now we 've whittled down that whole story to just 29 matching photographs and then we can enter the narrative at that position and you can see rony cutting up the whale here these whales are about 40 feet long and weighing over 40 tons and they provide the food source for the community for much of the year skipping ahead a bit more here this is rony on the whale carcass they use no chainsaws or anything ; it 's entirely just blades and an incredibly efficient process this is the guys on the rope pulling open the carcass this is the muktuk or the blubber all lined up for community distribution it 's baleen moving on so what i 'm going to tell you about next is a very new thing it 's not even a project yet so just yesterday i flew in here from singapore and before that i was spending two weeks in bhutan the small himalayan kingdom nestled between tibet and india and i was doing a project there about happiness interviewing a lot of local people so bhutan has this really wacky thing where they base most of their high-level governmental decisions around the concept of gross national happiness instead of gross domestic product and they 've been doing this since the '70s and it leads to just a completely different value system it 's an incredibly non-materialistic culture where people do n't have a lot but they 're incredibly happy so i went around and i talked to people about some of these ideas so i did a number of things i asked people a number of set questions and took a number of set photographs and interviewed them with audio and also took pictures i would start by asking people to rate their happiness between one and 10 which is kind of inherently absurd and then when they answered i would inflate that number of balloons and give them that number of balloons to hold so you have some really happy person holding 10 balloons and some really sad soul holding one balloon but you know even holding one balloon is like kind of happy and then i would ask them a number of questions like what was the happiest day in their life what makes them happy and then finally i would ask them to make a wish and when they made a wish i would write their wish onto one of the balloons and take a picture of them holding it so i 'm going to show you now just a few brief snippets of some of the interviews that i did some of the people i spoke with this is an 11-year-old student he was playing cops and robbers with his friends running around town and they all had plastic toy guns his wish was to become a police officer he was getting started early those were his hands i took pictures of everybody 's hands because i think you can often tell a lot about somebody from how their hands look i took a portrait of everybody and asked everybody to make a funny face a 17-year-old student her wish was to have been born a boy she thinks that women have a pretty tough go of things in bhutan and it 's a lot easier if you 're a boy a 28-year-old cell phone shop owner if you knew what paro looked like you 'd understand how amazing it is that there 's a cell phone shop there he wanted to help poor people a 53-year-old farmer she was chaffing wheat and that pile of wheat behind her had taken her about a week to make she wanted to keep farming until she dies you can really start to see the stories told by the hands here she was wearing this silver ring that had the word " love " engraved on it and she 'd found it in the road somewhere a 16-year-old quarry worker this guy was breaking rocks with a hammer in the hot sunlight but he just wanted to spend his life as a farmer a 21-year-old monk he was very happy he wanted to live a long life at the monastery he had this amazing series of hairs growing out of a mole on the left side of his face which i 'm told is very good luck he was kind of too shy to make a funny face a 16-year-old student she wanted to become an independent woman i asked her about that and she said she meant that she does n't want to be married because in her opinion when you get married in bhutan as a woman your chances to live an independent life kind of end and so she had no interest in that a 24-year-old truck driver there are these terrifyingly huge indian trucks that come careening around one-lane roads with two-lane traffic with 3,000-foot drop-offs right next to the road and he was driving one of these trucks but all he wanted was to just live a comfortable life like other people a 24-year-old road sweeper i caught her on her lunch break she 'd built a little fire to keep warm right next to the road her wish was to marry someone with a car she wanted a change in her life she lives in a little worker 's camp right next to the road and she wanted a different lot on things an 81-year-old itinerant farmer i saw this guy on the side of the road and he actually does n't have a home he travels from farm to farm each day trying to find work and then he tries to sleep at whatever farm he gets work at so his wish was to come with me so that he had somewhere to live he had this amazing knife that he pulled out of his gho and started brandishing when i asked him to make a funny face it was all good-natured a 10-year-old he wanted to join a school and learn to read but his parents did n't have enough money to send him to school he was eating this orange sugary candy that he kept dipping his fingers into and since there was so much saliva on his hands this orange paste started to form on his palms a 37-year-old road worker one of the more touchy political subjects in bhutan is the use of indian cheap labor that they import from india to build the roads and then they send these people home once the roads are built so these guys were in a worker 's gang mixing up asphalt one morning on the side of the highway his wish was to make some money and open a store a 75-year-old farmer she was selling oranges on the side of the road i asked her about her wish and she said " you know maybe i 'll live maybe i 'll die but i do n't have a wish " she was chewing betel nut which caused her teeth over the years to turn very red finally this is a 26-year-old nun i spoke to her wish was to make a pilgrimage to tibet i asked her how long she planned to live in the nunnery and she said " well you know of course it 's impermanent but my plan is to live here until i 'm 30 and then enter a hermitage " and i said " you mean like a cave " and she said " yeah like a cave " and i said " wow and how long will you live in the cave " and she said " well you know i think i 'd kind of like to live my whole life in the cave " i just thought that was amazing i mean she spoke in a way -- with amazing english and amazing humor and amazing laughter -- that made her seem like somebody i could have bumped into on the streets of new york or in vermont where i 'm from but here she had been living in a nunnery for the last seven years i asked her a little bit more about the cave and what she planned would happen once she went there you know what if she saw the truth after just one year what would she do for the next 35 years in her life and this is what she said woman : i think i 'm going to stay for 35 maybe -- maybe i 'll die jonathan harris : maybe you 'll die woman : yes jh : 10 years woman : yes yes jh : 10 years that 's a long time woman : yes not maybe one 10 years maybe i can die within one year or something like that jh : are you hoping to woman : ah because you know it 's impermanent jh : yeah but -- yeah ok. do you hope -- would you prefer to live in the cave for 40 years or to live for one year woman : but i prefer for maybe 40 to 50 jh : 40 to 50 yeah woman : yes from then i 'm going to the heaven jh : well i wish you the best of luck with it woman : thank you jh : i hope it 's everything that you hope it will be so thank you again so much woman : you 're most welcome jh : so if you caught that she said she hoped to die when she was around 40 that was enough life for her so the last thing we did very quickly is i took all those wish balloons -- there were 117 interviews 117 wishes -- and i brought them up to a place called dochula which is a mountain pass in bhutan at 10,300 feet one of the more sacred places in bhutan and up there there are thousands of prayer flags that people have spread out over the years and we re-inflated all of the balloons put them up on a string and hung them up there among the prayer flags and they 're actually still flying up there today so if any of you have any bhutan travel plans in the near future you can go check these out here are some images from that we said a buddhist prayer so that all these wishes could come true you can start to see some familiar balloons here " to make some money and to open a store " was the indian road worker thanks very much i get asked a lot what the difference between my work is and typical pentagon long-range strategic planners and the answer i like to offer is what they typically do is they think about the future of wars in the context of war and what i 've spent 15 years doing in this business -- and it 's taken me almost 14 to figure it out -- is i think about the future of wars in the context of everything else so i tend to specialize on the scene between war and peace the material i 'm going to show you is one idea from a book with a lot of ideas it 's the one that takes me around the world right now interacting with foreign militaries quite a bit the material was generated in two years of work i did for the secretary of defense thinking about a new national grand strategy for the united states i 'm going to present a problem and try to give you an answer here 's my favorite bonehead concept from the 1990s in the pentagon : the theory of anti-access area-denial asymmetrical strategies why do we call it that because it 's got all those a 's lined up i guess this is gobbledygook for if the united states fights somebody we 're going to be huge they 're going to be small and if they try to fight us in the traditional straight-up manner we 're going to kick their ass which is why people do n't try to do that any more i met the last air force general who had actually shot down an enemy plane in combat he 's now a one star general that 's how distant we are from even meeting an air force willing to fly against ours so that overmatched capability creates problems -- catastrophic successes the white house calls them and we 're trying to figure that out because it is an amazing capability the question is what 's the good you can do with it ok the theory of anti-access area-denial asymmetrical strategies -- gobbledygook that we sell to congress because if we just told them we can kick anybody 's asses they would n't buy us all the stuff we want so we say area-denial anti-access asymmetrical strategies and their eyes glaze over and they say " will you build it in my district " here 's my parody and it ai n't much of one let 's talk about a battle space i do n't know taiwan straits 2025 let 's talk about an enemy embedded within that battle space i do n't know the million man swim the united states has to access that battle space instantaneously they throw up anti-access area-denial asymmetrical strategies a banana peel on the tarmac trojan horses on our computer networks reveal all our achilles ' heels instantly we say " china it 's yours " prometheus approach largely a geographic definition focuses almost exclusively on the start of conflict we field the first-half team in a league that insists on keeping score until the end of the game that 's the problem we can run the score up against anybody and then get our asses kicked in the second half -- what they call fourth generation warfare here 's the way i like to describe it instead there is no battle space the u.s. military can not access they said we could n't do afghanistan we did it with ease they said we could n't do iraq we did it with 150 combat casualties in six weeks we did it so fast we were n't prepared for their collapse there is nobody we ca n't take down the question is what do you do with the power so there 's no trouble accessing battle spaces what we have trouble accessing is the transition space that must naturally follow and creating the peace space that allows us to move on problem is the defense department over here beats the hell out of you the state department over here says " come on boy i know you can make it " and that poor country runs off that ledge does that cartoon thing and then drops this is not about overwhelming force but proportional force it 's about non-lethal technologies because if you fire real ammo into a crowd of women and children rioting you 're going to lose friends very quickly this is not about projecting power but about staying power which is about legitimacy with the locals who do you access in this transition space you have to create internal partners you have to access coalition partners we asked the indians for 17,000 peace keepers i know their senior leadership they wanted to give it to us but they said to us " you know what in that transition space you 're mostly hat not enough cattle we do n't think you can pull it off we 're not going to give you our 17,000 peace keepers for fodder " we asked the russians for 40,000 they said no i was in china in august i said " you should have 50,000 peace keepers in iraq it 's your oil not ours " which is the truth it 's their oil and the chinese said to me " dr. barnett you 're absolutely right in a perfect world we 'd have 50,000 there but it 's not a perfect world and your administration is n't getting us any closer " but we have trouble accessing our outcomes we lucked out frankly on the selection we face different opponents across these three and it 's time to start admitting you ca n't ask the same 19-year-old to do it all day in and day out it 's just too damn hard we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war we do n't do the everything else so well frankly we do it better than anybody and we still suck at it we have a brilliant secretary of war we do n't have a secretary of everything else because if we did that guy would be in front of the senate still testifying over abu ghraib the problem is he does n't exist there is no secretary of everything else i think we have an unparalleled capacity to wage war i call that the leviathan force what we need to build is a force for the everything else i call them the system administrators what i think this really represents is lack of an a to z rule set for the world as a whole for processing politically bankrupt states we have one for processing economically bankrupt states it 's the imf sovereign bankruptcy plan ok we argue about it every time we use it argentina just went through it broke a lot of rules they got out on the far end we said " fine do n't worry about it " it 's transparent a certain amount of certainty gives the sense of a non-zero outcome we do n't have one for processing politically bankrupt states that frankly everybody wants gone like saddam like mugabe like kim jong-il -- people who kill in hundreds of thousands or millions like the 250,000 dead so far in sudan what would an a to z system look like i 'm going to distinguish between what i call front half and back half and let 's call this red line i do n't know mission accomplished what we have extant right now at the beginning of this system is the u.n. security council as a grand jury what can they do they can indict your ass they can debate it they can write it on a piece of paper they can put it in an envelope and mail it to you and then say in no uncertain terms " please cut that out " that gets you about four million dead in central africa over the 1990s that gets you 250,000 dead in the sudan in the last 15 months everybody 's got to answer their grandchildren some day what you did about the holocaust in africa and you better have an answer we do n't have anything to translate that will into action what we do have is the u.s.-enabled leviathan force that says " you want me to take that guy down i 'll take that guy down i 'll do it on tuesday it will cost you 20 billion dollars " but here 's the deal as soon as i ca n't find anybody else to air out i leave the scene immediately that 's called the powell doctrine way downstream we have the international criminal court they love to put them on trial they 've got milosevic right now what are we missing a functioning executive that will translate will into action because we do n't have it every time we lead one of these efforts we have to whip ourselves into this imminent threat thing we have n't faced an imminent threat since the cuban missile crisis in 1962 but we use this language from a bygone era to scare ourselves into doing something because we 're a democracy and that 's what it takes and if that does n't work we scream " he 's got a gun ! " just as we rush in and then we look over the body and we find an old cigarette lighter and we say " jesus it was dark " do you want to do it france france says " no but i do like to criticize you after the fact " what we need downstream is a great power enabled -- what i call that sys admin force we should have had 250,000 troops streaming into iraq on the heels of that leviathan sweeping towards baghdad what do you get then no looting no military disappearing no arms disappearing no ammo disappearing no muqtada al-sadr -- i 'm wrecking his bones -- no insurgency talk to anybody who was over there in the first six months we had six months to feel the lob to get the job done and we dicked around for six months and then they turned on us why because they just got fed up they saw what we did to saddam they said " you 're that powerful you can resurrect this country you 're america " what we need is an international reconstruction fund -- sebastian mallaby washington post great idea model on the imf instead of passing the hat each time ok where are we going to find this guy g20 that 's easy check out their agenda since 9/11 all security dominated they 're going to decide up front how the money gets spent just like in the imf you vote according to how much money you put in the kitty here 's my challenge to the defense department you 've got to build this force you 've got to seed this force you 've got to track coalition partners create a record of success you will get this model you tell me it 's too hard to do i 'll walk this dog right through that six part series on the balkans we did it just like that i 'm talking about regularizing it making it transparent would you like mugabe gone would you like kim jong-il who 's killed about two million people would you like him gone would you like a better system this is why it matters to the military they 've been experiencing an identity crisis since the end of the cold war i 'm not talking about the difference between reality and desire which i can do because i 'm not inside the beltway i 'm talking about the 1990s the berlin wall falls we do desert storm the split starts to emerge between those in the military who see a future they can live with and those who see a future that starts to scare them like the u.s. submarine community which watches the soviet navy disappear overnight ah ! so they start moving from reality towards desire and they create their own special language to describe their voyage of self-discovery and self-actualization the problem is you need a big sexy opponent to fight against and if you ca n't find one you 've got to make one up china all grown up going to be a looker ! the rest of the military got dragged down into the muck across the 1990s and they developed this very derisive term to describe it : military operations other than war i ask you who joins the military to do things other than war actually most of them jessica lynch never planned on shooting back most of them do n't pick up a rifle i maintain this is code inside the army for " we do n't want to do this " they spent the 1990s working the messy scene between globalized parts of the world what i call the core and the gap the clinton administration was n't interested in running this for eight years after screwing up the relationship on day one -- inauguration day with gays in the military -- which was deft so we were home alone for eight years and what did we do home alone we bought one military and we operated another it 's like the guy who goes to the doctor and says " doctor it hurts when i do this " the doctor says " stop doing that you idiot " i used to give this brief inside the pentagon in the early 1990s i 'd say " you 're buying one military and you 're operating another and eventually it 's going to hurt it 's wrong bad pentagon bad ! " and they 'd say " dr. barnett you are so right can you come back next year and remind us again " some people say 9/11 heals the rift -- jerks the long-term transformation gurus out of their 30,000 foot view of history drags them down in to the muck and says " you want a networked opponent i 've got one he 's everywhere go find him " it elevates mootw -- how we pronounce that acronym -- from crap to grand strategy because that 's how you 're going to shrink that gap some people put these two things together and they call it empire which i think is a boneheaded concept empire is about the enforcement of not just minimal rule sets which you can not do but maximum rule sets which you must do it 's not our system of governance never how we 've sought to interact with the outside world i prefer that phrase system administration we enforce the minimal rule sets for maintaining connectivity to the global economy certain bad things you can not do how this impacts the way we think about the future of war this is a concept which gets me vilified throughout the pentagon it makes me very popular as well everybody 's got an opinion going back to the beginning of our country -- historically defenses meant protection of the homeland security has meant everything else written into our constitution two different forces two different functions raise an army when you need it and maintain a navy for day-to-day connectivity a department of war a department of everything else a big stick a baton stick can of whup ass the networking force in 1947 we merged these two things together in the defense department our long-term rationale becomes we 're involved in a hair trigger stand off with the soviets to attack america is to risk blowing up the world we connected national security to international security with about a seven minute time delay that 's not our problem now they can kill three million in chicago tomorrow and we do n't go to the mattresses with nukes that 's the scary part the question is how do we reconnect american national security with global security to make the world a lot more comfortable and to embed and contextualize our employment of force around the planet what 's happened since is that bifurcation i described we talked about this going all the way back to the end of the cold war let 's have a department of war and a department of something else some people say " hell 9/11 did it for you " now we 've got a home game and an away game the department of homeland security is a strategic feel good measure it 's going to be the department of agriculture for the 21st century tsa -- thousands standing around just be grateful robert reed did n't shove that bomb up his ass because we 'd all be gay then i supported the war in iraq he was a bad guy with multiple priors it 's not like we had to find him actually killing somebody live to arrest him i knew we 'd kick ass in the war with the leviathan force i knew we 'd have a hard time with what followed but i know this organization does n't change until it experiences failure what do i mean by these two different forces this is the hobbesian force i love this force i do n't want to see it go that plus nukes rules out great power war this is the military the rest of the world wants us to build it 's why i travel all over the world talking to foreign militaries what does this mean it means you 've got to stop pretending you can do these two very disparate skill sets with the same 19-year-old switching back morning afternoon evening morning afternoon evening handing out aid shooting back handing out aid shooting back it 's too much the 19-year-olds get tired from the switching ok that force on the left you can train a 19-year-old to do that that force on the right is more like a 40-year-old cop you need the experience what does this mean in terms of operations the rule is going to be this that sys admin force is the force that never comes home does most of your work you break out that leviathan force only every so often but here 's the promise you make to the american public to your own people to the world you break out that leviathan force you promise you guarantee that you 're going to mount one hell of a -- immediately -- follow-on sys admin effort do n't plan for the war unless you plan to win the peace other differences leviathan traditional partners they all look like the brits and their former colonies including us i would remind you the rest -- wider array of partners international organizations non-governmental organizations private voluntary organizations contractors you 're not going to get away from that leviathan force it 's all about joint operations between the military services we 're done with that what we need to do is inter-agency operations which frankly condi rice was in charge of and i 'm amazed nobody asked her that question when she was confirmed i call the leviathan force your dad 's military i like them young male unmarried slightly pissed off i call the sys admin force your mom 's military it 's everything the man 's military hates gender balanced much more older educated married with children the force on the left up or out the force on the right in and out the force on the left respects posse comitatus restrictions on the use of force inside the u.s the force on the right 's going to obliterate it that 's where the national guard 's going to be the force on the left is never coming under the purview of the international criminal court sys admin force has to different definitions of network centricity one takes down networks one puts them up and you 've got to wage war here in such a way to facilitate that do we need a bigger budget do we need a draft to pull this off absolutely not i 've been told by the revolution of military affairs crowd for years we can do it faster cheaper smaller just as lethal i say " great i 'm going to take the sys admin budget out of your hide " here 's the larger point you 're going to build the sys admin force inside the u.s. military first but ultimately you 're going to civilianize it probably two thirds inter agency-ize it internationalize it so yes it begins inside the pentagon but over time it 's going to cross that river i have been to the mountain top i can see the future i may not live long enough to get you there but it 's going to happen we 're going to have a department of something else between war and peace last slide who gets custody of the kids this is where the marines in the audience get kind of tense and this is when they think about beating the crap out of me after the talk read max boon this is the history of the marines -- small wars small arms the marines are like my west highland terrier they get up every morning they want to dig a hole and they want to kill something i do n't want my marines handing out aid i want them to be marines that 's what keeps the sys admin force from being a pussy force it keeps it from being the u.n you shoot at these people the marines are going to come over and kill you department of navy strategic subs go this way surface combatants are over there and the news is they may actually be that small i call it the smart dust navy i tell young officers " you may command 500 ships in your career bad news is they may not have anybody on them " carriers go both ways because they 're a swing asset you 'll see the pattern -- airborne just like carriers armor goes this way here 's the dirty secret of the air force you can win by bombing but you need lots of these guys on the ground to win the peace shinseki was right with the argument air force strategic airlift goes both ways bombers fighters go over here special operations command down at tampa trigger-pullers go this way civil affairs that bastard child comes over here return to the army the point about the trigger-pullers and special operations command no off season these guys are always active they drop in do their business disappear see me now do n't talk about it later i was never here the world is my playground i want to keep trigger-pullers trigger-happy i want the rules to be as loose as possible because when the thing gets prevented in chicago with the three million dead that perverts our political system beyond all recognition these are the guys who are going to kill them first so it 's better off to have them make some mistakes along the way than to see that reserve component -- national guard reserves overwhelmingly sys admin how are you going to get them to work for this force most firemen in this country do it for free this is not about money this is about being up front with these guys and gals last point intelligence community -- the muscle and the defense agencies go this way what should be the cia open analytical open source should come over here the information you need to do this is not secret it 's not secret read that great piece in the new yorker about how our echo boomers 19 to 25 over in iraq taught each other how to do sys admin work over the internet in chat rooms they said " al qaeda could be listening " they said " well jesus they already know this stuff " take a gift in the left hand these are the sunglasses that do n't scare people simple stuff censors and transparency the overheads go in both directions thanks one morning in the year 1957 the neurosurgeon walter penfield saw himself like this a weird freak with huge hands huge mouth and a tiny bottom actually this creature is the result of the penfield research he named it homunculus basically the homunculus is the visualization of a human being where each part of the body is proportional to the surface it takes in the brain so of course homunculus is definitely not a freak it 's you it 's me it 's our invisible reality this visualization could explain for example why newborns or smokers put instinctively their fingers in the mouth unfortunately it does n't explain why so many designers remain mainly interested in designing chairs so anyway even if i do not understand science entirely for my design i essentially refer to it i 'm fascinated by its ability to deeply investigate the human being its way of working its way of feeling and it really helps me to understand how we see how we hear how we breathe how our brain can inform or mislead us it 's a great tool for me to understand what could be our real needs marketing people have never been able to do that marketing reduces things marketing simplifies marketing creates user groups and scientists amidst complexity amidst fluctuation and uniqueness what could be our real needs maybe the silence in our daily life we are continuously disturbed by aggressive sounds and you know all those kind of sound puts us in a kind of stressful state and prevent us from being quiet and focused so i wanted to create a kind of sound filter able to preserve ourselves from noise pollution but i did n't want it to make it by isolating people without any earmuffs or those kind of things or neither with including complex technology i just wanted to using the complexity and the technology of the brain of the human brain so i worked with white noise d.b is basically -- d.b is the name of the product basically a white noise diffuser this is white noise the white noise is the sum of all frequencies that are audible by the human being brought to the same intensity and this noise is like a " shhhhhhhhhhhhh " like that and this noise is the most neutral it is the perfect sound for our ears and our brain so when you hear this sound you feel like a kind of shelter preserved from noise pollution and when you hear the white noise your brain is immediately focused on it and do not be disturbed any more by the other aggressive sound it seems to be magic but it is just physiology it 's just in your brain and in mine i hope so in order to make this white noise a little bit active and reactive i create a ball a rolling ball able to analyze and find where does aggressive sound come from and roll at home or at work towards aggressive noise and emits white noise in order to neutralize it it works you feel the effect of the white noise it 's too in silence if you make some noise you can feel the effect so even if this object even if this product includes some technology it includes some speakers it includes some microphones and some electronic devices this object is not a very smart object and i do n't want to make a very smart object i do n't want to create a perfect object like a perfect robot i want to create an object like you and me so definitely not perfect so imagine for instance you are at home a loving dispute with your girl or boyfriend you shout you say " blah blah blah blah blah blah who is this guy " and d.b will probably roll toward you and turning around you is " shhhhhhhhhhhhh " like that definitely not perfect so you would probably shut it at this point anyway in this same kind of approach i designed k k is a daylight receiver transmitter so this object is supposed to be displayed on your desk or on your piano where you are supposed to spend most of your time in the day and this object will be able to know exactly the quantity of light you receive during the day and able to give you the quantity of light you need this object is completely covered by fiber opticals and the idea of those fiber opticals is to inform the object for sure but creates the idea of an eye sensibility of the object i want by this design feel when you see it you see instinctively this object seems to be very sensitive very reactive and this object knows better than you and probably before you what you really need you have to know that the lack of daylight can provoke some problem of energy or problem of libido so a huge problem most of the projects i work on -- i live in calibration with scientists i 'm just a designer so i need them so there can be some biologists psychiatrists mathematicians and so on and i submit them my intuitions my hypothesis my first ideas and they react they told me what is possible what is impossible and together we improve the original concept and we build the project to the end and this kind of relationship between designer and scientist started when i was at school early in my studies i was a guinea pig for a pharmaceutical industry and the irony for me was of course i did n't do that for the sake of science progress i just do that to make money anyway this project or this experience make me start a new project on the design of medicine you have to know that today roughly one or two every drug pills is not taken correctly so even if the active constituents in pharmaceuticals made constant progress in terms of chemistry target of stability the behavior of the patients goes more and more unstable so we took too many of them we took irregular dosage we do not follow instructions and so on so i wanted to create a new kind of medicine in order to create a new kind of relationship between the patient and the treatment so i turned traditional pills into this i 'm going to give you some example this one is an antibiotic and its purpose is to help patient to go to the end of the treatment and the concept is to create a kind of onion a kind of structure in layers so you start with the darkest one and you are helped to visualize the duration of the treatment and you are helped to visualize the decrease of the infection so the first day this is the big one and you have to peel and eat one layer a day and your antibiotic goes smaller and clearer and you 're waiting for recovery as you were waiting for the christmas day and you follow the treatment like that to the end of the treatment and here you can get the white core and it means right you are in the recovery thank you this one is a " third lung " a pharmaceutical device for long-term asthma treatment i designed to help kids to follow the treatment so the idea of this one is to create a relationship between the patient of the treatment but a relationship of dependency but in this case it is not the medication that is dependent on the patient this is the kids will feel the therapeutic object needs him so the idea is all night long the elastic skin of the third lung will slowly inflate itself including air and molecules for sure and when the kids wake up he can see the object needs him and he take him to his mouth and breathe the air it contains so by this way the kid to take care of himself is to take care of this living object and he does not feel anymore it 's relies on asthma treatment as the asthma treatment needs him in this guise of living object approach i like the idea of a kind of invisible design as if the function of the object exists in a kind of invisible field just around the objects themselves we could talk about a kind of soul of a ghost compelling them and almost a kind of poltergeist effect so when a passive object like this one seems to be alive because it is starting to move and i remember an exhibition design i made for john maeda and for the foundation cartier in paris and john maeda was supposed to show several graphic animations in this exhibition and my idea for this exhibition design was to create a real pong game like this one and the idea was to create some self-moving benches in the main exhibition room so the living benches would be exactly like the ball and john was so excited by this idea he said to me " okay let 's go " i remember the day of the opening i was a little bit late when i bring the 10 living and self-moving benches in the exhibition room john was just beside me and was like " hmm hmm " and he told me after a long silence " i wonder mathieu if people wo n't be more fascinated by your benches than by my videos " it would be a great honor a great compliment for me if he had n't decided to take all them off two hours before the opening so huge tragedy i guess you wo n't be surprised if i tell you that pinocchio is one of my great influences pinocchio is probably one of my best design products my favorite one because it is a kind of object with a conscience able to be modified by its surroundings and able to modify it as well the other great influence is the mine 's canary in coal mines this canary was supposed to be close to the miners and it was singing all day long and when it stops it means that it just died so this canary was a living alarm and a very efficient one a very natural technology in order to say to the miners " the air is too bad you have to go it 's an emergency " so it 's for me a great product and i tried to design a kind of canary andrea is one andrea is a living air filter that absorbs toxic gasses from air contaminated indoor air so it uses some plants to do this job selected for their gas-filtering ability you have to know or you probably already know that indoor air pollution is more toxic than outdoor one so while i 'm talking to you the seats you are sit on are currently emitting some invisible and odorless toxic gas sorry for that so you are currently breathing formaldehyde it 's the same for me with the carpet and this is exactly the same at home because all the product we get constantly give away the volatile component of which they 're made of so let 's have a look at your home so your sofa your plastic chair your kid 's toys give their own invisible reality and this one is very toxic this is the reason why i created with david edward a scientist of harvard university an object able to absorb the toxic elements using those kind of plants but the idea is to force the air to go in the effective part of the plants because the roots of the plant are not very effective bill wolverton from nasa analyzed it cleverly in the '70s so the idea is to create an object able to force the air and to be in contact at the right speed at the right place in all the effective parts of the plant so this is the final object it will be launched next september this one is kind of the same approach because i include in a product like andrea some plants and in this one plants are used for the water filtration ability and it includes some fishes as well but here unlike andrea here are supposed to be eaten indeed this object is a domestic farm for fishes and green so the idea of this object is to be able to get at home very local food the locavores used to get food taken in a radius of 100 miles local river is able to provide you food directly in your living room so the principle of this object is to create an ecosystem called aquaponics and the aquaponics is the dirty water of the fish by a water pump feeds the plants above and the plants will filter by the roots the dirty water of the fish after it goes back into the fish tank after that you have two options or you sit down in front of it like you would do in front your tv set amazing channel or you start fishing and you make some sushis with a fish and the aromatic plants above because you can grow some potatoes no not potatoes but tomatoes aromatic plants and so on so now we can breathe safely now we can eat local food now we can be treated by smart medicine now we can be well-balanced in our biorhythm with daylight but it was important to create a perfect place so i tried to in order to work and create so i designed for an american scientist based in paris a very stimulative brain-stimulative office i wanted to create a perfect place where you can work and play and where your body and your brain can work together so in this office you do not work anymore at your desk like a politician your seat your sleep and your play on a big geodesic island made of leather see like this one in this office you do not work and write and draw on a sheet of paper but you draw directly on a kind of huge whiteboard cave like a prehistoric scientist so you like that can make some sport during your work in this office you do not need to go out in order to be in contact with nature you include directly the nature in the floor of the office you can see it there this is an inspiration image to lead this project of the office it really helped me to design it i never show it to my client he would be so afraid just for my workshop i guess it may be the revenge of the guinea pig i was but it 's maybe the conviction as monkey and homunculus we are all of us need to be considered according to our real nature thank you very much i love theater i love the idea that you can transform become somebody else and look at life with a completely new perspective i love the idea that people will sit in one room for a couple of hours and listen the idea that in that room at that moment everyone regardless of their age their gender their race their color their religion comes together at that moment we transcend space and time together theater awakens our senses and opens the door to our imagination and our ability to imagine is what makes us explorers our ability to imagine makes us inventors and creators and unique i was commissioned in 2003 to create an original show and began developing " upwake " " upwake " tells the story of zero a modern-day business man going to work with his life in a suitcase stuck between dream and reality and not able to decipher the two i wanted " upwake " to have the same audiovisual qualities as a movie would and i wanted to let my imagination run wild so i began drawing the story that was moving in my head if antoine de saint-exupery the author of " the little prince " were here he would have drawn three holes inside that box and told you your sheep was inside because if you look closely enough things will begin to appear this is not a box ; these are the renderings of my imagination from head to paper to screen to life in " upwake " buildings wear suits zero tap dances on a giant keyboard clones himself with a scanner tames and whips the computer mice sails away into dreamscape from a single piece of paper and launches into space i wanted to create environments that moved and morphed like an illusionist go from one world to another in a second i wanted to have humor beauty simplicity and complexity and use metaphors to suggest ideas at the beginning of the show for example zero deejays dream and reality technology is an instrument that allowed me to manifest my visions in high definition live on stage so today i would like to talk to you about the relationship between theater and technology let 's start with technology all right let 's start with theater thank you " upwake " lasts 52 minutes and 54 seconds i project 3d animation on all the four surfaces of the stage which i interact with the use of animation and projection was a process of discovery i did n't use it as a special effect but as a partner on stage there are no special effects in " upwake " no artifice it 's as lavish and intricate as it is simple and minimal three hundred and forty-four frames four and a half years and commissions later what started as a one person show became a collaborative work of nineteen most talented artists and here are some excerpts thank you so this is relatively a new show that we 're now beginning to tour and in austin texas i was asked to give small demonstrations in schools during the afternoon when i arrived at one of the schools i certainly did not expect this : six hundred kids packed in a gymnasium waiting i was a little nervous performing without animation costume -- really -- and make-up but the teachers came to me afterward and told me they had n't seen the kids that attentive and i think the reason why is that i was able to use their language and their reality in order to transport them into another something happened along the way zero became a person and not just a character in a play zero does not speak is neither man nor woman zero is zero a little hero of the 21st century and zero can touch so many more people than i possibly could it 's as much about bringing new disciplines inside this box as it is about taking theater out of its box as a street performer i have learned that everybody wants to connect and that usually if you 're a bit extraordinary if you 're not exactly of human appearance then people will feel inclined to participate and to feel out loud it 's as though you made something resonate within them it 's as though the mystery of the person they 're interacting with and connecting allows them to be themselves just a bit more because through your mask they let theirs go being human is an art form i know theater can improve the quality of people 's lives and i know theater can heal i 've worked as a doctor clown in a hospital for two years i have seen sick kids and sad parents and doctors be lifted and transported in moments of pure joy i know theater unites us zero wants to engage the generation of today and tomorrow tell various stories through different mediums comic books quantum physics video games and zero wants to go to the moon in 2007 zero launched a green campaign suggesting his friends and fans to turn off their electricity every sunday from 7:53 to 8:00 p.m the idea is simple basic it 's not original but it 's important and it 's important to participate there is a revolution it 's a human and technological revolution it 's motion and emotion it 's information it 's visual it 's musical it 's sensorial it 's conceptual it 's universal it 's beyond words and numbers it 's happening the natural progression of science and art finding each other to better touch and define the human experience there is a revolution in the way that we think in the way that we share and the way that we express our stories our evolution this is a time of communication connection and creative collaboration charlie chaplin innovated motion pictures and told stories through music silence humor and poetry he was social and his character the tramp spoke to millions he gave entertainment pleasure and relief to so many human beings when they needed it the most we are not here to question the possible ; we are here to challenge the impossible in the science of today we become artists in the art of today we become scientists we design our world we invent possibilities we teach touch and move it is now that we can use the diversity of our talents to create intelligent meaningful and extraordinary work it 's now thank you i do n't know your name audience member : howard howard thom mayne : howard i 'm sitting next to howard i do n't know howard obviously and he 's going i hope you 're not next amazing amazing performance i kind of erased everything in my brain to follow that let me start some place i 'm interested -- i kind of do the same thing but i do n't move my body and instead of using human figures to develop ideas of time and space i work in the mineral world i work with more or less inert matter and i organize it and well it 's also a bit different because an architect versus let 's say a dance company finally is a negotiation between one 's private world one 's conceptual world the world of ideas the world of aspirations of inventions with the relationship of the exterior world and all the limitations the naysayers because i have to say for my whole career if there 's anything that 's been consistent it 's been that you ca n't do it no matter what i 've done what i 've tried to do everybody says it ca n't be done and it 's continuous across the complete spectrum of the various kind of realities that you confront with your ideas and to be an architect somehow you have to negotiate between left and right and you have to negotiate between this very private place where ideas take place and the outside world and then make it understood i can start any number of places because this process is also -- i think -- very different from some of the morning sessions which you had such a kind of very clear such a lineal idea like the last one say with howard that i think the creative process in architecture the design process is extremely circuitous it 's labyrinthine it 's calvino 's idea of the quickest way between two points is the circuitous line not the straight line and definitely my life has been part of that i 'm going to start with some simple kind of notions of how we organize things but basically what we do is we try to give coherence to the world we make physical things buildings that become a part in an accretional process ; they make cities and those things are the reflection of the processes and the time that they are made and what i 'm doing is attempting to synthesize the way one sees the world and the territories which are useful as generative material because really all i 'm interested in always as an architect is the way things are produced because that 's what i do right and it 's not based on an a priori notion i have no interest at all in conceiving something in my brain and saying " this is what it looks like " in fact somebody mentioned -- ewan maybe it was you in your introduction -- about this is what architects -- did somebody say it 's what business people come to it 's what the corporate world comes to when they want to make it look like something at the end of the line huh wow it does n't work that way for me at all i have no interest in that whatsoever architecture is the beginning of something because it 's -- if you 're not involved in first principles if you 're not involved in the absolute the beginning of that generative process it 's cake decoration and i 've nothing wrong with cake decoration and cake decorators if anybody 's involved in cake decorations -- it 's not what i 'm interested in doing and so in the formation of things in giving it form in concretizing these things it starts with some notion of how one organizes and i 've had for 30 years an interest in a series of complexities where a series of forces are brought to bear and to understand the nature of the final result of that representing the building itself there 's been a continual relationship between inventions which are private and reality which has been important to me a project which is part of an exhibition in copenhagen 10 years ago which was the modeling of a hippocampus -- the territory of the brain that records short-term memory -- and the documentation of that the imaginative and documentation of that through a series of drawings which literally attempt to organize that experience and it had to do with the notion of walking a kilometer observing every kilometer a particular object of desire and then placing that within this and the notion was that i could make an organization not built on normal coherencies but built on non-sequiturs built on randomness and i 'd been extremely interested in this notion of randomness as it produces architectural work and as it definitely connects to the notion of the city an accretional notion of the city and that led to various ideas of organization and then this led to broader ideas of buildings that come together through the multiplicity of systems and it 's not any single system that makes the work it 's the relationship -- it 's the dynamics between the systems -- which have the power to transform and invent and produce an architecture that is -- that would otherwise not exist and those systems could be identified and of course today with the technology of the computer and with the rapid prototyping etc. we have the mechanisms to understand and to respond to these systems and to allow them to adjust to the various accommodations of functionalities because that 's all we do we 're producing spaces that accommodate human activity and what i 'm interested in is not the styling of that but the relationship of that as it enhances that activity and that directly connects to ideas of city-making this is a project that we just finished in penang for a very very large city project that came directly out of this process which is the result of the multiplicity of forces that produce it and the project -- again enormous enormous competition -- on the hudson river and in new york that we were asked to do three years ago which uses these processes and what you 're looking at are possibilities that have to do with the generation of the city as one applies a methodology that uses notions of these multiple forces that deals with the enormity of the problem the complexity of the problem when we 're designing cities at larger and larger aggregates because one of the issues today is that the economic aggregate is driving the development aggregate and as the aggregates get larger we require more and more complex investigation processes to solve these problems and that led us directly to the olympic village i was in new york on monday presenting it to the ioc we won the competition -- what was it nine months ago again a direct reflection from using these processes to develop extremely complicated very large-scale organisms and then also was working with broad strategies in this case we only used 15 of the 60 acres of land and the 45 acres was a park and would become the legacy of the olympic village and it would become the second largest park in the boroughs etc its position of course in the middle of manhattan -- it 's on hunter 's point and then the broader ideas of city-making start having direct influences on architecture on the elements that make up the broader scheme the buildings themselves and start guiding us architecture for me has been an investigation of a multiplicity of forces that could come from literally any place and so i can start this discussion in any number of places and i 've chosen three or four to talk about and it has also to do with an interest in the vast kind of territory that architecture touches it literally is connected to anything in terms of knowledge base there 's just no place that it does n't somehow have a connective tissue to this is jim dine and it 's the absence of presence etc it 's the clothing the skin without the presence of the character it became kind of an idea for the notion of the surface of a work and it was used in a project where we could unravel that surface and it was a figurative idea that was going to be folded and made into a very kind of complex space and the idea was the relationship of the space which was made up of the fold of the image and the dialectic or the conflict between the figuration and the clarity of the image and the complexity of the space which were in dialog and it made us rethink the whole notion of how we work and how we make things and it led us to ideas that were closer to fashion design as we flattened out surfaces and then brought them back together as they could make spatial combinations and this was the first prototype in korea as we 're dealing with a dynamic envelope and then the same characteristic of the fabric it has a material identity and it 's translucent and it 's porous and it allows us for a very different notion of what a skin of a building is and that turned right away into another project this is the caltrans building in los angeles and now we 're seeing as the skin and the body is differentiated again it 's a very very simple notion if you look at most buildings what you look at is the building the facade and it is the building and all of a sudden we 're kind of moving away and we 're separating the skin from the body and that 's going to lead to broader performance criteria which i 'm going to talk about in a minute and you 're looking at how it drapes over and differentiates from the body and then again the building itself middle of los angeles right across from city hall and as it moves it takes pieces of the earth with it it bends up it 's part of a sign system which was part of the kind of legacy of los angeles -- the two-dimension three-dimension signing etc and then it allows one to penetrate the work itself it 's transparent and it allows you to understand i think what is always the most interesting thing in any building which is the actual constructional processes that make it and it 's probably the most intense kind of territory of the work which is not occupied because architecture is always the most interesting in some mechanism when it 's separated from function and this is an area that allows for that and then the skin starts transforming into other materials we 're using light as a building material in this case we 're working with keith sonnier in new york and we 're making this large outside room which is possible in los angeles and which is very much reflective of the urban the contemporary urban environments that you would find in shibuya or you 'd find in mexico city or sao paulo etc. that have to do with activating the city over a longer span of time and that was very much part of the notion of the urban objective of this project in los angeles and again all of it promoting transparency and an image which may be closest talks about the use of light as a medium that light becomes literally a building material well that immediately turned into something much broader and as a scope and again we 're looking at an early sketch where i 'm understanding now that the skin can be a transition between the ground and the tower this is a building in san francisco which is under construction and now it turned into something much much broader as a problem and it has to do with performance this will be the first building in the united states that took -- well i ca n't say it took the air conditioning out it 's a hybrid i wanted a pure thing and i ca n't get it it 's a wrong attitude actually because the hybrid is probably more interesting but we took the air conditioning out of the tower there 's some air conditioning left in the base but the skin now moves on hydraulics it forces air through a venturi force if there 's no wind it adjusts continually and we removed the air conditioning huge huge thing half a million dollars a year delta 10 of these -- it 's just under a million square feet -- 800 and some thousand square feet -- 10 of these would power sausalito -- the delta on this and so now what we 're looking at as the projects get larger in scale as they interface with broader problems that they expand the capabilities in terms of their performance well i could also start here we could talk about the relationship at a more biological sense of the relationship of building and ground well our research -- my generation for sure people who were going to school in the late '60s -- made very much a shift out of the internal focus of architecture looking at architecture within its own territory and we were much more affected by film by what was going on in the art world etc this is of course michael heizer and when i saw this first an image and then visited it completely changed the way i thought after that point and i understood that building really could be the augmentation of the earth 's surface and it completely shifted the notion of building ground in the most basic sense and then -- well he was probably looking at this -- this is nazca ; this is 700 years ago -- the most amazing four-kilometer land sculptures they 're just totally incredible and that led us to then completely rethinking how we draw how we work this is the first sketch of a high school in pomona -- well whatever it is a model a conceptual kind of idea and it 's the reshaping of the earth to make it occupiable so it puts 200,000 square feet of stuff that make a high school work in the surface of that earth there it is modeled as it was developing into a piece of work and there it is again as it 's starting to get resolved tectonically and then there 's the school and of course we 're interested in participating with education i have absolutely no interest in producing a building that just accommodates x y and z function what i 'm interested in are how these ideas participate in the educational process of young people it demands some sort of notion of inquiry because it 's a system that 's developed not sculpturally it 's an idea that started from my first discussion it has to do with a broad consistent logic and that logic could be understood as one occupies the building and there 's an overt -- at least there 's an attempt to make a very overt notion of a building that connects to the land in a very different way because i was interested in a very didactic approach to the problem as one would understand that and the second project that was just finished in los angeles that uses some of the same ideas it uses landscape as a major idea then again we 're doing the headquarters for noaa -- national oceanographic and atmospheric agency -- outside of washington in maryland and this is how they see the world they have 22 satellites zipping around at plus or minus 100 miles and the site 's in red and what we really want to do -- well the architects if there are architects out there this is the laugier hut ; this is the primitive hut that 's been around for so long -- and what we wanted to do is really build this because they see themselves as the caretakers of the world and we wanted them to look down at their satellite how they see their own site that eight-acre site and we wanted nothing left we wanted it to stay green there 's actually three baseball fields on it right now and they 're going to stay there we put one piece directly north-south and it holds the dishes at the ears right and then right below that the processing and the mission lift and the mission control room and all the other spaces are underground and what you look at is an aircraft carrier that 's performance-driven by the cone vision of these satellite dishes and that the building itself is occupied in the lower portion broken up by a series of courts and it 's five acres of uninterrupted horizontal space for their administrative offices and then that in turn propelled us to look at larger-scale projects where this notion of landscape building interface becomes a connective tissue the new capital competition for berlin four years ago and again we just finished the ecb -- actually coop himmelblau in vienna just won this project where the building was separated into a series of landscape elements that became part of a connective tissue of a park which is parallel to the river and develops ideas of the buildings themselves and becomes part of the connective fabric -- the social cultural and the landscape recreational fabric of the city and the building is no longer seen as an autonomous thing but something that 's only inextricably connected to this city and this place at this time and a project that was realized in austria the hooper bank which again used this idea of connecting typology the traditional buildings and morphology or the relationship of the development of land as an idea into a complex which is a piece of a city where we can see part of it is literally just this augmenting this movement of the land that 's a very simple idea of just lifting it up and occupying it and other parts are much more energetic and intense and talk about that intensity in terms of the collisions of the kind of events they make that have to do with putting a series of systems together and then where part of it is in the ground part of it is oppositional lifts one enters the building as it lifts off the ground and it becomes part of the idea and then the skin -- the edges of this -- all promote the dynamic the movement of the building as a series of seismic shifts geologic shifts right and it makes for event space and then it breaks in places that allow you to peer into the interior and those interiors again are promoting transparency for the workplace which has been a continual interest of ours and then again in a more kind of traditional setting this is a graduate student housing in toronto and it 's very much about the relationship of a building as it makes a connective tissue to the city the main idea was the gateway where it breaks the site and the building occupies both the public space and the private space and it 's that territory of -- it 's this thing i visited the site many times and everybody kind of -- you can see this from two kilometers away ; it 's an exact center of the street and the whole notion is to engage the public to engage buildings as part of the public tissue of the city and finally one of the most interesting projects -- it 's a courthouse and what i want to talk about -- this is the supreme court of course -- and well i 'm dealing with michael hogan the chief justice of oregon you could not proceed without making this negotiation between one 's own values and the relationship of the character you 're working with and how he understands the court because i 'm showing him of course corbusier at savoy which is 1928 which is the beginning of modern architecture well then we get to this image and this is where the project started because i 'm going i 'm interested in the phenomenon that 's taking place in here and really what we 're talking about is constructing reality and i 'm a character that 's extremely interested in understanding the nature of that constructed reality because there 's no such thing as nature any more nature is gone nature in the 19th-century sense alright nature is only a cultural edifice today right we construct it and we construct those ideas and then of course this one our governor at the moment and we spent some time with conan believe it or not and then that led us to kind of the very differences of our worlds from a legal and an artistic architectural and it forced us to talk about notions of how we work and the dynamics of that and what other sources of the work is and it led us to the project the courthouse which is absolutely a part of a negotiation between tradition and pieces of the traditional courthouse you 'll find a stair that 's the same length as the supreme court here 's a piano nobile which is a device used in the renaissance the courts were made of that the skin is this series of layers that reflect even rusticated stonework but which were embedded with fragments of the constitution which were part of the little process all set on a plinth that defined it from the community thank you so much ninety-nine percent of us have the dream of listeners not being the musicians -- the listeners right and we crave one thing even though we kind of do n't know it all the time we crave to be in the room with the musician the day it was recorded the day it was played and we go to live concerts and we get that as much as we can but then we listen to the other 99 percent of our stuff recorded and it turns out the further back you go in history the little rougher it sounds and so we said there 's a solution to this let 's separate the performance as a thing out from the recording which was how it was made you know the thing with microphones in the room and all that day but the performance itself was how the musicians worked their fingers and what instruments they were using and it 's the data hidden inside the recording in order to do this it 's a lot of hardware and software that runs in a very high resolution and yamaha makes an incredible thing called the disklavier pro that looks like a nice grand piano there and you probably did n't realize it 's going to do all these things -- but full of solenoids and fiber optics and computers and all this kind of stuff the highest resolution out of japan and this just did n't work until we could cross this line that says high-definition and we were able to cross this line called the uncanny valley in terms of -- artificial intelligence terms we have a process where we you know kind of put it into the computer and digitize it and then a whole lot of analysis and we look at every single note and all the attributes of those notes : how hard they were struck and how they were held down and how you move the fingers so we had to develop a whole new science of how you move your fingers and you know it 's a thing your piano teacher teaches you but we never had a science behind these kinds of things i 'm going to start with glenn gould he died 25 years ago this year and was born 75 years ago this year was a beloved pianist maybe the great cult pianist of the twentieth century he just got tired of being in front of an audience and felt like -- a performing monkey was in fact his term so he stepped back and did nothing but the crafting of his work and gould 's specialty was playing bach his maybe most famous recording was something called " the goldberg variations " bach only wrote themes and variations one time he wrote some early pieces but late in his life in his mature period he said " here 's a theme -- 30 variations " in fact the theme is n't even the melody it 's the bass line and gould recorded it in two major recordings that you may know about one in mono and one in stereo and the one in mono by the way he used the pedal and as he got older he said " no no wait a minute i 'm going to get very scientific about this and not use the pedal " what i 'd like you to hear live is the 1955 version and we 'll play the first couple pieces of it glenn gould 1955 how about that so let me tell you a little bit how this was done first of all let me get you to the end step this is -- we have a fairly complex process that you know software and musicians and so on but when we 're all done we know that the ear is the final arbiter we can play the original in one ear and a new recording in the other so i 'm going to do this for you right now what you just heard and in the right speaker is going to be the original recording and the left speaker is going to be the new recording actually of an instrument just like that one and i 'm going to play them together at the same time that 's the original [ unclear ] that 's the two together before " jurassic park " there was no science for how skin hung off of muscle right so in the video world we 've been able to invent in our lifetimes natural behavior and this is kind of another example of putting a science behind natural behavior and then you heard the original ultimately i started with the experience and the experience is : i want to be in the room and hear the musicians lots of you can afford to buy one of these but if not there is now high-definition surround sound and i got to tell you if you have n't heard high-definition surround go down to your audio dealer your audiophile dealer it 's so involving compared to regular stereo but if you do n't have that maybe you can listen on your headphones and so on the same disk we have five recordings -- sony has five recordings and you could listen in headphones with this thing called binaural recording and it 's a dummy head that sits in front of the instrument and it 's got microphones where the ears are and when you put on headphones and you listen to this you 're inside of glenn gould 's body and it is a chuckle until you know the musicians who are musicians who play the piano listen to this say " i ca n't believe it ! it 's just what it 's like to play the piano " except now you 're inside glenn gould 's body playing the piano and it feels like your fingers are making the decisions and moving through the whole process it 's a game changer here 's now something we know in spectacular quality the whole process is very sensitive to temperature and humidity what you heard today was not perfect it 's an amalgam of wood and cast iron and felt and steel strings and all these and they 're all amazingly sensitive to temperature and humidity so when you go into the recording session you get to stop after every piece and rebuild the piano if you need to there 's the whole action there sitting kind of on the side and the dummy head and our recording engineers standing around while we rebuild the piano without putting dates next to these things step-by-step music will be turned into data like every field that 's occurred in the past 35 or 40 years audio has come very late to this game -- i 'm not talking about digitizing and bits and re-mastering i 'm talking about turn it into the data that it was made from which is how it was performed and audio came very late because our ears are so hard to fool -- they 're high-resolution and they 're wired straight to our emotions and you ca n't trick them very easily your eyes are pretty happy with some color and movement you know all right there 's this episode of " star trek " i get it -- it was all just laid in for me yesterday there the episode of " star trek " for me was james daly played methuselah -- remember this one and at some point he 's dancing with his -- and i wo n't ruin the episode for you from 1967 right do you know where i 'm going and nimoy i 'm sorry spock sits down at the piano and he starts playing this brahms waltz and they all dance to it and then spock turns round he goes " james i know all of the brahms waltzes and i do n't believe this is one of them in the category " that 's where i 'm at i want to hear the waltzes brahms did n't write i want to hear the pieces that horowitz did n't play but i believe we 're on a path now when we get to data that we can distill styles and templates and formulas and all these kinds of things again that you 've seen happen in the computer graphics world it 's now coming in this world the transition will be this one it says right now we think music is notes and how they 're played and i believe this is coming because what you 've just heard was a computer playing data -- no glenn gould in the room but yet it was human and i believe you 'll get to the next step the real dream of listeners every time you listen to a recording today every time you take out your ipod and whatever every time you listen to it it 's the same thing -- it 's frozen would n't it be cool if every time you listened it could be different this morning you 're sadder you want to hear your song the same song played sadder than you did yesterday you want to hear it played by different musicians you want to hear it in different rooms and whatever we 've seen all these " star treks " and they 're all holodeck episodes as well every time i listen to that i get goose bumps it 's so amazing it 's so exciting every time i listen to that recording it 's like " oh my god i ca n't believe i 'm in the same room i ca n't believe this is happening " it 's a way better experience than whatever you 're used to listening to in whatever form and lastly i will wrap up with one minute of art tatum so i 've really overshot my budget here we made a new recording of him playing in the shrine auditorium in september it was a concert he recorded in the shrine auditorium in 1949 and i 've got to tell you we have this lab where we build and measure everything back in raleigh north carolina and we flew out to los angeles and as the president of the company i did n't feel real comfortable about where we were that 's a real uncomfortable feeling when all the equipment 's come out and a whole sony team and people are going to be sitting there in the audience and we put the piano on the sweet spot of the stage in the shrine which has not changed since 1949 still seats 6,000 people and on the sweet spot on the stage tatum starts playing â€¦ and every note every beat every slur every accent every pedal was perfect because he played it for that room on that day and we captured all that data all over again and i want you to hear that right now and fortunately it 's right in here this is an encore he used to do it 's one minute long it 's an irish jig and i want you to hear his humor and that 's just what the live audience did so thank you very much michael thank you for the opportunity i am known best for human-powered flight but that was just one thing that got me going in the sort of things that i 'm working in now as a youngster i was very interested in model airplanes ornithopters autogyros helicopters gliders power planes indoor models outdoor models everything which i just thought was a lot of fun and wondered why most other people did n't share my same enthusiasm with them and then navy pilot training and after college i got into sailplane flying power plane flying and considered the sailplanes as a sort of hobby and fun but got tangled up with some great professor types who convinced me and everybody else in the field that this was a good way to get into really deep science while this was all going on i was in the field of weather modification although getting a ph.d. in aeronautics the weather modification subject was getting started and as a graduate student i could go around to the various talks that were being given on a hitchhiker ride to the east coast and so on and everybody would talk to me but all the professionals in the field hated each other and they would n't communicate and as a result i got the absolutely unique background in that field and started a company which did more research in weather modification than anybody and there are a lot of things that i just ca n't go into but then 1971 started aerovironment with no employees -- then one or two three and sort of fumbled along on trying to get interesting projects we had airdynamisis who like i did not want to work for aerospace companies on some big many year project and so we did our small projects and the company slowly grew the thing that is exciting was in 1976 i suddenly got interested in the human-powered airplane because i 'd made a made a loan to a friend of 100,000 dollars or i guaranteed the money at the bank he needed them -- he needed the money for starting a company the company did not succeed and he could n't pay the money back and i was the guarantor of the note so i had a $ 100,000 debt and i noticed that the kramer prize for human-powered flight which had then been around for -- -- 17 years at the time was 50,000 pounds which at the exchange rate was just about 100,000 dollars so suddenly i was interested in human-powered flight -- -- and did not -- the way i approached it first thinking about ways to make the planes was just like they 'd been doing in england and not succeeding and i gave it up i figured nah there is n't any simple easy way but then got off on a vacation trip and was studying bird flight just for the fun of it and you can watch a bird soaring around in circles and measure the time and estimate the bank angle and immediately figure out its speed and the turning radius and so on which i could do in the car as we 're driving along on a vacation trip -- -- with my three sons young sons helping me but ridiculing the whole thing very much but that began thinking about how birds went around and then how airplanes would how hang gliders would fly and then other planes and the idea of the gossamer-condor-type airplane quickly emerged was so logical one should have thought of it in the first place but one did n't and it was just keep the weight down -- 70 pounds was all it weighed -- but let the size swell up like a hang glider but three times the span three times the cord you 're down to a third of the speed a third of the power and a good bicyclist can put out that power and that worked and we won the prize a year later we did n't -- a lot of flying a lot of experiments a lot of things that did n't work and ones that did work and the plane kept getting a little better a little better got a good pilot brian allen to operate it and finally succeeded but unfortunately about 65,000 dollars was spent on the project and there was only about 30 to help retire the debt but fortunately henry kramer who put up the prize for -- that was a one-mile flight -- put up a new prize for flying the english channel 21 miles and he thought it would take another 18 years for somebody to win that we realized that if you just cleaned up our gossamer condor a little bit the power to fly would be decreased a little bit and if you decrease the power required a little the pilot can fly a much longer period of time and brian allen was able in a miraculous flight to get the gossamer albatross across the english channel and we won the 100,000-pound 200,000-dollar prize for that and when all expenses were paid the debt was handled and everything was fine it turned out that giving the planes to the museum was worth much more than the debt so for five years six years i only had to pay one third income tax so there were good economic reasons for the project but -- -- that 's not well the project was done entirely for economic reasons and we have not been involved in any human-powered flight since then -- -- because the prizes are all over but that sure started me thinking about various things and immediately we began making a solar-powered plane because we felt solar power was going to be so important for the country and the world we did n't want the small funding in the government to be decreased which is what the government was trying to do with it and we thought a solar-powered plane would n't really make sense but you could do it and it would get a lot of publicity for solar power and maybe help that field and that project continued did succeed and we then got into other projects in aviation and mechanical things and ground devices but while this was going on in 1982 i got a prize from the lindbergh foundation -- their annual prize -- and i had to prepare a paper on it which collected all my varied thoughts and varied interests over the years this was the one chance that i had to focus on what i really was after and what was important and to my surprise i realized the importance of environmental issues which charles lindbergh devoted the last third of his life to and preparing that paper did me a lot of good i thought back about if i was a space traveler and came and visited earth every 5,000 years and for a few thousand visits i would see the same thing every time the little differences in the earth but this last time just coming round right now suddenly there 'd be huge changes in the environment in the concentration of people and it was just unbelievable the amount of -- all the change in it i wanted to -- well one of the biggest changes is 200 years ago we began using coal from underground which has a lot of pollution and 100 years ago began getting gasoline from underground with a lot of pollution and gasoline consumption or production will reach its limit in about ten years and then go down and we wonder what 's going to happen with transportation i wanted to show the slide -- this slide i think is the most important one any of you will see ever because -- -- it shows nature versus humans and goes from 1850 to 2050 and so the year 2000 you see there and this is the weight of all air and land vertebrates humans and muskrats and giraffes and birds and so on are -- the red line goes up that 's the humans and livestock and pets portion the green line goes down that 's the wild nature portion humans livestock and pets are now 98 percent of the total world 's mass of vertebrates on land and air and you do n't know what the future will hold but it 's not going to get a lower percentage ten thousand years ago the humans and livestock and pets were not even one tenth of one percent and would n't even have been visible on such a curve now they are 98 percent and it i think shows human domination of the earth i give a talk to some remarkable high school students each summer and ask them after they 've asked me questions and i give them a talk and so on then i ask them questions what 's the population of the earth what 's the population of the earth going to be when you 're the age of your parents which i 'd never really -- they had never really thought about but now they think about it and then what population of the earth would be an equilibrium that could continue on and be for 2050 2100 2150 and they form little groups all fighting with each other and when i leave two hours later most of them are saying about 2 billion people and they do n't have any clue about how to get down to 2 billion nor do i but i think they 're right and this is a serious problem rachel carson was thinking of these and came out with " silent spring " way back " solar manifesto " by hermann scheer in germany claims all energy on earth can be derived for every country from solar energy and water and so on you do n't need to dig down for these chemicals and we can do things much more efficiently let 's have the next slide so this just summarizes it " over billions of years on a unique sphere chance has painted a thin covering of life -- complex and probable wonderful and fragile suddenly we humans a recently arrived species no longer subject to the checks and balances inherent in nature have grown in population technology and intelligence to a position of terrible power we now wield the paintbrush " we 're in charge it 's frightening and i do a painting every 20 or 25 years this is the last one and [ it ] shows the earth in a time flag : on the right in trilobites and dinosaurs and so on ; and over the triangle we now get to civilization and tv and traffic jams and so on i have no idea of what comes next so i just used robotic and natural cockroaches as the future as a little warning and two weeks after this drawing was done we actually had our first project contract at aerovironment on robotic cockroaches which was very frightening to me well that 'll be all the slides as time went on we stopped our environmental programs we focused more on the really serious energy problems of the future and we produced products for the company and we developed the impact car that general motors made the ev1 out of -- and got the air resources board to have the regulations that stimulated the electric cars but they 've since come apart and we 've done a lot of things small drone airplanes and so on i have a helios we have the first video narrator : with a wingspan of 247 feet this makes her larger than a boeing 747 her designers ' attention to detail and her construction gives helios ' structure the flexibility and strength to deal with the turbulence encountered in the atmosphere this enables her to easily ride through the air currents as if she 's sliding along on the ocean waves paul maccready : the wings could touch together on top and not break we think narrator : and helios now begins the process of turning her back to the sun to maximize the power from her solar array as the sky gets darker and the outside air temperatures drop below minus 100 degrees fahrenheit the most environmentally hostile segment of helios 's journey has gone by without notice except for being recorded by specially designed data acquisition systems and their associated sensors approaching a peak radar altitude of 96,863 feet at 4:12 p.m. helios is standing on top of 98 percent of the earth 's atmosphere this is more than 10,000 feet higher than the previous world 's altitude record held by the sr-71 blackbird pm : that plane has many purposes but it 's aimed for communications and it can fly so slowly that it 'll just stay up at 65,000 feet eventually it will be able to have to stay up day night day night for six months at a time acting like the synchronous satellite but only ten miles above the earth let 's have the next video this shows the other end of the spectrum narrator : a tiny airplane the av pointer serves for surveillance in effect a pair of roving eyeglasses a cutting-edge example of where miniaturization can lead if the operator is remote from the vehicle it is convenient to carry assemble and launch by hand battery-powered it is silent and rarely noticed it sends high-resolution video pictures back to the operator with on-board gps it can navigate autonomously and it is rugged enough to self-land without damage pm : okay and let 's have the next that plane is widely used by the military now in all their operations let 's have the next video alan alda : he 's got it he 's got it he 's got it on his head we 're going to end our visit with paul maccready 's flying circus by meeting his son tyler who with his two brothers helped build the gossamer condor 25 years ago tyler maccready : you can chase it like this for hours aa : when they got bored with their father 's project they invented an extraordinary little plane of their own tm : and i can control it by putting the lift on one side of the wing or on the other aa : they called it their walkalong glider i 've never seen anything like that how old were you when you invented that tm : oh 10 11 tm : 12 something like that pm : and tyler 's here to show you the walkalong tm : all right you all got a couple of these in your gift bags and one of the first things the production version seemed to dive a little bit and so i would just suggest you bend the wing tips up a little bit before you try flying it i 'll give you a demonstration of how it works the idea is that it soars on the lift over your body like a seagull soaring on a cliff as the wind comes up it has to go over the cliff so as you walk through the air it goes around your body some has to go over you and so you just keep the glider positioned in that up current the launch is the difficult part : you 've got to hold it high up over your head and you start walking forward and just let go of it and you can control it like that and then also like it said in the video you can turn it left or right just by putting the lift under one wing or another so i can do it -- oops that was going to be a right turn okay this one will be a left turn here but -- -- anyway and that 's it so you can just control it wherever you want and it 's just hours of fun and these are no longer in production so you have real collector 's items and this we just wanted to show you -- if we can get the video running on this yeah -- just an example of a little video surveillance this was flying around in the party last night and -- -- you can see how it just can fly around and you can spy on anybody you want and that 's it i was going to bring an airplane but i was worried about hitting people in here so i thought this would be a little bit more gentle and that 's it yeah just a few inventions all right i 'm here today representing a team of artists and technologists and filmmakers that worked together on a remarkable film project for the last four years and along the way they created a breakthrough in computer visualization so i want to show you a clip of the film now hopefully it wo n't stutter and if we did our jobs well you wo n't know that we were even involved voice : i do n't know how it 's possible â€¦ but you seem to have more hair brad pitt : what if i told you that i was n't getting older â€¦ but i was getting younger than everybody else i was born with some form of disease voice : what kind of disease bp : i was born old man : i 'm sorry bp : no need to be there 's nothing wrong with old age girl : are you sick bp : i heard momma and tizzy whisper and they said i was gon na die soon but â€¦ maybe not girl : you 're different than anybody i 've ever met bb : there were many changes â€¦ some you could see some you could n't hair started growing in all sorts of places along with other things i felt pretty good considering ed ulbrich : that was a clip from " the curious case of benjamin button " many of you maybe you 've seen it or you 've heard of the story but what you might not know is that for nearly the first hour of the film the main character benjamin button who 's played by brad pitt is completely computer-generated from the neck up now there 's no use of prosthetic makeup or photography of brad superimposed over another actor 's body we 've created a completely digital human head so i 'd like to start with a little bit of history on the project this is based on an f. scott fitzgerald short story it 's about a man who 's born old and lives his life in reverse now this movie has floated around hollywood for well over half a century and we first got involved with the project in the early '90s with ron howard as the director we took a lot of meetings and we seriously considered it but at the time we had to throw in the towel it was deemed impossible it was beyond the technology of the day to depict a man aging backwards the human form in particular the human head has been considered the holy grail of our industry the project came back to us about a decade later and this time with a director named david fincher now fincher is an interesting guy david is fearless of technology and he is absolutely tenacious and david wo n't take " no " and david believed like we do in the visual effects industry that anything is possible as long as you have enough time resources and of course money and so david had an interesting take on the film and he threw a challenge at us he wanted the main character of the film to be played from the cradle to the grave by one actor it happened to be this guy we went through a process of elimination and a process of discovery with david and we ruled out of course swapping actors that was one idea : that we would have different actors and we would hand off from actor to actor we even ruled out the idea of using makeup we realized that prosthetic makeup just would n't hold up particularly in close-up and makeup is an additive process you have to build the face up and david wanted to carve deeply into brad 's face to bring the aging to this character he needed to be a very sympathetic character so we decided to cast a series of little people that would play the different bodies of benjamin at the different increments of his life and that we would in fact create a computer-generated version of brad 's head aged to appear as benjamin and attach that to the body of the real actor sounded great of course this was the holy grail of our industry and the fact that this guy is a global icon did n't help either because i 'm sure if any of you ever stand in line at the grocery store you know -- we see his face constantly so there really was no tolerable margin of error there were two studios involved : warner brothers and paramount and they both believed this would make an amazing film of course but it was a very high-risk proposition there was lots of money and reputations at stake but we believed that we had a very solid methodology that might work â€¦ but despite our verbal assurances they wanted some proof and so in 2004 they commissioned us to do a screen test of benjamin and we did it in about five weeks but we used lots of cheats and shortcuts we basically put something together to get through the meeting i 'll roll that for you now this was the first test for benjamin button and in here you can see that 's a computer-generated head -- pretty good -- attached to the body of an actor and it worked and it gave the studio great relief after many years of starts and stops on this project and making that tough decision they finally decided to greenlight the movie and i can remember actually when i got the phone call to congratulate us to say the movie was a go i actually threw up you know this is some tough stuff so we started to have early team meetings and we got everybody together and it was really more like therapy in the beginning convincing each other and reassuring each other that we could actually undertake this we had to hold up an hour of a movie with a character and it 's not a special effects film ; it has to be a man we really felt like we were in a -- kind of a 12-step program and of course the first step is : admit you 've got a problem so we had a big problem : we did n't know how we were going to do this but we did know one thing being from the visual effects industry we with david believed that we now had enough time enough resources and god we hoped we had enough money and we had enough passion to will the processes and technology into existence so when you 're faced with something like that of course you 've got to break it down you take the big problem and you break it down into smaller pieces and you start to attack that so we had three main areas that we had to focus on we needed to make brad look a lot older -- needed to age him 45 years or so and we also needed to make sure that we could take brad 's idiosyncrasies his little tics the little subtleties that make him who he is and have that translate through our process so that it appears in benjamin on the screen and we also needed to create a character that could hold up under really all conditions he needed to be able to walk in broad daylight at nighttime under candlelight he had to hold an extreme close-up he had to deliver dialogue he had to be able to take a bath to cry he even had to throw up not all at the same time -- but he had to you know do all of those things and the work had to hold up for almost the first hour of the movie we did about 325 shots so we needed a system that would allow benjamin to do everything a human being can do and we realized that there was a giant chasm between the state of the art of technology in 2004 and where we needed it to be so we focused on motion capture i 'm sure many of you have seen motion capture the state of the art at the time was something called marker-based motion capture i 'll give you an example here it 's basically the idea of you wear a leotard and they put some reflective markers on your body and instead of using cameras there 're infrared sensors around a volume and those infrared sensors track the three-dimensional position of those markers in real time and then animators can take the data of the motion of those markers and apply them to a computer-generated character you can see the computer characters on the right are having the same complex motion as the dancers but we also looked at numbers of other films at the time that were using facial marker tracking and that 's the idea of putting markers on the human face and doing the same process and as you can see it gives you a pretty crappy performance that 's not terribly compelling and what we realized was that what we needed was the information that was going on between the markers we needed the subtleties of the skin we needed to see skin moving over muscle moving over bone we needed creases and dimples and wrinkles and all of those things our first revelation was to completely abort and walk away from the technology of the day the status quo the state of the art so we aborted using motion capture and we were now well out of our comfort zone and in uncharted territory so we were left with this idea that we ended up calling " technology stew " we started to look out in other fields the idea was that we were going to find nuggets or gems of technology that come from other industries like medical imaging the video game space and re-appropriate them and we had to create kind of a sauce and the sauce was code in software that we 'd written to allow these disparate pieces of technology to come together and work as one initially we came across some remarkable research done by a gentleman named dr. paul ekman in the early '70s he believed that he could in fact catalog the human face and he came up with this idea of facial action coding system or facs he believed that there were 70 basic poses or shapes of the human face and that those basic poses or shapes of the face can be combined to create infinite possibilities of everything the human face is capable of doing and of course these transcend age race culture gender so this became the foundation of our research as we went forward and then we came across some remarkable technology called contour and here you can see a subject having phosphorus makeup stippled on her face and now what we 're looking at is really creating a surface capture as opposed to a marker capture the subject stands in front of a computer array of cameras and those cameras can frame-by-frame reconstruct the geometry of exactly what the subject 's doing at the moment so effectively you get 3d data in real time of the subject and if you look in a comparison on the left we see what volumetric data gives us and on the right you see what markers give us so clearly we were in a substantially better place for this but these were the early days of this technology and it was n't really proven yet we measure complexity and fidelity of data in terms of polygonal count and so on the left we were seeing 100,000 polygons we could go up into the millions of polygons it seemed to be infinite this was when we had our " aha ! " this was the breakthrough this is when we 're like " ok we 're going to be ok this is actually going to work " and the " aha ! " was what if we could take brad pitt and we could put brad in this device and use this contour process and we could stipple on this phosphorescent makeup and put him under the black lights and we could in fact scan him in real time performing ekman 's facs poses right so effectively we ended up with a 3d database of everything brad pitt 's face is capable of doing from there we actually carved up those faces into smaller pieces and components of his face so we ended up with literally thousands and thousands and thousands of shapes a complete database of all possibilities that his face is capable of doing now that 's great except we had him at age 44 we need to put another 40 years on him at this point we brought in rick baker and rick is one of the great makeup and special effects gurus of our industry and we also brought in a gentleman named kazu tsuji and kazu tsuji is one of the great photorealist sculptors of our time and we commissioned them to make a maquette or a bust of benjamin so in the spirit of " the great unveiling " -- i had to do this -- i had to unveil something so this is ben 80 we created three of these : there 's ben 80 there 's ben 70 there 's ben 60 and this really became the template for moving forward now this was made from a life cast of brad so in fact anatomically it is correct the eyes the jaw the teeth : everything is in perfect alignment with what the real guy has we have these maquettes scanned into the computer at very high resolution -- enormous polygonal count and so now we had three age increments of benjamin in the computer but we needed to get a database of him doing more than that we went through this process then called retargeting this is brad doing one of the ekman facs poses and here 's the resulting data that comes from that the model that comes from that retargeting is the process of transposing that data onto another model and because the life cast or the bust -- the maquette -- of benjamin was made from brad we could transpose the data of brad at 44 onto brad at 87 so now we had a 3d database of everything brad pitt 's face can do at age 87 in his 70s and in his 60s next we had to go into the shooting process so while all that 's going on we 're down in new orleans and locations around the world and we shot our body actors and we shot them wearing blue hoods so these are the gentleman who played benjamin and the blue hoods helped us with two things : one we could easily erase their heads ; and we also put tracking markers on their heads so we could recreate the camera motion and the lens optics from the set but now we needed to get brad 's performance to drive our virtual benjamin and so we edited the footage that was shot on location with the rest of the cast and the body actors and about six months later we brought brad onto a sound stage in los angeles and he watched on the screen his job then was to become benjamin and so we looped the scenes he watched again and again we encouraged him to improvise and he took benjamin into interesting and unusual places that we did n't think he was going to go we shot him with four hd cameras so we 'd get multiple views of him and then david would choose the take of brad being benjamin that he thought best matched the footage with the rest of the cast from there we went into a process called image analysis and so here you can see again the chosen take and you are seeing now that data being transposed on to ben 87 and so what 's interesting about this is we used something called image analysis which is taking timings from different components of benjamin 's face and so we could choose say his left eyebrow and the software would tell us that well in frame 14 the left eyebrow begins to move from here to here and it concludes moving in frame 32 and so we could choose numbers of positions on the face to pull that data from and then the sauce i talked about with our technology stew -- that secret sauce was effectively software that allowed us to match the performance footage of brad in live action with our database of aged benjamin the facs shapes that we had on a frame-by-frame basis we could actually reconstruct a 3d head that exactly matched the performance of brad so this was how the finished shot appeared in the film and here you can see the body actor and then this is what we called the " dead head " no reference to jerry garcia and then here 's the reconstructed performance now with the timings of the performance and then again the final shot it was a long process the next section here i 'm going to just blast through this because we could do a whole tedtalk on the next several slides we had to create a lighting system so really a big part of our processes was creating a lighting environment for every single location that benjamin had to appear so that we could put ben 's head into any scene and it would exactly match the lighting that 's on the other actors in the real world we also had to create an eye system we found the old adage you know " the eyes are the window to the soul " absolutely true so the key here was to keep everybody looking in ben 's eyes and if you could feel the warmth and feel the humanity and feel his intent coming through the eyes then we would succeed so we had one person focused on the eye system for almost two full years we also had to create a mouth system we worked from dental molds of brad we had to age the teeth over time we also had to create an articulating tongue that allowed him to enunciate his words there was a whole system written in software to articulate the tongue we had one person devoted to the tongue for about nine months he was very popular skin displacement : another big deal the skin had to be absolutely accurate he 's also in an old age home he 's in a nursing home around other old people so he had to look exactly the same as the others so lots of work on skin deformation you can see in some of these cases it works in some cases it looks bad this is a very very very early test in our process so effectively we created a digital puppet that brad pitt could operate with his own face there were no animators necessary to come in and interpret behavior or enhance his performance there was something that we encountered though that we ended up calling " the digital botox effect " so as things went through this process fincher would always say " it sandblasts the edges off of the performance " and thing our process and the technology could n't do is they could n't understand intent the intent of the actor so it sees a smile as a smile it does n't recognize an ironic smile or a happy smile or a frustrated smile so it did take humans to kind of push it one way or another but we ended up calling the entire process and all the technology " emotion capture " as opposed to just motion capture take another look brad pitt : well i heard momma and tizzy whisper and they said i was gon na die soon but â€¦ maybe not eu : that 's how to create a digital human in 18 minutes a couple of quick factoids ; it really took 155 people over two years and we did n't even talk about 60 hairstyles and an all-digital haircut but that is benjamin thank you [ shit ] this is arguably the back end of the design of animals but the reason i put this up here is because when i was in africa last year my wife and i were driving around we had this wonderful guide who showed us something that surprised both of us and it was very revealing in terms of the fascination that comes with the design of animals it turns out that in about the 1880s the missionaries came to africa to spread the word of christianity to teach english to the natives and they brought blackboards and chalk and i 'd like you to imagine that that 's a blackboard and i just used some chalk on there and they brought quite a bit of this stuff but over the years the blackboards were fine but they ran out of chalk and this is a real crisis for them and that 's where the hyena comes in the hyena is probably the most perfectly designed scavenging animal in the world it strip-mines carcasses and it has amazing teeth because it enables the hyena to essentially eat bones now the end product of that action is up on the board here and what the missionaries would do is they 'd walk around and they 'd pick up hyena shit and the incredible thing about hyena shit is it makes great chalk now that 's not what i 'm here to talk about but it is a fascinating aspect of animal design what i 'm here to talk about is the camel when i started talking to richard about what i was going to speak about i had recently come back from jordan where i had an amazing experience with a camel and we were in the desert -- richard wurman : that 's the end of this talk ! keith bellows : yeah yeah we were in the desert in wadi rum in a small jeep there were four of us -- two bedouin drivers -- and you can just imagine this expanse is an ocean of sand 105 degrees one water bottle and we were driving in what they told us was their very very best jeep did n't look like it to me and as we started to go through the desert the jeep broke down the guys got out they put the hood up they started working under the hood got it going again about a hundred yards it broke down this went on about six or seven times and we were getting more and more alarmed and we were also getting deeper and deeper into the desert and eventually our worst nightmare happened : they flooded the engine and they said " ah no problem ! we just get out and walk " and we said " we get out and walk " one water bottle -- remember guys -- four people and they said " yeah yeah we 'll walk we 'll find some camels " so we got out and walked and sure enough about half a mile we came over the crest of this hill and there was a huge gathering of bedouin with their camels the guy went up and started dickering and 10 dollars later we had four camels they went down like elevators ; we got on them they went back up and the bedouin -- each bedouin four of them -- got behind each of the camels with a little whip and they started slashing away at the back of the camels and they started galloping and if you 've ever been on a camel it is a very very uncomfortable ride there 's also one other aspect about these camels about every 10 steps they lean back and try to take a chunk out of your leg so we kept on going and this camel kept on trying to take a chunk out of my leg and eventually three miles later we arrived at our destination where a jeep was supposed to meet us and the camels come down again like elevators we sort of clumsily get off and they -- obviously -- try to take another chunk out of my leg and i 've developed a very wonderful relationship with this creature by this point and i 've realized that this is a mean son of a bitch and much meaner by the way than the bedouin who greeted me and tried to sell me one of his 26 daughters to take back to the states so as we talked richard and i i said " you know maybe i should bring a camel i think the camel is the best designed animal in the world " and he kind of went " nah i do n't think we want to be bringing a camel " and you should be really glad we decided not to bring the camel so i did the next best thing i went to the washington zoo richard said " i want you to get up close and personal with this camel i want you to inspect its mouth look at its teeth go underneath it go above it go around it pull its tail up ; take a look in there i want you to get as close to that camel as you possibly can " so i got a national geographic film crew we went down there and i took one look at this camel it is a 2,000 pound creature who is in rut now if you 've ever seen a 2,000 pound camel in a rut it is a scary scary thing to behold and if richard thought i was getting in the ring with that camel someone was smoking bedouin high grade so we got as close to it as possible and i 'm going to share this -- chris if you want to roll this film -- and then i 'm going to show you a little bit more about the design of camels do you want to roll the film hello this is keith bellows with the national geographic camel investigation unit i 'm here to look at the ultimate desert machine and you 'll note i started chewing gum because i was around this camel all day senior keeper : that 's it that 's it ok. no ! see now he 's getting a little overexcited so we 'll need to be very careful around him do n't let him get you now you can see copious amounts of saliva in there [ unclear ] i call myself the unstable stable boy their nose -- you can see his nose is flared right now when they 're in rut -- they 're similar to seals in the way like a seal has to open its nose to breathe and they 're similar they have to kind of consciously open their nose ears they are small but they have excellent hearing but not a big -- for instance in zebras they have a huge ear that 's very mobile so they can actually turn them both around and they use them in the same way we use our binocular vision they use them to pinpoint sound the desert 's extremely windy as well as being very cold so not only do they have the very long eyelashes but there 's the secondary -- i guess you 'd call it the [ unclear ] or whatever it 's this hair that 's above the eyes and below it it 's longer most people think that the humps store water they do n't they store fat but -- now i 'm not a chemist but basically what happens is the fat is oxidized by their breathing and that will turn it into actually usable water like a lot of predators they walk on their toes but there 's a big fat pad in there that squishes out they 're like sun shoes but you know with sand hooves they do n't have traditional hooves but they do have one like big nail you ca n't really see too clear the fur 's kind of grown over but they use their tails a lot especially in rut he will urinate and spin his tail to spread the urine around and make him more attractive i do n't know why that would be but it works for them so what the hell now they will also defecate in certain areas generally they poop wherever they want to but during their rut they will defecate in perimeter areas i do n't know if you 've read or heard about the sub-sonic sounds from elephants -- you know what i mean like " br-r-r ! " these big big rumbling sounds he will do the same thing you can actually see right here it will vibrate we weigh our animals unfortunately he 's a very aggressive animal so he 's actually destroyed some of the scales we had these big things that i weigh the bison on for instance i 'm guessing that he -- well he 's at least 1,600 pounds he 's basically a walking mulch pile we 're kind of like buds but i 'm also a male as well and he 's -- kb : he sees you as competition senior keeper : yeah exactly and it makes him very dangerous at this time of year do n't even think about it do n't think about it ! but now we 're going to meet -- out ! out ! out ! no out ! kb : what i did n't show you was -- you got that swinging thing going well -- and you 're glad i did n't show you this one of the other things about the camel 's beautiful design is that its penis points backwards that way the camel can dip its tail in the stream and just whacker the entire area around him and that 's how he really marks his territory now what you also did n't see was that -- and you may have noticed in the pen beside him and by the way the camel 's name is suki in the pen beside him is jasmine jasmine has been his mate for some time but on this particular occasion it was very very clear that as horny as suki was jasmine was having none of it and so we started thinking well if poor old suki is in search of a mate what would suki do to find the perfect mate so i 'm going to show you another film but before i do i just want to mention that this animal truly is a sort of the suv of the sand the ship of the desert it 's so vital to the inhabitants of the areas in which the camel is found -- largely mongolia and sahara -- that there are 160 words in arabic to describe the camel and if this is a creature that was designed by committee it 's certainly been like no committee i 've ever been on so here 's what suki would do in search of a mate can you roll it please camel seeking camel lusty beast desires attractive & amp ; sincere mate i 'm seven ft. 2,000 lbs. with brown hair/eyes long legs â€¦ and i 'm very well â€¦ hung i 'm ted camel the perfect desert machine i 'm smartly designed eyelashes that keep out sand and a third eyelash that works like a windshield wiper a distinguished nose with nostrils lined to filter out sand and dust and a groove that catches moisture amazingly full lips that allow me to eat practically anything that grows callouses on my knees that let me kneel comfortably leathery chest pads that beat the heat short fur that keeps my skin cool long legs that allow heat to escape and my hump ogden nash once wrote : " the camel has a single hump ; the dromedary two or else the other way around i 'm never sure are you " here 's a hint : bactarian dromedary my hump contains up to 80 lbs of fat -- but does n't store h2o i 'm built to last i 'm the go-to animal when the oasis is dry i usually wo n't sweat until my body reaches 105 degrees f -- enough to fry an egg i 'm able to lose 40 percent of my weight without dying i 'll drink five to seven gallons of water a day but go without for more than a month i 'm powerful able to pack up to 400 lbs of cargo outrun a horse and cover 26 miles on a good day camelot jackie o. once said that traveling by camel made riding an elephant seem like taking a jet plane yet my large soft feet allow me to navigate sand i 'm a good provider too bedouins call the camel the gift of god no surprise tents and rugs are made of my hair my dried bones are prized as a sort of ivory my dung is burned as fuel my milk is used for cheese " camels are like angels " a bedouin once said thank you i just want to leave you with one last thought which is probably the most important thing to take away humans -- the animal -- are pretty lucky creatures because by and large we really do n't have to adapt to our environment ; we adapt our environment to us and we 've seen that repeatedly through this conference -- not just this year but in past years but this creature that you 've just seen ultimately adapts and keeps adapting and adapting and i think when you look at the animal kingdom that is one of the most remarkable things it does n't have an environment that adapts to it ; it has to adapt to the environment ricky thank you very much for having me rw : that 's terrific thank you thank you and i feel like this whole evening has been very amazing to me i feel it 's sort of like the vimalakirti sutra an ancient work from ancient india in which the buddha appears at the beginning and a whole bunch of people come to see him from the biggest city in the area vaishali and they bring some sort of jeweled parasols to make an offering to him all the young people actually from the city the old fogeys do n't come because they 're mad at buddha because when he came to their city he accepted -- he always accepts the first invitation that comes to him from whoever it is and the local geisha a movie-star sort of person raced the elders of the city in a chariot and invited him first so he was hanging out with the movie star and of course they were grumbling : " he 's supposed to be religious and all this what 's he doing over there at amrapali 's house with all his 500 monks " and so on they were all grumbling and so they boycotted him they would n't go listen to him but the young people all came and they brought this kind of a jeweled parasol and they put it on the ground and as soon as they had laid all these all their big stack of these jeweled parasols that they used to carry in ancient india he performed a kind of special effect which made it into a giant planetarium the wonder of the universe everyone looked in that and they saw in there the total interconnectedness of all life in all universes and of course in the buddhist cosmos there are millions and billions of planets with human life on it and enlightened beings can see the life on all the other planets so they do n't -- when they look out and they see those lights that you showed in the sky -- they do n't just see sort of pieces of matter burning or rocks or flames or gases exploding they actually see landscapes and human beings and gods and dragons and serpent beings and goddesses and things like that he made that special effect at the beginning to get everyone to think about interconnection and interconnectedness and how everything in life was totally interconnected and then leilei -- i know his other name -- told us about interconnection and how we 're all totally interconnected here and how we 've all known each other and of course in the buddhist universe we 've already done this already billions of times in many many lifetimes in the past and i did n't give the talk always you did and we had to watch you and so forth and we 're all still trying to i guess we 're all trying to become tedsters if that 's a modern form of enlightenment i guess so because in a way if a tedster relates to all the interconnectedness of all the computers and everything it 's the forging of a mass awareness of where everybody can really know everything that 's going on everywhere in the planet and therefore it will become intolerable -- what compassion is is where it will become intolerable for us totally intolerable that we sit here in comfort and in pleasure and enjoying the life of the mind or whatever it is and there are people who are absolutely riddled with disease and they can not have a bite of food and they have no place or they 're being brutalized by some terrible person and so forth it just becomes intolerable with all of us knowing everything we 're kind of forced by technology to become buddhas or something to become enlightened and of course we all will be deeply disappointed when we do because we think that because we are kind of tired of what we do a little bit tired we do suffer we do enjoy our misery in a certain way we distract ourselves from our misery by running around somewhere but basically we all have this common misery that we are sort of stuck inside our skins and everyone else is out there and occasionally we get together with another person stuck in their skin and the two of us enjoy each other and each one tries to get out of their own and ultimately it fails of course and then we 're back into this thing because our egocentric perception -- from the buddha 's point of view misperception -- is that all we are is what is inside our skin and it 's inside and outside self and other and other is all very different and everyone here is unfortunately carrying that habitual perception a little bit right you know someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that 's ok because you 're in a theater but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you you 'd freak out what do they want from me like who 's that and so you would n't sit that close to another person because of your notion that it 's you versus the universe -- that 's all buddha discovered because that cosmic basic idea that it is us all alone each of us and everyone else is different then that puts us in an impossible situation does n't it who is it who 's going to get enough attention from the world who 's going to get enough out of the world who 's not going to be overrun by an infinite number of other beings -- if you 're different from all the other beings so where compassion comes is where you surprisingly discover you lose yourself in some way : through art through meditation through understanding through knowledge actually knowing that you have no such boundary knowing your interconnectedness with other beings you can experience yourself as the other beings when you see through the delusion of being separated from them when you do that you 're forced to feel what they feel luckily they say -- i still am not sure -- but luckily they say that when you reach that point because some people have said in the buddhist literature they say " oh who would really want to be compassionate how awful ! i 'm so miserable on my own my head is aching my bones are aching i go from birth to death i 'm never satisfied i never have enough even if i 'm a billionaire i do n't have enough i need a hundred billion " so i 'm like that imagine if i had to feel even a hundred other people 's suffering it would be terrible but apparently this is a strange paradox of life when you 're no longer locked in yourself and as the wisdom or the intelligence or the scientific knowledge of the nature of the world that enables you to let your mind spread out and empathize and enhance the basic human ability of empathizing and realizing that you are the other being somehow by that opening you can see the deeper nature of life and you can you get away from this terrible iron circle of i me me mine like the beatles used to sing you know we really learned everything in the '60s too bad nobody ever woke up to it and they 've been trying to suppress it since then i me me mine it 's like a perfect song that song a perfect teaching but when we 're relieved from that we somehow then become interested in all the other beings and we feel ourselves differently it 's totally strange it 's totally strange the dalai lama always likes to say -- he says that when you give birth in your mind to the idea of compassion it 's because you realize that you yourself and your pains and pleasures are finally too small a theater for your intelligence it 's really too boring whether you feel like this or like that or what you know -- and the more you focus on how you feel by the way the worse it gets like even when you 're having a good time when is the good time over the good time is over when you think how good is it and then it 's never good enough i love that leilei said that the way of helping those who are suffering badly on the physical plane or on other planes is having a good time doing it by having a good time i think the dalai lama should have heard that i wish he 'd been there to hear that he once told me -- he looked kind of sad ; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots he looked a little sad because he said well a hundred years ago they went and took everything away from the haves you know the big communist revolutions russia and china and so forth they took it all away by violence saying they were going to give it to everyone and then they were even worse they did n't help at all so what could possibly change this terrible gap that has opened up in the world today and so then he looks at me so i said " well you know you 're all in this yourself you teach : it 's generosity " was all i could think of what is virtue but of course what you said i think the key to saving the world the key to compassion is that it is more fun it should be done by fun generosity is more fun that 's the key everybody has the wrong idea they think buddha was so boring and they 're so surprised when they meet dalai lama and he 's fairly jolly even though his people are being genocided -- and believe me he feels every blow on every old nun 's head in every chinese prison he feels it he feels the way they are harvesting yaks nowadays i wo n't even say what they do but he feels it and yet he 's very jolly he 's extremely jolly because when you open up like that then you ca n't just -- what good does it do to add being miserable with others ' misery you have to find some vision where you see how hopeful it is how it can be changed look at that beautiful thing chiho showed us she scared us with the lava man she scared us with the lava man is coming then the tsunami is coming but then finally there were flowers and trees and it was very beautiful it 's really lovely so compassion means to feel the feelings of others and the human being actually is compassion the human being is almost out of time the human being is compassion because what is our brain for now jim 's brain is memorizing the almanac but he could memorize all the needs of all the beings that he is he will he did he could memorize all kinds of fantastic things to help many beings and he would have tremendous fun doing that so the first person who gets happy when you stop focusing on the self-centered situation of how happy am i where you 're always dissatisfied -- as mick jagger told us you never get any satisfaction that way so then you decide " well i 'm sick of myself i 'm going to think of how other people can be happy i 'm going to get up in the morning and think what can i do for even one other person even a dog my dog my cat my pet my butterfly " and the first person who gets happy when you do that you do n't do anything for anybody else but you get happier you yourself because your whole perception broadens and you suddenly see the whole world and all of the people in it and you realize that this -- being with these people -- is the flower garden that chiho showed us it is nirvana and my time is up and i know the ted commandments thank you i started juggling a long time ago but long before that i was a golfer and that 's what i was a golfer and as a golfer and as a kid one of the things that really sort of seeped into my pores that i sort of lived my whole life is process and it 's the process of learning things one of the great things was that my father was an avid golfer but he was lefty and he had a real passion for golf and he also created this whole mythology about ben hogan and various things well i learned a lot about interesting things that i knew nothing about at the time but grew to know stuff about and that was the mythology of skill so one of the things that i love to do is to explore skill and since richard put me on this whole thing with music -- i 'm supposed to actually be doing a project with tod machover with the mit media lab -- it relates a lot to music but tod could n't come and the project is sort of somewhere i 'm not sure whether it 's happening the way we thought or not but i 'm going to explore skill and juggling and basically visual music i guess ok you can start the music thanks thanks thank you now juggling can be a lot of fun ; play with skill and play with space play with rhythm and you can turn the mike on now i 'm going to do a couple of pieces i do a big piece in a triangle and these are three sections from it part of the challenge was to try to understand rhythm and space using not just my hands -- because a lot of juggling is hand-oriented -- but using the rhythm of my body and feet and controlling the balls with my feet thanks now this next section was an attempt to explore space you see i think richard said something about people that are against something well a lot of people think jugglers defy gravity or do stuff well i kind of from my childhood and golf and all that it 's a process of joining with forces and so what i 'd like to do is try to figure out how to join with the space through the technique so juggling gravity -- up down if you figure out what up and down really are it 's a complex physical set of skills to be able to throw a ball down and up and everything but then you add in sideways now i look at it somewhat as a way -- when you learn juggling what you learn is how to feel with your eyes and see with your hands because you 're not looking at your hands you 're looking at where the balls are or you 're looking at the audience so this next part is really a way of understanding space and rhythm with the obvious reference to the feet but it 's also time -- where the feet were where the balls were thanks so visual music : rhythm and complexity i 'm going to build towards complexity now juggling three balls is simple and normal excuse me we 're jugglers ok. and remember you 're transposing you 're getting into a subculture here and juggling -- the balls cross and all that ok if you keep them in their assigned paths you get parallel lines of different heights but then hopefully even rhythm and you can change the rhythm -- good michael you can change the rhythm if you get out of the lights ok change the rhythm so it 's even or you can go back and change the height now skill but you 're boxed in if you can only do it up and down that way so you 've got to go after the space down there ok then you 've got to combine them because then you have the whole spatial palette in front of you and then you get crazy now i 'm actually going to ask you to try something so you 've got to pay attention complexity : if you spend enough time doing something time slows down or your skill increases so your perceptions change it 's learning skills -- like being in a high-speed car crash things slow down as you learn as you learn as you learn you may not be able to affect it it almost drifts on you it goes but that 's the closest approximation i can have to it so complexity now how many here are jugglers ok so most of you are going to have a similar reaction to this ok and whoever laughed there -- you understood it completely right no it looks like a mess it looks like a mess with a guy there who 's got his hands around that mess ok well that 's what juggling is about right it 's being able to do something that other people ca n't do or ca n't understand all right so that 's one way of doing it which is five balls down ok another way is the outside and you could play with the rhythm same pattern make it faster and smaller make it wider make it narrower bring it back up ok it 's done thanks now what i wanted to get to is that you 're all very bright very tactile i have no idea how computer-oriented or three-dimensionally-oriented you are but let 's try something ok so since you all do n't understand what the five-ball pattern is i 'm going to give you a little clue enough of a clue so you get the pattern right ok you 're not getting off that easy all right now do me a favor : follow the ball that i ask you to follow green yellow pink white ok you can do that yeah ok now let 's actually learn something actually let me put you in that area of learning which is very insecure you want to do it yeah ok hands out in front of you palms up together what you 're going to learn is this ok so what i want you to do is just listen to me and do it index finger middle finger ring little little ring middle index and then open finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger a little bit faster finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger all right a lot of different learning processes going on in here one learning process that i see is this -- ok. another learning process that i see is this -- ok so everybody take a deep breath in breath out ok now one more time and -- finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger open finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger ok shake your hands out now i assume a lot of you spend a lot of time at a computer ok so what you 're doing is you 're going la la la and you 're getting this ok so that 's exactly what i 'm going to ask you to do but in a slightly different way you 're going to combine it so what i want you to do is -- fingers i 'll tell you what to do with your fingers same thing but i want you to do is also with your eyes is follow the colored ball that i ask you to follow ok here we go so we 're going to start off looking at the white ball -- and i 'm going to tell you which color and i 'm also going to tell you to go with your fingers ok so white ball and -- finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger pink finger finger finger finger finger finger finger finger green finger finger finger finger yellow finger finger finger pink or finger pink finger finger finger finger finger finger finger all right how did you do well ok the reason i wanted you to do this is because that 's actually what most people face throughout their lives a moment of learning a moment of challenge it 's a moment that you ca n't make sense of why the hell should i learn this ok does it really have anything to do with anything in my life you know i ca n't decipher -- is it fun is it challenging am i supposed to cheat you know what are you supposed to do you 've got somebody up here who is the operative principle of doing that for his whole life ok trying to figure that stuff out but is it going to get you anywhere it 's just a moment that 's all it is a moment ok i 'm going to change the script for one second just let me do this i do n't need music for it talking about time in a moment there 's a piece that i recently developed which was all about that a moment and what i do as a creative artist is i develop vocabularies or languages of moving objects what i 've done for you here i developed a lot of those tricks and i put the choreography together but they 're not original techniques now i 'm going to start showing you some original techniques that come from the work that i 've developed ok so a moment how would you define a moment well as a juggler what i wanted to do was create something that was representational of a moment ahhh all right i 'm going to get on my knees and do it so a moment ok and then what i did as a juggler was say ok what can i do to make that something that is dependent on something else another dynamic so a moment another moment excuse me still getting there a moment that travels a moment -- no we 'll try that again it separates and comes back together time how can you look at time and what do you dedicate it to in exploring a particular thing well obviously there 's something in here and you can all have a guess as to what it is there 's a mystery there 's a mystery in the moment and it has to settle and then it 's dependent on something else and then it comes to rest just a little thing about time now this has expanded into a much bigger piece because i use ramps of different parabolas that i roll the balls on while i 'm keeping time with this but i just thought i 'd talk about a moment all right ok. can we show the video of the triangle are we ready to do that yes this is the piece that i told you about it 's a much bigger piece that i do exploring the space of a geometric triangle thanks the only thing i 'll say about the last session is you ever try juggling and driving the car with your knees at 120 miles an hour the only other thing is it was a real shock i always drove motorcycles and when i bought my first car it shocked me that it cost three times more than my parents ' house interesting anyway balance : constant movement to find an approach to stillness cheating balance : making up the rules so you ca n't cheat so you learn to approach stillness with different parts of your body to have a conversation with it to speak to listen hup now it 's dependent on rhythm and keeping a center of balance when it falls going underneath so there 's a rhythm to it the rhythm can get much smaller as your skill increases you learn to find those tinier spaces those tinier movements thanks now i 'm going to show you the beginnings of a piece that is about balance in some ways and also -- oh actually if you 're bored not here here 's one use for it you can go with the " sticks one " music thanks that has a certain kind of balance to it which is all about plumb i apprenticed with a carpenter and learned about plumb square and level and they influenced that and this next piece which i 'll do a little segment of " two sticks " you can go with it thanks which is again exploring space or the lines in space working with space and the lines in space in a different way oh let 's see here so i 'll come back to that in a second but working with one ball now what if you attach something to it or change it this is a little thing that i made because i really like the idea of curves and balls together and then creating space and the rhythm of space using the surface of the balls the surface of the arms just a little toy which leads me to the next thing which is -- what have i got here ok. all right i 'm actually leading up to something the newest thing that i 'm working on this is not it this is exploring geometry and the rhythm of shape now what i just did was i worked with the mathematics -- the diameter and the circumference sometimes these pieces are mathematical in that way that i look at a shape and say what about if i use this and this and this sometimes what happens in life affects my choice of objects that i try to work with the next piece that i 'm going to do -- which is the cylinders piece if you want to get that up -- it has to do with cylinder seals from about 5,000 years ago which were stones with designs that were used to roll over wet clay with all sorts of great designs i love ceramics and all of that it 's a combination of that the beauty of that the shape and the stories that were involved in it as well as the fact that they protected the contents the second influence on this piece came from recycling and looking into a tin can recycling bin and seeing all that beautiful emptiness so if you want to go with the music for cylinders talking about geometry and everything if you take the circle and you split it in half -- can you run " s-curve music " i 'm going to do just a short version of it circles split in half and rotated and mythology anyway that piece also has a kinetic sculpture in the middle of it and i dance around a small stage so -- two minutes just to end the latest piece that i 'm working on -- what i love is that i never know what i 'm working on why i 'm working on it they 're not ideas they 're instincts and the latest thing that i 'm working on -- -- is something really -- i do n't know what it is yet and that 's good i like not to know for as long as possible well because then it tells me the truth instead of me imposing the truth and what it is is working with both positive and negative space but also with these curves and what it involves and i do n't know if my hands are too beaten up to do it or not but i 'll do a little bit of it it initially started off with me stacking these things bunches of them and then playing with the sense of space of filling in the space and then it started changing and become folding on themselves and then changing levels because my attempt is to make visual instruments not to just make -- i 'll try one other thing for work in three dimensions with your perceptions of space and time now i do n't know exactly where it 's going but i 've got a bit of effort involved in this thing and it 's going to change as i go through it but i really like it it feels right this may not be the right shape and -- look at this shape and then i 'll show you the first design i ever put to it just to see just to play because i love all different kinds of things to play with to work with the positive and negative in a different way and to change and to change so i 'm off in my new direction with this to explore rhythm and space we 'll see what i come up with thanks for having me my mission in life since i was a kid was and is to take the rest of you into space it 's during our lifetime that we 're going to take the earth take the people of earth and transition off permanently and that 's exciting in fact i think it is a moral imperative that we open the space frontier you know it 's the first time that we 're going to have a chance to have planetary redundancy a chance to if you would back up the biosphere and if you think about space everything we hold of value on this planet -- metals and minerals and real estate and energy -- is in infinite quantities in space in fact the earth is a crumb in a supermarket filled with resources the analogy for me is alaska you know we bought alaska we americans bought alaska in the 1850s it 's called seward 's folly we valued it as the number of seal pelts we could kill and then we discovered these things -- gold and oil and fishing and timber -- and it became you know a trillion-dollar economy and now we take our honeymoons there the same thing will happen in space we are on the verge of the greatest exploration that the human race has ever known we explore for three reasons the weakest of which is curiosity you know it 's funded nasa 's budget up until now some images from mars 1997 in fact i think in the next decade without any question we will discover life on mars and find that it is literally ubiquitous under the soils and different parts of that planet the stronger motivator the much stronger motivator is fear it drove us to the moon we -- literally in fear -- with the soviet union raced to the moon and we have these huge rocks you know killer-sized rocks in the hundreds of thousands or millions out there and while the probability is very small the impact figured in literally of one of these hitting the earth is so huge that to spend a small fraction looking searching preparing to defend is not unreasonable and of course the third motivator one near and dear to my heart as an entrepreneur is wealth in fact the greatest wealth if you think about these other asteroids there 's a class of the nickel iron which in platinum-group metal markets alone are worth something like 20 trillion dollars if you can go out and grab one of these rocks my plan is to actually buy puts on the precious metal market and then actually claim that i 'm going to go out and get one and that will fund the actual mission to go and get one but fear curiosity and greed have driven us and for me this is -- i 'm the short kid on the right this was -- my motivation was actually during apollo and apollo was one of the greatest motivators ever if you think about what happened at the turn of -- early 1960s on may 25 jfk said " we 're going to go to the moon " and people left their jobs and they went to obscure locations to go and be part of this amazing mission and we knew nothing about going to space we went from having literally put alan shepard in suborbital flight to going to the moon in eight years and the average age of the people that got us there was 26 years old they did n't know what could n't be done they had to make up everything and that my friend is amazing motivation this is gene cernan a good friend of mine saying " if i can go to the moon " -- this is the last human on the moon so far -- " nothing nothing is impossible " but of course we 've thought about the government always as the person taking us there but i put forward here the government is not going to get us there the government is unable to take the risks required to open up this precious frontier the shuttle is costing a billion dollars a launch that 's a pathetic number it 's unreasonable we should n't be happy in standing for that one of the things that we did with the ansari x prize was take the challenge on that risk is ok you know as we are going out there and taking on a new frontier we should be allowed to risk in fact anyone who says we should n't you know just needs to be put aside because as we go forward in fact the greatest discoveries we will ever know is ahead of us the entrepreneurs in the space business are the furry mammals and clearly the industrial-military complex -- with boeing and lockheed and nasa -- are the dinosaurs the ability for us to access these resources to gain planetary redundancy -- we can now gather all the information the genetic codes you know everything stored on our databases and back them up off the planet in case there would be one of those disastrous situations the difficulty is getting there and clearly the cost to orbit is key once you 're in orbit you are two thirds of the way energetically to anywhere -- the moon to mars and today there 's only three vehicles -- the u.s. shuttle the russian soyuz and the chinese vehicle -- that gets you there arguably it 's about 100 million dollars a person on the space shuttle one of the companies i started space adventures will sell you a ticket we 've done two so far we 'll be announcing two more on the soyuz to go up to the space station for 20 million dollars but that 's expensive and to understand what the potential is -- -- it is expensive but people are willing to pay that ! you know one -- we have a very unique period in time today for the first time ever we have enough wealth concentrated in the hands of few individuals and the technology accessible that will allow us to really drive space exploration but how cheap could it get i want to give you the end point we know -- 20 million dollars today you can go and buy a ticket but how cheap could it get let 's go back to high school physics here if you calculate the amount of potential energy mgh to take you and your spacesuit up to a couple hundred miles and then you accelerate yourself to 17,500 miles per hour -- remember that one half mv squared -- and you figure it out it 's about 5.7 gigajoules of energy if you expended that over an hour it 's about 1.6 megawatts if you go to one of vijay 's micro-power sources and they sell it to you for seven cents a kilowatt hour -- anybody here fast in math how much will it cost you and your spacesuit to go to orbit 100 bucks that 's the price-improvement curve that -- we need some breakthroughs in physics along the way i 'll grant you that but guys if history has taught us anything it 's that if you can imagine it you will get there eventually i have no question that the physics the engineering to get us down to the point where all of us can afford orbital space flight is around the corner the difficulty is that there needs to be a real marketplace to drive the investment today the boeings and the lockheeds do n't spend a dollar of their own money in r & amp ; d it 's all government research dollars and very few of those and in fact the large corporations the governments ca n't take the risk so we need what i call an exothermic economic reaction in space today 's commercial markets worldwide global commercial launch market 12 to 15 launches per year number of commercial companies out there 12 to 15 companies one per company that 's not it there 's only one marketplace and i call them self-loading carbon payloads they come with their own money they 're easy to make it 's people the ansari x prize was my solution reading about lindbergh for creating the vehicles to get us there we offered 10 million dollars in cash for the first reusable ship carry three people up to 100 kilometers come back down and within two weeks make the trip again twenty-six teams from seven countries entered the competition spending between one to 25 million dollars each and of course we had beautiful spaceshipone which made those two flights and won the competition and i 'd like to take you there to that morning for just a quick video pilot : release our fire richard searfoss : good luck rs : we 've got an altitude call of 368,000 feet rs : so in my official capacity as the chief judge of the ansari x prize competition i declare that mojave aerospace ventures has indeed earned the ansari x prize peter diamandis : probably the most difficult thing that i had to do was raise the capital for this it was literally impossible we went -- i went to 100 200 ceos cmos no one believed it was done everyone said " oh what does nasa think well people are going to die how can you possibly going to put this forward " i found a visionary family the ansari family and champ car and raised part of the money but not the full 10 million and what i ended up doing was going out to the insurance industry and buying a hole-in-one insurance policy see the insurance companies went to boeing and lockheed and said " are you going to compete " no " are you going to compete " no " no one 's going to win this thing " so they took a bet that no one would win by january of '05 and i took a bet that someone would win so -- and the best thing is they paid off and the check did n't bounce we 've had a lot of accomplishments and it 's been a tremendous success one of the things i 'm most happy about is that the spaceshipone is going to hang in air and space museum next to the spirit of st. louis and the wright flyer is n't that great so a little bit about the future steps to space what 's available for you today you can go and experience weightless flights by '08 suborbital flights the price tag for that you know on virgin is going to be about 200,000 there are three or four other serious efforts that will bring the price down very rapidly i think to about 25,000 dollars for a suborbital flight orbital flights -- we can take you to the space station and then i truly believe once a group is in orbit around the earth -- i know if they do n't do it i am -- we 're going to stockpile some fuel make a beeline for the moon and grab some real estate quick moment for the designers in the audience we spent 11 years getting faa approval to do zero gravity flights here are some fun images here 's burt rutan and my good friend greg meronek inside a zero gravity -- people think a zero gravity room there 's a switch on there that turns it off -- but it 's actually parabolic flight of an airplane and turns out 7-up has just done a little commercial that 's airing this month if we can get the audio up narrator : for a chance to win the first free ticket to space look for specially marked packages of diet 7-up when you want the taste that wo n't weigh you down the only way to go is up pd : that was filmed inside our airplane and so you can now do this we 're based down in florida let me talk about the other thing i 'm excited about the future of prizes you know prizes are a very old idea i had the pleasure of borrowing from the longitude prize and the orteig prize that put lindbergh forward and we have made a decision in the x prize foundation to actually carry that concept forward into other technology areas and we just took on a new mission statement : " to bring about radical breakthroughs in space and other technologies for the benefit of humanity " and this is something that we 're very excited about i showed this slide to larry page who just joined our board and you know when you give to a nonprofit you might have 50 cents on the dollar if you have a matching grant it 's typically two or three to one if you put up a prize you can get literally a 50 to one leverage on your dollars and that 's huge and then he turned around and said " well if you back a prize institute that runs a 10 prize you get 500 to one " i said " well that 's great " so we have actually -- are looking to turn the x prize into a world-class prize institute this is what happens when you put up a prize when you announce it and teams start to begin doing trials you get publicity increase and when it 's won publicity shoots through the roof -- if it 's properly managed -- and that 's part of the benefits to a sponsor then when the prize is actually won after it 's moving you get societal benefits you know new technology new capability and the benefit to the sponsors is the sum of the publicity and societal benefits over the long term that 's our value proposition in a prize if you were going to go and try to create spaceshipone or any kind of a new technology you have to fund that from the beginning and maintain that funding with an uncertain outcome it may or may not happen but if you put up a prize the beautiful thing is you know it 's a very small maintenance fee and you pay on success orteig did n't pay a dime out to the nine teams that went across -- tried to go across the atlantic and we did n't pay a dime until someone won the ansari x prize so prizes work great you know innovators the entrepreneurs out there you know that when you 're going for a goal the first thing you have to do is believe that you can do it yourself then you 've got to you know face potential public ridicule of -- that 's a crazy idea it 'll never work and then you have to convince others so that they can in fact help you raise the funds and then you 've got to deal with the fact that you 've got government bureaucracies and institutions that do n't want you to move those things forward and you have to deal with failures what a prize does what we 've experienced a prize doing is literally help to short-circuit or support all of these things because a prize credentials the idea that this is a good idea well it must be a good idea someone 's offering 10 million dollars to go and do this thing and each of these areas was something that we found the ansari x prize helped short-circuit these for innovation so as an organization we put together a prize discovery process of how to come up with prizes and write the rules and we 're actually looking at creating prizes in a number of different categories we 're looking at attacking energy environment nanotechnology -- and i 'll talk about those more in a moment and the way we 're doing that is we 're creating prize teams within the x prize we have a space prize team we 're going after an orbital prize we are looking at a number of energy prizes craig venter has just joined our board and we 're doing a rapid genome sequencing prize with him we 'll be announcing later this fall about -- imagine being able to sequence anybody 's dna for under 1,000 dollars revolutionize medicine and clean water education medicine and even looking at social entrepreneurship so my final slide here is the most critical tool for solving humanity 's grand challenges -- it is n't technology it is n't money it 's only one thing -- it 's the committed passionate human mind i 'm speaking about compassion from an islamic point of view and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion the truth of the matter is otherwise our holy book the koran consists of 114 chapters and each chapter begins with what we call the basmala the saying of " in the name of god the all compassionate the all merciful " or as sir richard burton -- not the richard burton who was married to elizabeth taylor but the sir richard burton who lived a century before that and who was a worldwide traveler and translator of many works of literature -- translates it " in the name of god the compassionating the compassionate " and in a saying of the koran which to muslims is god speaking to humanity god says to his prophet muhammad -- whom we believe to be the last of a series of prophets beginning with adam including noah including moses including abraham including jesus christ and ending with muhammad -- that " we have not sent you o muhammad except as a 'rahmah ' except as a source of compassion to humanity " for us human beings and certainly for us as muslims whose mission and whose purpose in following the path of the prophet is to make ourselves as much like the prophet and the prophet in one of his sayings said " adorn yourselves with the attributes of god " and because god himself said that the primary attribute of his is compassion -- in fact the koran says that " god decreed upon himself compassion " or " reigned himself in by compassion " -- therefore our objective and our mission must be to be sources of compassion activators of compassion actors of compassion and speakers of compassion and doers of compassion that is all well and good but where do we go wrong and what is the source of the lack of compassion in the world for the answer to this we turn to our spiritual path in every religious tradition there is the outer path and the inner path or the exoteric path and the esoteric path the esoteric path of islam is more popularly known as sufism or " tasawwuf " in arabic and these doctors or these masters these spiritual masters of the sufi tradition refer to teachings and examples of our prophet that teach us where the source of our problems lies in one of the battles that the prophet waged he told his followers " we are returning from the lesser war to the greater war to the greater battle " and they said " messenger of god we are battle-weary how can we go to a greater battle " he said " that is the battle of the self the battle of the ego " the sources of human problems have to do with egotism " i " the famous sufi master rumi who is very well known to most of you has a story in which he talks of a man who goes to the house of a friend and he knocks on the door and a voice answers " who 's there " " it 's me " or more grammatically correctly " it is i " as we might say in english the voice says " go away " after many years of training of disciplining of search and struggle he comes back with much greater humility he knocks again on the door the voice asks " who is there " he said " it is you o heartbreaker " the door swings open and the voice says " come in for there is no room in this house for two i 's " -- two capital i 's not these eyes -- " for two egos " and rumi 's stories are metaphors for the spiritual path in the presence of god there is no room for more than one " i " and that is the " i " of divinity in a teaching -- called a " hadith qudsi " in our tradition -- god says that " my servant " or " my creature my human creature does not approach me by anything that is dearer to me than what i have asked them to do " and those of you who are employers know exactly what i mean you want your employees to do what you ask them to do and if they 've done that then they can do extra but do n't ignore what you 've asked them to do " and " god says " my servant continues to get nearer to me by doing more of what i 've asked them to do " -- extra credit we might call it -- " until i love him or love her and when i love my servant " god says " i become the eyes by which he or she sees the ears by which he or she listens the hand by which he or she grasps and the foot by which he or she walks and the heart by which he or she understands " it is this merging of our self with divinity that is the lesson and purpose of our spiritual path and all of our faith traditions muslims regard jesus as the master of sufism the greatest prophet and messenger who came to emphasize the spiritual path when he says " i am the spirit and i am the way " and when the prophet muhammad said " whoever has seen me has seen god " it is because they became so much an instrument of god they became part of god 's team -- so that god 's will was manifest through them and they were not acting from their own selves and their own egos compassion on earth is given it is in us all we have to do is to get our egos out of the way get our egotism out of the way i 'm sure probably all of you here or certainly the very vast majority of you have had what you might call a spiritual experience a moment in your lives when for a few seconds a minute perhaps the boundaries of your ego dissolved and at that minute you felt at one with the universe -- one with that jug of water one with every human being one with the creator -- and you felt you were in the presence of power of awe of the deepest love the deepest sense of compassion and mercy that you have ever experienced in your lives that is a moment which is a gift of god to us -- a gift when for a moment he lifts that boundary which makes us insist on " i i i me me me " and instead like the person in rumi 's story we say " oh this is all you this is all you and this is all us and us and i and us are all part of you o creator ! o the objective ! the source of our being and the end of our journey you are also the breaker of our hearts you are the one whom we should all be towards for whose purpose we live and for whose purpose we shall die and for whose purpose we shall be resurrected again to account to god to what extent we have been compassionate beings " our message today and our purpose today and those of you who are here today and the purpose of this charter of compassion is to remind for the koran always urges us to remember to remind each other because the knowledge of truth is within every human being we know it all we have access to it all jung may have called it " the subconscious " through our subconscious in your dreams -- the koran calls our state of sleep " the lesser death " " the temporary death " -- in our state of sleep we have dreams we have visions we travel even outside of our bodies for many of us and we see wonderful things we travel beyond the limitations of space as we know it and beyond the limitations of time as we know it but all this is for us to glorify the name of the creator whose primary name is the compassionating the compassionate god bokh whatever name you want to call him with allah ram om whatever the name might be through which you name or access the presence of divinity it is the locus of absolute being absolute love and mercy and compassion and absolute knowledge and wisdom what hindus call " satchidananda " the language differs but the objective is the same rumi has another story about three men a turk an arab and -- and i forget the third person but for my sake it could be a malay one is asking for angur -- one is say an englishman -- one is asking for eneb and one is asking for grapes and they have a fight and an argument because -- " i want grapes " " i want eneb " i want angur " -- not knowing that the word that they 're using refers to the same reality in different languages there 's only one absolute reality by definition one absolute being by definition because absolute is by definition single and absolute and singular there 's this absolute concentration of being the absolute concentration of consciousness awareness an absolute locus of compassion and love that defines the primary attributes of divinity and these should also be the primary attributes of what it means to be human for what defines humanity perhaps biologically is our physiology but god defines humanity by our spirituality by our nature and the koran says he speaks to the angels and says " when i have finished the formation of adam from clay and breathed into him of my spirit then fall in prostration to him " the angels prostrate not before the human body but before the human soul why because the soul the human soul embodies a piece of the divine breath a piece of the divine soul this is also expressed in biblical vocabulary when we are taught that we were created in the divine image what is the imagery of god the imagery of god is absolute being absolute awareness and knowledge and wisdom and absolute compassion and love and therefore for us to be human -- in the greatest sense of what it means to be human in the most joyful sense of what it means to be human -- means that we too have to be proper stewards of the breath of divinity within us and seek to perfect within ourselves the attribute of being of being alive of beingness ; the attribute of wisdom of consciousness of awareness ; and the attribute of being compassionate and loving beings this is what i understand from my faith tradition and this is what i understand from my studies of other faith traditions and this is the common platform on which we must all stand and when we stand on this platform as such i am convinced that we can make a wonderful world and i believe personally that we 're on the verge and that with the presence and help of people like you here we can bring about the prophecy of isaiah for he foretold of a period when people shall transform their swords into plowshares and will not learn war or make war anymore we have reached a stage in human history that we have no option : we must we must lower our egos control our egos -- whether it is individual ego personal ego family ego national ego -- and let all be for the glorification of the one thank you and god bless you my story actually began when i was four years old and my family moved to a new neighborhood in our hometown of savannah georgia and this was the 1960s when actually all the streets in this neighborhood were named after confederate war generals we lived on robert e. lee boulevard and when i was five my parents gave me an orange schwinn sting-ray bicycle it had a swooping banana seat and those ape hanger handlebars that made the rider look like an orangutan that 's why they were called ape hangers they were actually modeled on hotrod motorcycles of the 1960s which i 'm sure my mom did n't know and one day i was exploring this cul-de-sac hidden away a few streets away and i came back and i wanted to turn around and get back to that street more quickly so i decided to turn around in this big street that intersected our neighborhood and wham ! i was hit by a passing sedan my mangled body flew in one direction my mangled bike flew in the other and i lay on the pavement stretching over that yellow line and one of my neighbors came running over " andy andy how are you doing " she said using the name of my older brother " i 'm bruce " i said and promptly passed out i broke my left femur that day -- it 's the largest bone in your body -- and spent the next two months in a body cast that went from my chin to the tip of my toe to my right knee and a steel bar went from my right knee to my left ankle and for the next 38 years that accident was the only medically interesting thing that ever happened to me in fact i made a living by walking i traveled around the world entered different cultures wrote a series of books about my travels including " walking the bible " i hosted a television show by that name on pbs i was for all the world the " walking guy " until in may 2008 a routine visit to my doctor and a routine blood test produced evidence in the form of an alkaline phosphatase number that something might be wrong with my bones and my doctor on a whim sent me to get a full-body bone scan which showed that there was some growth in my left leg that sent me to an x-ray then to an mri and one afternoon i got a call from my doctor " the tumor in your leg is not consistent with a benign tumor " i stopped walking and it took my mind a second to convert that double negative into a much more horrifying negative i have cancer and to think that the tumor was in the same bone in the same place in my body as the accident 38 years earlier -- it seemed like too much of a coincidence so that afternoon i went back to my house and my three year-old identical twin daughters eden and tybee feiler came running to meet me they 'd just turned three and they were into all things pink and purple in fact we called them pinkalicious and purplicious -- although i must say our favorite nickname occurred on their birthday april 15th when they were born at 6:14 and 6:46 on april 15 2005 our otherwise grim humorless doctor looked at his watch and was like " hmm april 15th -- tax day early filer and late filer " the next day i came to see him i was like " doctor that was a really good joke " and he was like " you 're the writer kid " anyway -- so they had just turned three and they came and they were doing this dance they had just made up where they were twirling faster and faster until they tumbled to the ground laughing with all the glee in the world i crumbled i kept imagining all the walks i might not take with them the art projects i might not mess up the boyfriends i might not scowl at the aisles i might not walk down would they wonder who i was i thought would they yearn for my approval my love my voice a few days later i woke with an idea of how i might give them that voice i would reach out to six men from all parts of my life and ask them to be present in the passages of my daughters ' lives " i believe my girls will have plenty of opportunities in their lives " i wrote these men " they 'll have loving families and welcoming homes but they may not have me they may not have their dad will you help be their dad " and i said to myself i would call this group of men " the council of dads " now as soon as i had this idea i decided i would n't tell my wife okay she 's a very upbeat naturally excited person there 's this idea in this culture -- i do n't have to tell you -- that you sort of " happy " your way through a problem we should focus on the positive my wife as i said she grew up outside of boston she 's got a big smile she 's got a big personality she 's got big hair -- although she told me recently i ca n't say she has big hair because if i say she has big hair people will think she 's from texas and it 's apparently okay to marry a boy from georgia but not to have hair from texas and actually in her defense if she were here right now she would point out that when we got married in georgia there were three questions on the marriage certificate license the third of which was " are you related " i said " look in georgia at least we want to know in arkansas they do n't even ask " what i did n't tell her is if she said " yes " you could jump you do n't need the 30-day waiting period because you do n't need the get-to-know-you session at that point so i was n't going to tell her about this idea but the next day i could n't control myself i told her and she loved the idea but she quickly started rejecting my nominees she was like " well i love him but i would never ask him for advice " so it turned out that starting a council of dads was a very efficient way to find out what my wife really thought of my friends so we decided that we needed a set of rules and we came up with a number and the first one was no family only friends we thought our family would already be there second men only we were trying to fill the dad-space in the girls ' lives and then third sort of a dad for every side we kind of went through my personality and tried to get a dad who represented each different thing so what happened was i wrote a letter to each of these men and rather than send it i decided to read it to them in person linda my wife joked that it was like having six different marriage proposals i sort of friend-married each of these guys and the first of these guys was jeff schumlin now jeff led this trip i took to europe when i graduated from high school in the early 1980s and on that first day we were in this youth hostel in a castle and i snuck out behind and there was a moat a fence and a field of cows and jeff came up beside me and said " so have you ever been cow tipping " i was like " cow tipping he was like " yeah cows sleep standing up so if you approach them from behind down wind you can push them over and they go thud in the mud " so before i had a chance to determine whether this was right or not we had jumped the moat we had climbed the fence we were tiptoeing through the dung and approaching some poor dozing cow so a few weeks after my diagnosis we went up to vermont and i decided to put jeff as the first person in the council of dads and we went to this apple orchard and i read him this letter " will you help be their dad " and i got to the end -- he was crying and i was crying -- and then he looked at me and he said " yes " i was like " yes " i kind of had forgotten there was a question at the heart of my letter and frankly although i keep getting asked this it never occurred to me that anybody would turn me down under the circumstances and then i asked him a question which i ended up asking to all the dads and ended up really encouraging me to write this story down in a book and that was " what 's the one piece of advice you would give to my girls " and jeff 's advice was " be a traveller not a tourist get off the bus seek out what 's different approach the cow " " so it 's 10 years from now " i said " and my daughters are about to take their first trip abroad and i 'm not here what would you tell them " he said " i would approach this journey as a young child might approach a mud puddle you can bend over and look at your reflection in the mirror and maybe run your finger and make a small ripple or you can jump in and thrash around and see what it feels like what it smells like " and as he talked he had that glint in his eye that i first saw back in holland -- the glint that says " let 's go cow tipping " even though we never did tip the cow even though no one tips the cow even though cows do n't sleep standing up he said " i want to see you back here girls at the end of this experience covered in mud " two weeks after my diagnosis a biopsy confirmed i had a seven-inch osteosarcoma in my left femur six hundred americans a year get an osteosarcoma eighty-five percent are under 21 only a hundred adults a year get one of these diseases twenty years ago doctors would have cut off my leg and hoped and there was a 15 percent survival rate and then in the 1980 's they determined that one particular cocktail of chemo could be effective and within weeks i had started that regimen and since we are in a medical room i went through four and a half months of chemo actually i had cisplatin doxorubicin and very high-dose methotrexate and then i had a 15-hour surgery in which my surgeon dr. john healey at memorial sloan-kettering hospital in new york took out my left femur and replaced it with titanium and if you did see the sanjay special you saw these enormous screws that they screwed into my pelvis then he took my fibula from my calf cut it out and then relocated it to my thigh where it now lives and what he actually did was he de-vascularized it from my calf and re-vascularized it in my thigh and then connected it to the good parts of my knee and my hip and then he took out a third of my quadriceps muscle this is a surgery so rare only two human beings have survived it before me and my reward for surviving it was to go back for four more months of chemo it was as we said in my house a lost year because in those opening weeks we all had nightmares and one night i had a nightmare that i was walking through my house sat at my desk and saw photographs of someone else 's children sitting on my desk and i remember a particular one night that when you told that story of -- i do n't know where you are dr. nuland -- of william sloane coffin -- it made me think of it because i was in the hospital after i think it was my fourth round of chemo when my numbers went to zero and i had basically no immune system and they put me in an infectious disease ward at the hospital and anybody who came to see me had to cover themselves in a mask and cover all of the extraneous parts of their body and one night i got a call from my mother-in-law that my daughters at that time three and a half were missing me and feeling my absence and i hung up the phone and i put my face in my hands and i screamed this silent scream and what you said dr. nuland -- i do n't know where you are -- made me think of this today because the thought that came to my mind was that the feeling that i had was like a primal scream and what was so striking -- and one of the messages i want to leave you here with today -- is the experience as i became less and less human -- and at this moment in my life i was probably 30 pounds less than i am right now of course i had no hair and no immune system they were actually putting blood inside my body at that moment i was less and less human i was also at the same time maybe the most human i 've ever been and what was so striking about that time was instead of repulsing people i was actually proving to be a magnet for people people were incredibly drawn when my wife and i had kids we thought it would be all-hands-on-deck instead it was everybody running the other way and when i had cancer we thought it 'd be everybody running the other way instead it was all-hands-on-deck and when people came to me rather than being incredibly turned off by what they saw -- i was like a living ghost -- they were incredibly moved to talk about what was going on in their own lives cancer i found is a passport to intimacy it is an invitation maybe even a mandate to enter the most vital arenas of human life the most sensitive and the most frightening the ones that we never want to go to but when we do go there we feel incredibly transformed when we do and this also happened to my girls as they began to see and we thought maybe became an ounce more compassionate one day my daughter tybee tybee came to me and she said " i have so much love for you in my body daddy i ca n't stop giving you hugs and kisses and when i have no more love left i just drink milk because that 's where love comes from " and one night my daughter eden came to me and as i lifted my leg out of bed she reached for my crutches and handed them to me in fact if i cling to one memory of this year it would be walking down a darkened hallway with five spongy fingers grasping the handle underneath my hand i did n't need the crutch anymore i was walking on air and one of the profound things that happened was this act of actually connecting to all these people and it made me think -- and i 'll just note for the record -- one word that i 've only heard once actually was when we were all doing tony robbins yoga yesterday -- the one word that has not been mentioned in this seminar actually is the word " friend " and yet from everything we 've been talking about -- compliance or addiction or weight loss -- we now know that community is important and yet it 's one thing we do n't actually bring in and there was something incredibly profound about sitting down with my closest friends and telling them what they meant to me and one of the things that i learned is that over time particularly men who used to be non-communicative are becoming more and more communicative and that particularly happened -- there was one in my life -- is this council of dads that linda said what we were talking about it 's like what the moms talk about at school drop-off and no one captures this modern manhood to me more than david black now david is my literary agent he 's about five-foot three and a half on a good day standing fully upright in cowboy boots and on kind of the manly-male front he answers the phone -- i can say this i guess because you 've done it here -- he answers the phone " yo motherfucker " he gives boring speeches about obscure bottles of wine and on his 50th birthday he bought a convertible sports car -- although like a lot of men he 's impatient ; he bought it on his 49th but like a lot of modern men he hugs he bakes he leaves work early to coach little league someone asked me if he cried when i asked him to be in the council of dads i was like " david cries when you invite him to take a walk " but he 's a literary agent which means he 's a broker of dreams in a world where most dreams do n't come true and this is what we wanted him to capture -- what it means to have setbacks and then aspirations and i said " what 's the most valuable thing you can give to a dreamer " and he said " a belief in themselves " " but when i came to see you " i said " i did n't believe in myself i was at a wall " he said " i do n't see the wall " and i 'm telling you the same do n't see the wall you may encounter one from time to time but you 've got to find a way to get over it around it or through it but whatever you do do n't succumb to it do n't give in to the wall my home is not far from the brooklyn bridge and during the year and a half i was on crutches it became a sort of symbol to me so one day near the end of my journey i said " come on girls let 's take a walk across the brooklyn bridge " we set out on crutches i was on crutches my wife was next to me my girls were doing these rockstar poses up ahead and because walking was one of the first things i lost i spent most of that year thinking about this most elemental of human acts walking upright we are told is the threshold of what made us human and yet for the four million years humans have been walking upright the act is essentially unchanged as my physical therapist likes to say " every step is a tragedy waiting to happen " you nearly fall with one leg then you catch yourself with the other and the biggest consequence of walking on crutches -- as i did for a year and a half -- is that you walk slower you hurry you get where you 're going but you get there alone you go slow you get where you 're going but you get there with this community you built along the way at the risk of admission i was never nicer than the year i was on crutches 200 years ago a new type of pedestrian appeared in paris he was called a " flaneur " one who wanders the arcades and it was the custom of those flaneurs to show they were men of leisure by taking turtles for walks and letting the reptile set the pace and i just love this ode to slow moving and it 's become my own motto for my girls take a walk with a turtle behold the world in pause and this idea of pausing may be the single biggest lesson i took from my journey there 's a quote from moses on the side of the liberty bell and it comes from a passage in the book of leviticus that every seven years you should let the land lay fallow and every seven sets of seven years the land gets an extra year of rest during which time all families are reunited and people surrounded with the ones they love that 50th year is called the jubilee year and it 's the origin of that term and though i 'm shy of 50 it captures my own experience my lost year was my jubilee year by laying fallow i planted the seeds for a healthier future and was reunited with the ones i love come the one year anniversary of my journey i went to see my surgeon dr. john healey -- and by the way healey great name for a doctor he 's the president of the international society of limb salvage which is the least euphemistic term i 've ever heard and i said " dr. healey if my daughters come to you one day and say 'what should i learn from my daddy 's story ' what would you tell them " he said " i would tell them what i know and that is everybody dies but not everybody lives i want you to live " i wrote a letter to my girls that appears at the end of my book " the council of dads " and i listed these lessons a few of which you 've heard here today : approach the cow pack your flipflops do n't see the wall live the questions harvest miracles as i looked at this list -- to me it was sort of like a psalm book of living -- i realized we may have done it for our girls but it really changed us and that is the secret of the council of dads is that my wife and i did this in an attempt to help our daughters but it really changed us so i stand here today as you see now walking without crutches or a cane and last week i had my 18-month scans and as you all know anybody with cancer has to get follow-up scans in my case it 's quarterly and all the collective minds in this room i dare say can never find a solution for scan-xiety as i was going there i was wondering what would i say depending on what happened here i got good news that day and i stand here today cancer-free walking without aid and hobbling forward and i just want to mention briefly in passing -- i 'm past my time limit -- but i just want to briefly mention in passing that one of the nice things that can come out of a conference like this is at a similar meeting back in the spring anne wojcicki heard about our story and very quickly -- in a span of three weeks -- put the full resources of 23andme and we announced an initiative in july to get to decode the genome of anybody a living person with a heart tissue bone sarcoma and she told me last night in the three months since we 've done it we 've gotten 300 people who 've contributed to this program and the epidemiologists here will tell you that 's half the number of people who get the disease in one year in the united states so if you go to 23andme or if you go to councilofdads.com you can click on a link and we encourage anybody to join this effort but i 'll just close what i 've been talking about by leaving you with this message : may you find an excuse to reach out to some long-lost pal or to that college roommate or to some person you may have turned away from may you find a mud puddle to jump in someplace or find a way to get over around or through any wall that stands between you and one of your dreams and every now and then find a friend find a turtle and take a long slow walk thank you very much i 'm going to talk about two stories today one is how we need to use market-based pricing to affect demand and use wireless technologies to dramatically reduce our emissions in the transportation sector and the other is that there is an incredible opportunity if we choose the right wireless technologies ; how we can generate a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce c02 in the other sectors i 'm really scared we need to reduce c02 emissions in ten to fifteen years by 80 percent in order to avert catastrophic effects and i am astounded that i 'm standing here to tell you that what are catastrophic effects a three degree centigrade climate change rise that will result in 50 percent species extinction it 's not a movie this is real life and i 'm really worried because when people talk about cars -- which i know something about -- the press and politicians and people in this room are all thinking " let 's use fuel-efficient cars " if we started today 10 years from now at the end of this window of opportunity those fuel-efficient cars will reduce our fossil fuel needs by four percent that is not enough but now i 'll talk about some more pleasant things here are some ways that we can make some dramatic changes so zipcar is a company that i founded seven years ago but it 's an example of something called car sharing what zipcar does is we park cars throughout dense urban areas for members to reserve by the hour and by the day instead of using their own car how does it feel to be a person using a zipcar it means that i pay only for what i need all those hours when a car is sitting idle i 'm not paying for it it means that i can choose a car exactly for that particular trip so here 's a woman that reserved minimia and she had her day i can take a bmw when i 'm seeing clients i can drive my toyota element when i 'm going to go on that surfing trip and the other remarkable thing is it 's i think the highest status of car ownership not only do i have a fleet of cars available to me in seven cities around the world that i can have at my beck and call but heaven forbid i would ever maintain or deal with the repair or have anything to do with it it 's like the car that you always wanted that your mom said that you could n't have i get all the good stuff and none of the bad so what is the social result of this the social result is that today 's zipcar has 100,000 members driving 3,000 cars parked in 3,000 parking spaces instead of driving 12,000 miles a year which is what the average city dweller does they drive 500 miles a year are they happy the company has been doubling in size ever since i founded it or greater people adore the company and it 's better you know they like it so how is it that people went from the 12,000 miles a year to 500 miles it 's because they said " it 's eight to 10 dollars an hour and 65 dollars a day if i 'm going to go buy some ice cream do i really want to spend eight dollars to go buy the ice cream or maybe i 'll do without maybe i would have bought the ice cream when i did some other errand " so people really respond very quickly to it to prices and the last point i want to make is zipcar would never be possible without technology it required that it was completely trivial : that it takes 30 seconds to reserve a car go get it drive it and for me as a service provider i would never be able to provide you a car for an hour if the transaction cost was anything so without these wireless technologies this as a concept could never happen so here 's another example this company is goloco -- i 'm launching it in about three weeks -- and i hope to do for ridesharing what i did for car sharing this will apply to people across all of america today 75 percent of the trips are single-occupancy vehicles yet 12 percent of trips to work are currently carpool and i think that we can apply social networks and online payment systems to completely change how people feel about ridesharing and make that trip much more efficient and so when i think about the future people will be thinking that sharing the ride with someone is this incredibly great social event out of their day you know how did you get to ted you went with other tedsters how fabulous why would you ever want to go by yourself in your own car how did you go food shopping you went with your neighbor what a great social time you know it 's going to really transform how we feel about travel and it will also i think enhance our freedom of mobility where can i go today and who can i do it with those are the types of things that you will look at and feel and the social benefits : the rate of single-occupancy vehicles is i told you 75 percent ; i think we can get that down to 50 percent the demand for parking of course is down congestion and the co2 emissions one last piece about this of course is that it 's enabled by wireless technologies and it 's the cost of driving that 's making people want to be able to do this the average american spends 19 percent of their income on their car and there 's a pressure for them to reduce that cost yet they have no outlet today so the last example of this is congestion pricing very famously done in london it 's when you charge a premium for people to drive on congested roads in london the day they turned the congestion pricing on there was a 25 percent decrease in congestion overnight and that 's persisted for the four years in which they 've been doing congestion pricing and again do people like the outcome ken livingstone was reelected so again we can see that price plays an enormous role in people 's willingness to reduce their driving behavior we 've tripled the miles that we drive since 1970 and doubled them since 1982 there 's a huge slack in that system ; with the right pricing we can undo that congestion pricing is being discussed in every major city around the world and is again wirelessly enabled you were n't going to put tollbooths around the city of london and open and shut those gates and what congestion pricing is is that it 's a technology trial and a psychological trial for something called road pricing and road pricing is where we 're all going to have to go because today we pay for our maintenance and wear and tear on our cars with gas taxes and as we get our cars more fuel-efficient that 's going to be reducing the amount of revenue that you get off of those gas taxes so we need to charge people by the mile that they drive whatever happens with congestion pricing and those technologies will be happening with road pricing why do we travel too much car travel is underpriced and therefore we over-consumed we need to put this better market feedback and if we have it you 'll decide how many miles to drive what mode of travel where to live and work and wireless technologies make this real-time loop possible so i want to move now to the second part of my story which is : when are we going to start doing this congestion pricing road pricing is coming when are we going to do it are we going to wait 10 to 15 years for this to happen or are we going to finally have this political will to make it happen in the next two years because i 'm going to say that is going to be the tool that 's going to turn our usage overnight and what kind of wireless technology are we going to use this is my big vision there is a tool that can help us bridge the digital divide respond to emergencies get traffic moving provide a new engine for economic growth and dramatically reduce co2 emissions in every sector and this is a moment from " the graduate " do you remember this moment you guys are going to be the handsome young guy and i 'm going to be the wise businessman " i want to say one word to you just one word " " yes sir " " are you listening " " yes i am " " ad-hoc peer-to-peer self-configuring wireless networks " these are also called mesh networks and in a mesh every device contributes to and expands the network and i think you might have heard a little bit about it before i 'm going to give you some examples you 'll be hearing later today from alan kay these laptops when a child opens them up they communicate with every single child in the classroom within that school within that village and what is the cost of that communication system zero dollars a month here 's another example : in new orleans video cameras were mesh-enabled so that they could monitor crime in the downtown french quarter when the hurricane happened the only communication system standing was the mesh network volunteers flew in added a whole bunch of devices and for the next 12 months mesh networks were the only wireless that was happening in new orleans another example is in portsmouth u.k they mesh-enabled 300 buses and they speak to these smart terminals you can look at the terminal and be able to see precisely where your bus is on the street and when it 's coming and you can buy your tickets in real time again all mesh-enabled monthly communication cost : zero so the beauty of mesh networks : you can have these very low-cost devices zero ongoing communication costs highly scalable ; you can just keep adding them and as in katrina you can keep subtracting them -- as long as there 's some we can still communicate they 're resilient ; their redundancy is built into this fabulous decentralized design what are the incredible weaknesses there is n't anybody in washington lobbying to make it happen -- or in those municipalities to build out their cities with these wireless networks -- because there 's zero ongoing communications cost so the examples that i gave you are these islands of mesh networks and networks are interesting only as they are big how do we create a big network are you guys ready again -- " the graduate " this time you will still play the handsome young thing but i 'll be the sexy woman " where did you do it " " in his car " so you know when you stick this idea â€¦ where would we expect me robin chase to be thinking is imagine if we put a mesh-network device in every single car across america we could have a coast-to-coast free wireless communication system i guess i just want you to think about that and why is this going to happen because we 're going to do congestion pricing we are going to do road tolls gas taxes are going to become road pricing these things are going to happen what 's the wireless technology we 're going to use maybe we should use a good one when are we going to do it maybe we should n't wait for the 10 or 15 years for this to happen we should pull it forward so i 'd like us to launch the wireless internet interstate wireless mesh system and require that this network be accessible to everyone with open standards right now in the transportation sector we 're creating these wireless devices -- i guess you guys might have fast pass here or easy lane -- that are single-purpose devices in these closed networks what is the point we 're transferring just a few little data bits when we 're doing road controlling road pricing we have this incredible excess capacity so we can provide the lowest-cost means of going wireless coast-to-coast we can have resilient nationwide communication systems we have a new tool for creating efficiencies in all sectors imagine what happens when the cost of getting information from anywhere to anywhere is close to zero what you can do with that tool : we can create an economic engine information should be free and access to information should be free and we should be charging people for carbon i think this is a more powerful tool than the interstate highway act and i think this is as important and world changing to our economy as electrification and if i had my druthers we would have an open-source version in addition to open standards and this open-source version means that it could be -- if we did a brilliant job of it -- it could be used around the world very quickly so going back to one of my earlier thoughts imagine if every one of these buses in lagos was part of the mesh network when i went this morning to larry brilliant 's tedtalk prize -- his fabulous networks -- imagine if there was an open-source mesh communications device that can be put into those networks to make all that happen and we can be doing it if we could just get over the fact that this little slice of things is going to be for free we could make billions of dollars on top of it but this one particular slice of communications needs to be open source so let 's take control of this nightmare : implement a gas tax immediately ; transition across the nation to road-tolling with this wireless mesh ; require that the mesh be open to all with open standards ; and of course use mesh networks thank you kurt andersen : like many architects david is a hog for the limelight but is sufficiently reticent -- or at least pretends to be -- that he asked me to question him rather than speaking in fact what we 're going to talk about i think is in fact a subject that is probably better served by a conversation than an address and i guess we have a bit of news clip to precede dan rather : since the september 11th attack on the world trade center many people have flocked to downtown new york to see and pay respects at what amounts to the 16-acre burial ground now as cbs 's jim axelrod reports they 're putting the finishing touches on a new way for people to visit and view the scene jim axelrod : forget the empire state building or the statue of liberty there 's a new place in new york where the crowds are thickest -- ground zero tourist : i 've taken my step-daughter here from indianapolis this was -- out of all the tourist sites in new york city -- this was her number-one pick ja : thousands now line up on lower broadway tourist : i 've been wanting to come down here since this happened ja : even on the coldest winter days to honor and remember tourist : it 's reality it 's us it happened here this is ours ja : so many in fact that seeing has become a bit of a problem tourist : i think that people are very frustrated that they 're not able to get closer to see what 's going on ja : but that is about to change in record time a team of architects and construction workers designed and built a viewing platform to ease the frustration and bring people closer man : they 'll get an incredible panorama and understand i think more completely the sheer totality of the destruction of the place ja : if you think about it ground zero is unlike most any other tourist site in america unlike the grand canyon or the washington monument people come here to see what 's no longer there david rockwell : the first experience people will have here when they see this is not as a construction site but as this incredibly moving burial ground ja : the walls are bare by design so people can fill them with their own memorials the way they already have along the current perimeter tourist : from our hearts it affected us just as much ja : the ramps are made of simple material -- the kind of plywood you see at construction sites -- which is really the whole point in the face of america 's worst destruction people are building again jim axelrod cbs news new york ka : this is not an obvious subject to be in the sensuality segment but certainly david you are known as -- i know a phrase you hate -- an entertainment architect your work is highly sensual even hedonistic dr : i like that word ka : it 's about pleasure -- casinos and hotels and restaurants how did the shock that all of us -- and especially all of us in new york -- felt on the 11th of september transmute into your desire to do this thing dr : well the truth of the matter is post-september 11th i felt myself in the role originally -- first of all as someone who lives in tribeca and whose neighborhood was devastated and as someone who works less than a mile from there -- that i was in the role of forcing 100 people who work with me in my firm to continue to have the same level of enthusiasm about creating the places we had been creating in fact we 're finishing a book which is called " pleasure " which is about sensual pleasure in spaces but i 've got to tell you -- it became impossible to do that we were really paralyzed and i found myself the friday after september 11th -- two days afterwards -- literally unable to motivate anyone to do anything we gave the office a few days off and in discussing this with other architects we had seen people saying in the press that they should rebuild the towers as they were -- they should rebuild them 50 stories taller and i thought it was astonishing to speculate as if this were a competition on something that was such a fresh wound and i had a series of discussions -- first with rick scofidio and liz diller who collaborated with us on this and several other people -- and really felt like we had to find relevance in doing something and that as people who create places the ultimate way to help was n't to pontificate or to make up scenarios but to help right now so we tried to come up with a way as a group to have a kind of design swat team and that was the mission that we came up with ka : were you conscious of suddenly -- as a designer whose work is all about fulfilling wants -- suddenly fulfilling needs dr : well what i was aware of was there was this overwhelming need to act now and we were asked to participate in a few projects before this there was a school ps 234 that had been evacuated down at ground zero they moved to an abandoned school we took about 20 or 30 architects and designers and artists and over four days -- it was like this urban barn-raising -- to renovate it and everyone wanted to help it was just extraordinary tom otterness contributed maira kalman contributed and it became this cathartic experience for us ka : and that was done effectively by october 8 or something dr : yeah ka : obviously what you faced in trying to do something as substantial as this project -- and this is only one of four that you 've designed to surround the site -- you must have run up against the incredibly byzantine entrenched bureaucracy and powers that be in new york real estate and new york politics dr : well it 's a funny thing we finished ps 234 and had dinner with a small group i was actually asked to be a committee chair on an aia committee to rebuild and i sat in on several meetings and there were the most circuitous grand plans that had to do with long-term infrastructure and rebuilding the entire city and the fact is that there were immediate wounds and needs that needed to be filled and there was talk about inclusion and wanting it to be an inclusive process and it was n't an inclusive group so we said what is -- ka : it was not an inclusive group dr : it was not an inclusive group it was predominantly a white rich corporate group that was not representative of the city ka : shocking dr : yeah surprising so rick and liz and kevin and i came up with the idea the city actually approached us we first approached the city about pier 94 we saw how ps 234 worked the families -- the victims of the families -- were going to this pier that was incredibly dehumanizing ka : on the hudson river dr : yeah and the city actually -- through tim zagat initially and then through christyne nicholas then we got to giuliani -- said " you know we do n't want to do anything with pier 94 right now but we have an observation platform for the families down at ground zero that we 'd like to be a more dignified experience for the families and a way to protect it from the weather " so i went down there with rick and liz and kevin and i 've got to say it was the most moving experience of my life it was devastating to see the simple plywood platform with a rail around it where the families of the victims had left notes to them and there was no mediation between us and the experience there was no filter and i remembered on september 11th on 14th street the roof of our building -- we can see the world trade towers prominently -- and i saw the first building collapse from a conference room on the eighth floor on a tv that we had set up and then everyone was up on the roof so i ran up there and it was amazing how much harder it was to believe in real life than it was on tv there was something about the comfort of the filter and how much information was between us and the experience so seeing this in a very simple dignified way was a very powerful experience so we went back to the city and said we 're not particularly interested in the upgrade of this as a vip platform but we 've spent some time down there at the same time the city had this need they were looking for a solution to deal with 30 or 40 thousand people a day who were going down there that had nowhere to go and there was no way to deal with the traffic around the site so dealing with it is just an immediate master plan there was a way -- there had to be a way -- to get people to move around the site ka : but then you 've got to figure out a way -- we will skip over the insanely tedious process of getting permits and getting everybody on board -- but simply funding this thing it looks like a fairly simple thing but this was a half a million dollar project dr : well we knew that if it was n't privately funded it was n't going to happen and we also frankly knew that if it did n't happen by the end of the giuliani administration then everyone who we were dealing with at the dot and the police department and all of the -- we were meeting with 20 or 30 people with the city at a time and it was set up by the office of emergency management this incredible act on their part because they really wanted this and they sensed that this needed to happen ka : and there was therefore this ticking clock because giuliani was obviously out three months after that dr : yeah so the first thing we had to do was find a way to get this -- we had to work with the families of the victims through the city to make sure that they knew this was happening because this did n't want to be a surprise and we also had to be as under the radar screen as we could be in new york because the key was not raising a lot of objection and sort of working as quietly as possible we came up with the idea of setting up a foundation mainly because when we found a contractor who would build this he would not agree to do this even if we would pay him the money there needed to be a foundation in place so we came up with a foundation and actually what happened was one major developer in new york -- ka : who shall remain nameless i guess dr : yeah his initials are js and he owns rockefeller center if that helps anyone -- volunteered to help and we met with him the prices from the contractors were between five to 700,000 dollars and atlantic-heydt who 's the largest scaffolding contractor in the country volunteered to do it at cost so this developer said " you know what we 'll underwrite the entire expense " and we said " that 's incredible ! " and i think this was the 21st and we knew this had to be built and up by the 28th and we had to start construction the next day we had a meeting that evening with his contractor of choice and the contractor showed up with the drawings of the platform about half the size that we had drawn it ka : sort of like the spinal tap scene where you get the tiny little stonehenge i guess dr : in fact it was as if this was going to be window-washing scaffolding there was no sense of the fact that this is next to saint paul -- and a place to reflect and remember and i 've got to say that we spent a lot of time in putting this together watching the crowds that gathered at saint paul -- which is just to the right -- and moving around the site and i live down there so we spent a lot of time looking at the need and i think people were amazed at two things -- i think they were amazed at the destruction but i think there was a sense of disbelief about the heroics of new yorkers that i found very moving just the sort of everyday heroics of new yorkers so we were in this meeting and the contractor literally said " i 'm going to lock the door because this developer will not agree to have you leave till you 've signed off on this " and we said " well this is half the size it does n't have any of the design features that have been agreed upon by everyone -- everyone in the city we 'd have to go back to the beginning to do this " and i convinced him that we should leave the room with the agreement to build it as designed the next day i got an email from the developer saying that he was withdrawing all funding so we did n't know what to do but we decided to cast a very wide net we emailed out letters to as many people as we could -- several people in the audience here -- who were very helpful ka : there was no thought of abandoning ship at that point dr : no in fact i told the contractor to go ahead he had already ordered materials based on my go-ahead we knew that one way or another this was going to happen and we just felt it had to happen ka : you were funding it yourself and with contributions and this foundation richard i think very correctly made the point at the beginning -- before all the chair designers came out -- about the history of chair designers imposing aesthetic solutions on this kind of universal banal common problem of sitting it seems to me with this that it was the opposite of that this was an unprecedented singular design problem dr : well here 's the issue : we knew that this was not in the sense of -- we think about the site and think about the need for a memorial it was important that this not be categorized as a memorial that this was a place for people to reflect to remember -- a kind of quiet place so it led us to using design solutions that created as few filters between the viewer -- as we said about the families ' platform -- and the experience as possible it 's all incredibly humble material it 's scaffolding and plywood and it allows -- by sort of the procession of the movement up by saint paul 's and down the other side -- it gives you about 300 feet to go up 13 feet from the ground to where you get the 360 degree view but the design was driven by a need to be quick cheap safe respectful flexible one of the other things is this is designed to be moveable because when we looked at the four platforms around the site one of which is an upgrade of the families ' platform we knew that these had to be moveable to respond to changing conditions and the changing definition of what ground zero is ka : your work -- i mean we 've talked about this before -- a lot of your work i think is informed by your belief in or your focus on the temporariness of all things and the evanescence of things and a kind of " eat drink and be merry for tomorrow we die " sort of sense of existence this is clearly not a work for the ages you know a couple of years this thing is n't going to be here did that require as an architect a new way of thinking about what you were doing to think of it as this purely temporary installation dr : no i do n't think so i think this is obviously substantially different from anything we 'd ever thought about doing before just by the nature of it where it overlaps with thoughts about our work in general is number one -- the notion of collaboration as a sort of way to get things done and kevin kennon rick scofidio liz diller and all the people within the city -- norman lear who i spoke to four hours before our deadline for funding offered to give us a bridge loan to help us get through it so the notion of collaboration -- i think this reinforces how important that is and in terms of the temporary nature of it our goal was not to create something that would be there longer than it needed to be i think what we were most interested in was promoting a kind of dialogue that we felt may not have been happening enough in this city about what 's really happening there and a day or two before it opened was giuliani 's farewell address where he proposed the idea of all of ground zero being a memorial which was very controversial but it resonated with a lot of people and i think regardless of what the position is about how this sacred piece of land is to be used having it come out of actually seeing it in a real encounter i think makes it a more powerful dialogue and that 's what we were interested in so that very much is in the realm of things i 've been interested in before ka : it seems to me among other things a lovely piece of civic infrastructure it enables that conversation to get serious and six months after the fact -- and only a few months away from the site being cleaned -- we are very quickly now getting to the point where those conversations about what should go there are getting serious do you have -- having been as physically involved in the site as you have been doing this project -- have any ideas about what should or should n't be done dr : well i think one thing that should n't be done is evaluate -- i think right now the discussion is a very closed discussion on the master plan the protetch gallery recently had a show on ideas for buildings which had some sort of inventive ideas of buildings ka : but it had some really terrible ideas dr : and it also felt a little bit like a kind of competition of ideas where i think the focus of ideas should be on master planning and uses and i think there should be a broader -- which there 's starting to be -- the dialogue is really opening up to what does this site really want to be and i truly believe until the issue of memorial is sorted out that it 's going to be very hard to have an intelligent discussion there 's a few discussions right now that i think are very positive about depressing the west side highway and connecting this over so that there 's one uninterrupted piece of land ka : well i think that 's interesting and it gets to another issue that was probably inappropriate to discuss six months ago but perhaps is n't now which is not many of us love the world trade center as a piece of architecture as what it had done to this city and that huge plaza is this an opportunity is the silver lining -- a silver lining here -- to rebuild some more traditional city grid or not dr : i think there 's a real opportunity to engage in a discussion of why we live in cities and why do we live in places where such dissimilar people collide up against us each day i do n't think it has much to do with 50 or 60 or 70 or 80 thousand new office spaces regardless of what the number is so yeah i think there is a chance to re-look at how we think about cities and in fact there 's a proposal on the table now for building number seven ka : which was the building just north of the towers dr : right which the towers fell into and the reason that 's been held up is essentially by community outrage that they 're not re-opening the street to connect that back to the rest of the city i think a public dialogue -- i think you know i 'd like to see an international competition and a call for ideas for uses ka : whether it 's arts whether it 's housing whether it 's what amount of shopping dr : right and we 're looking for other things this small foundation we put together is looking for other ways to help including taking a small piece adjacent to the site and inviting 10 architects who currently do n't have a voice in new york to do artist housing and find other ways to encourage the discussion to be against sort of monolithic single solutions and more about a multiplicity of things ka : before we end i know you have a piece of digital video of the experience of being on this platform dr : john kamen -- who 's here actually -- put together a two and a half minute piece that shows the platform in use so i thought that would be good to end with dr : we 're looking from fulton street west one of the tricky issues we had with the giuliani administration was i had forgotten how anti-graffiti he was and essentially our structure was designed to be written on ka : as you say it 's not a memorial but were you conscious of memorials the vietnam memorial those kinds of forms dr : we certainly did as much research as we could and we were conscious of other memorials and also the complexity and length of time they really take to do it 's 350 people on the committee for oklahoma city which is why we thought of this as a sort of ad-hoc spontaneous solution that expanded on union square and the places that were ad-hoc memorials in the city already the scaffolding you can see built up over the street is de-mountable what 's interesting now is the nature of the site has totally changed so that what you 're aware of is not just the destruction of the buildings in ground zero but all of the buildings around it -- and the scars on the building around it which are enormous this shows saint paul 's on the left ka : i just want to thank you on behalf of new yorkers for making this happen and getting this done but the kind of virtually instantaneous nature of its erection and its being there almost before you could believe that a response of this magnitude could be accomplished is part of its extraordinary -- i do n't know if beauty is the word -- but presence dr : it was an honor to do and we were thrilled to be able to show it here my favorite topic is shortcuts the master of shortcuts -- it 's of course nature but i will demonstrate different ways to get rid of difficulties and go to the point to find an answer probably much quicker than arthur did so first we violate the common sense the logic all of you if you hold your hand like this 90 degrees -- all of you not you all of you right palm up if you do this the common the logic says you must turn the wrist do you agree good but i will first teach you a method how you can do it without moving the wrist and then the shortcut you can do it immediately right hold the hand like this palm up do n't move the wrist the wrist is -- i does n't speak very many but i do the best what i are right-molded you say with iron that was a joke actually and i -- ok hold the hand palm up do this do n't move the wrist over the heart do n't move the wrist forward do n't move the wrist up do n't move the wrist over the heart do n't move the wrist and forward yeah now -- -- logic logically you have got to this position from this without moving the wrist now the shortcut but it was six moves now with one move i start here palm down you can follow and then look at me yeah ! one move ok so that was the warming up now i need an assistant i talked to a nice girl before zoe she has left no ! a big hand good nice and you can sit over there one item here was water right and i will give my tribute to water i think it 's enough with water for me the other guys can talk about -- cheers beer has about -- there 's a lot of water in beer so now i will demonstrate different ways of memorizing control cards and so on and i think i 'll take off this one i work with a special method to do it quick i work with precision -- oh sorry -- control and a very powerful â€¦ memory system right so if -- i have studied the poker i like to gamble officially i do n't gamble but â€¦ so if we are -- if we have five person and i will do a five-handed poker game now i will interact so a different person all the time so not the same person can answer so we have an agreement which one shall have a good poker hand which number one two three four or five lennart green : three -- good and here i had a mat here to make it a little -- the critical moment is -- sorry if a card shark gathers the cards together immediately when he -- before he deals the card now so i think number three i have arranged them in a full house with queens and -- it 's ok -- queens and tens that 's a challenge i like this i will explain later one two three four five i start with three queens so here you see the contrast when i treat the cards and two tens yeah thank you but also the other hand is good if all the other guys have good hands too so these guys have actually a stronger hand -- three aces and two kings this guy beats them with four of a kind or deuce -- deuce no reaction that with even -- ok and this these look in order i 'm probably -- hopefully -- yeah three four five six seven and â€¦ but of course i will have the winning hand ten jack queen king ace yeah so good so the hand that looks so good from the beginning number three at the end was actually the lowest hand such life right so please mix them now if you are interested i will demonstrate some underground techniques yes i work with kind of estimation shuffle tracking -- ah good impressive thank you so first the first term is estimation here i can estimate exactly how many cards are put between my royal flush of course i can count the cards but this is much quicker right you agree so here i have actually -- i know exactly where the cards are so here i can make a bet and this is actually one of the points where i get my money so here : 10 jack queen king ace ok next is a term -- i do it quick i call this stealing so here i think i know about where the cards are i will spread the cards and you 'll say stop when i point to them right point say stop zoe : stop lg : here -- you see some are missing and that 's the stealing cards which i did ok now another term called shuffle tracking shuffle tracking means i keep track of the cards even if another person shuffles this is a little risky so -- because if you look now i can still see it you agree but if you square -- square and shuffle and then a cut so here to follow my cards i must look at the shuffle from the begin -- ah we are started together it 's ok it 's ok come to -- no no no no i 'm joking yeah any style -- yeah good here i have to calculate but actually i do n't like to calculate i work direct with the right brain if you pass the left brain you have to take care of logic and common sense direct in the right brain that 's much better and so -- -- arthur benjamin did a little of the same thing and if you work with in the right atmosphere with humor you have -- that 's the password to the cosmic bank of knowledge where you can find any solution of any problem ok. now i drop the cards and you say stop anyway right not at the last card zoe : stop lg : yeah when i 'm sober i do this much quicker but we will check ah not in order it -- that was a mistake no i 'm kidding no now and then i put in a mistake just to emphasize how difficult it is right yeah last night i forgot that that was a mistake but now i 'm glad i remember it so this deck is bought here sorry i have a little pad to make it a little softer this deck is bought here in america it 's called " bicycle " and this deck is very flexible but not so many people know if you check if you press at the right spots you see how thin and flexible this deck is right now you can carry this in your wallet so â€¦ you do n't see it make no reaction so but here and -- is the camera getting too much no yeah lg : pardon but then when we will have it back you do this but not too much then you have to push it down again here please if you push these heaps -- everyone see -- push them together so they are really interlaced right yeah good perfect just push them through good thank you and then i will demonstrate a thing from russian satellite stealen -- stolen probably copied from america but we will see here -- shortcuts i talk about shortcuts now i go very quick through the deck and try to find some pattern the new chaos theory is already old right but you know i think you are familiar with fractals -- the mandelbrot spirals and all these things and it 's much easier to memorize cards in a pattern way and not concentrate if you concentrate and calculate then you go to -- then it 's the left brain but if you just look and talk in another language â€¦ yeah great i think i have it so now different persons older tap please name any card anyone lg : jack of spades jack of spades i think jack of spades is number 12 from the top one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 yes right so -- oh jack of spades you said spades lg : ah my fault do n't applaud this was clubs so jack of spades i think â€¦ 23 -- 24 sorry 24 one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 -- ah 25 yes it 's the last now i do it quicker better ok. another person oh i forgot i should n't shuffle but i think -- -- actually my technique is to peek all the time when i lift the heap i peek you see yeah perfect three four five six then i calculate -- yeah good another person another card lg : seven of diamonds perfect my favorite yeah seven so i will do it quick very quick but in slow motion so you can follow seven of lg : diamonds good i start here good thank you the thing i did -- i peeked i know where the card were then i chose it so another person another card another person lg : pardon lg : ten of diamonds yeah i think i do it the same way i like to so i know where it is ten of diamonds but now i do it the regular speed right ten of diamonds good maybe you will cut lift excellent so thank you another person another card lg : pardon lg : five of clubs it 's not the same person even if it 's the same spot we can take some over there later so now i will drop the cards and you 'll say stop anywhere got it five of clubs not the last yes that 's difficult to find a card here we do it again the person who said five of clubs say stop when the cards are in the air right lg : very good ok ok i had to use a little force there i think we save five of clubs and now a card with a contrast of five of clubs lg : queen of hearts yeah excellent i love that card here i will do the most difficult thing for example you are sitting in las vegas and you 're betting and you let the other guys peek this card by mistake feel it 's just the regular one card and now when i lift this card it shall be your card what was your card lg : queen of queen of hearts so that 's a tough challenge right so here i grab -- you know this five of clubs â€¦ and queen of hearts yes ! this is a tough one because here i must take advantage of -- i switch it with the five of clubs so now a false count which card shall i use queen or five zoe : the queen lg : queen yes so i use the queen and here 's five of clubs the false count -- and the number one two three four five six seven eight -- you say the same card all the time eight nine 10 this is a kind of optical deal right when i put one card at a table -- look it 's not one card it 's -- look it 's a bunch of cards that gives this impression yeah now some hard stuff i think we keep the queen here yes now to the satellites things this -- oh sorry do n't look at the beam my fault this is high-frequency laser and it 's enough with a fraction of a second to destroy the retina completely right sorry my -- i should have mentioned that yeah but you can relax because it takes half an hour before it works so you have plenty of time to see my whole performance now i put the laser here and -- now when i deal the cards in the laser i know where they are but -- yes did the camera got it no they did n't what happened lg : ok i 'll take another group do the cameras see the cards now no lg : but you see the hand ah good good good but now so now that was the reason right you see the cards yes yeah good now -- -- one guy laughed so now to find the queen do it this way : take back the other one take back the queen yeah interesting but a little dangerous i liked it now a little more difficult name -- anyone name please any suit lg : spades spades good so here here i have to peek lots of cards i think there are lots of -- i do n't know how many -- but 10 15 spades in a deck at least right so every time i lift the heap i peek right then i arrange them so i can get them quick perfect excellent so i start with the ace -- yeah ace ah yeah -- spades same mistake as before right so -- i arrange the spades -- the clubs i try to do this right here first i take the spades you see i do n't work with prestige so always do mistakes it does n't matter to me and now and then i get some extra sympathy points right one two three four -- yes the camera got it five six seven eight -- ah -- nine 10 the jack jack of spades queen of -- i like that laugh yeah ! good queen wait wait wait -- please take any card grab any one quick quick good and we switch this to the king ace of diamonds and now look ace of diamonds will guide so i find â€¦ king of spades there was the place and here is king of spades correct yeah ok now a little more difficult thing maybe you think i have the cards in order already so you help me to shuffle again another suit please lg : pardon lg : it was after the blindfold i like this guy yeah ok. that should be my end effect but ok armani -- who said armani you i drop the cards and you -- which size which size it 's a piece of cake i like challenges which size lg : extra large ok say stop lg : yeah armani ok ah this is tough ok a suit i had clubs before spades another suit lg : diamonds perfect so in this case i try to locate diamonds i look at the cards and ok we try yeah you help me if i drop the card face up like this you reverse it zoe : ok lg : ok now do with both hands and quick yes good good i think we have it now yeah good good so here diamonds hearts -- no diamonds good good stop do you see the pattern no now yes yes ok i work with pattern oh sorry i dropped one maybe it 's important -- yeah -- nine of diamonds ok so now -- i always ask why do i put myself in this position i have to figure out so many outs when i miss some cards but i love it so now i will do it i will try to find the diamonds but i will do it the hard way it 's too easy to do it right away right i think i will do it â€¦ blindfolded at this distance it works immediately aargh ! duct tape i look -- shake the cards so i do n't go ahead yeah good i like the empathy empathy but it was -- did you hear it was women 's voice hear the guy -- yeah more more more yeah good yeah you can take the nostril too because some guys think -- -- some guys think i can peek through the nostril so do more go go right good satisfied looks good like batman ow ! no with dignity and elegance right but i like her yeah i said be a little tough and it was ok. one more the last ok all right now you must agree that i 'm -- i must rely on other senses right i work with vibration so what was the card diamonds ah i memorized hearts so now i have to improvise again maybe i 'll stand up half diamonds -- i 'll start with ace of diamonds just kidding warming up -- king of hearts and i give you a diamonds so they -- so you put them here in a nice row right and you can see yeah good ace of diamonds yes zoe : yeah lg : good good two -- -- thank you i never ever miss two this is interesting always i 've found two but the wrong color spades sorry and the deck is a gift to you after so let the skepticals here in this examine them right remind me it 's a gift two -- and it was two of spades right sorry two of diamonds i 'll do it quick now three -- three of diamonds yes ! four -- i like challenges yes yeah good chris anderson : you 're peeking lg : pardon ca : you 're peeking you just got to -- this is a request from the lady in the back okay try that lg : yeah also listen ok now this is maybe a little tough we will try yes good ok so how many cards five zoe : four lg : four is five the next card zoe : five of diamonds yeah lg : it 's not here zoe : it 's not there lg : oh so here all the cards are face down -- you agree lg : yes you see that in the screen and this is face up and it 's not at the bottom here so next card will be -- was it five zoe : five lg : yeah -- i will reverse it face up here yes zoe : yeah lg : six -- six with the thumb seven yeah i do this i know where it is because i peeked before and then i do this right eight if -- and then nine right yeah yesterday -- the day before yesterday i was in vegas and i used this actually nine yeah correct no yes ! ah good good ten -- once again i love this jonny wayne move yeah jack -- you [ unclear ] with jack jack of diamonds correct lg : yes and queen ! queen with misdirection misdirection yeah and then king after exactly five seconds yeah five five seconds one two three four -- mmm ! check it yes ca : king of diamonds lg : ah ! good oh touch me feel -- ah ah you know ! ca : ladies and gentlemen lennart green ! lg : okay thank you my work is play and i play when i design i even looked it up in the dictionary to make sure that i actually do that and the definition of play number one was engaging in a childlike activity or endeavor and number two was gambling and i realize i do both when i 'm designing i 'm both a kid and i 'm gambling all the time and i think that if you 're not there 's probably something inherently wrong if you 're a designer but the serious part is what threw me and i could n't quite get a handle on it until i remembered an essay and it 's an essay i read 30 years ago it was written by russell baker who used to write an " observer " column in the new york times he 's a wonderful humorist and i 'm going to read you this essay or an excerpt from it because it really hit home for me here is a letter of friendly advice be serious it says what it means of course is be solemn being solemn is easy being serious is hard children almost always begin by being serious which is what makes them so entertaining when compared with adults as a class adults on the whole are solemn in politics the rare candidate who is serious like adlai stevenson is easily overwhelmed by one who is solemn like eisenhower that 's because it is hard for most people to recognize seriousness which is rare but more comfortable to endorse solemnity which is commonplace jogging which is commonplace and widely accepted as good for you is solemn poker is serious washington d.c. is solemn new york is serious going to educational conferences to tell you anything about the future is solemn taking a long walk by yourself during which you devise a foolproof scheme for robbing tiffany 's is serious now when i apply russell baker 's definition of solemnity or seriousness to design it does n't necessarily make any particular point about quality solemn design is often important and very effective design solemn design is also socially correct and is accepted by appropriate audiences it 's what right-thinking designers and all the clients are striving for serious design serious play is something else for one thing it often happens spontaneously intuitively accidentally or incidentally it can be achieved out of innocence or arrogance or out of selfishness sometimes out of carelessness but mostly it 's achieved through all those kind of crazy parts of human behavior that do n't really make any sense serious design is imperfect it 's filled with the kind of craft laws that come from something being the first of its kind serious design is also -- often -- quite unsuccessful from the solemn point of view that 's because the art of serious play is about invention change rebellion -- not perfection perfection happens during solemn play now i always saw design careers like surreal staircases if you look at the staircase you 'll see that in your 20s the risers are very high and the steps are very short and you make huge discoveries you sort of leap up very quickly in your youth that 's because you do n't know anything and you have a lot to learn and so that anything you do is a learning experience and you 're just jumping right up there as you get older the risers get shallower and the steps get wider and you start moving along at a slower pace because you 're making fewer discoveries and as you get older and more decrepit you sort of inch along on this sort of depressing long staircase leading you into oblivion i find it 's actually getting really hard to be serious i 'm hired to be solemn but i find more and more that i 'm solemn when i do n't have to be and in my 35 years of working experience i think i was really serious four times and i 'm going to show them to you now because they came out of very specific conditions it 's great to be a kid now when i was in my early 20s i worked in the record business designing record covers for cbs records and i had no idea what a great job i had i thought everybody had a job like that and what -- the way i looked at design and the way i looked at the world was what was going on around me and the things that came at the time i walked into design were the enemy i really really really hated the typeface helvetica i thought the typeface helvetica was the cleanest most boring most fascistic really repressive typeface and i hated everything that was designed in helvetica and when i was in my college days this was the sort of design that was fashionable and popular this is actually quite a lovely book jacket by rudy de harak but i just hated it because it was designed with helvetica and i made parodies about it i just thought it was you know completely boring so -- so my goal in life was to do stuff that was n't made out of helvetica and to do stuff that was n't made out of helvetica was actually kind of hard because you had to find it and there were n't a lot of books about the history of design in the early 70s there were n't -- there was n't a plethora of design publishing you actually had to go to antique stores you had to go to europe you had to go places and find the stuff and what i responded to was you know art nouveau or deco or victorian typography or things that were just completely not helvetica and i taught myself design this way and this was sort of my early years and i used these things in really goofy ways on record covers and in my design i was n't educated i just sort of put these things together i mixed up victorian designs with pop and i mixed up art nouveau with something else and i made these very lush very elaborate record covers not because i was being a post-modernist or a historicist -- because i did n't know what those things were i just hated helvetica and that kind of passion drove me into very serious play a kind of play i could never do now because i 'm too well-educated and there 's something wonderful about that form of youth where you can let yourself grow and play and be really a brat and then accomplish things by the end of the '70s actually the stuff became known i mean these covers appeared all over the world and they started winning awards and people knew them and i was suddenly a post-modernist and i began a career as -- in my own business and first i was praised for it then criticized for it but the fact of the matter was i had become solemn i did n't do what i think was a piece of serious work again for about 14 years i spent most of the '80s being quite solemn turning out these sorts of designs that i was expected to do because that 's who i was and i was living in this cycle of going from serious to solemn to hackneyed to dead and getting rediscovered all over again so here was the second condition for which i think i accomplished some serious play there 's a paul newman movie that i love called " the verdict " i do n't know how many of you have seen it but it 's a beaut and in the movie he plays a down-and-out lawyer who 's become an ambulance chaser and he 's taken on -- he 's given actually -- a malpractice suit to handle that 's sort of an easy deal and in the midst of trying to connect the deal he starts to empathize and identify with his client and he regains his morality and purpose and he goes on to win the case and in the depth of despair in the midst of the movie when it looks like he ca n't pull this thing off and he needs this case he needs to win this case so badly there 's a shot of paul newman alone in his office saying " this is the case there are no other cases this is the case there are no other cases " and in that moment of desire and focus he can win and that is a wonderful position to be in to create some serious play and i had that moment in 1994 when i met a theater director named george wolfe who was going to have me design an identity for the new york shakespeare festival then known and then became the public theater and i began getting immersed in this project in a way i never was before this is what theater advertising looked like at that time this is what was in the newspapers and in the new york times so this is sort of a comment on the time and the public theater actually had much better advertising than this they had no logo and no identity but they had these very iconic posters painted by paul davis and george wolf had taken over from another director and he wanted to change the theater and he wanted to make it urban and loud and a place that was inclusive so drawing on my love of typography i immersed myself into this project and what was different about it was the totality of it was that i really became the voice the visual voice of a place in a way i had never done before where every aspect -- the smallest ad the ticket whatever it was -- was designed by me there was no format there was no in-house department that these things were pushed to i literally for three years made everything -- every scrap of paper everything online that this theater did and it was the only job even though i was doing other jobs i lived and breathed it in a way i have n't with a client since it enabled me to really express myself and grow and i think that you know when you 're going to be given this position and it 's rare but when you get it and you have this opportunity it 's the moment of serious play i did these things and i still do them i still work for the public theater i 'm on their board and i still am involved with it the high point of the public theater i think was in 1996 two years after i designed it which was the " bring in 'da noise bring in 'da funk " campaign that was all over new york but something happened to it and what happened to it was it became very popular and that is a kiss of death for something serious because it makes it solemn and what happened was that new york city to a degree ate my identity because people began to copy it here 's an ad in the new york times somebody did for a play called " mind games " then " chicago " came out used similar graphics and the public theater 's identity was just totally eaten and taken away which meant i had to change it so i changed it so that every season was different and i continued to do these posters but they never had the seriousness of the first identity because they were too individual and they did n't have that heft of everything being the same thing now -- and i think since the public theater i must have done more than a dozen cultural identities for major institutions and i do n't think i ever -- i ever grasped that seriousness again -- i do them for very big important institutions in new york city the institutions are solemn and so is the design they 're better crafted than the public theater was and they spend more money on them but i think that that moment comes and goes the best way to accomplish serious design -- which i think we all have the opportunity to do -- is to be totally and completely unqualified for the job that does n't happen very often but it happened to me in the year 2000 when for some reason or another a whole pile of different architects started to ask me to design the insides of theaters with them where i would take environmental graphics and work them into buildings i 'd never done this kind of work before i did n't know how to read an architectural plan i did n't know what they were talking about and i really could n't handle the fact that a job -- a single job -- could go on for four years because i was used to immediacy in graphic design and that kind of attention to detail was really bad for somebody like me with add so it was a rough -- it was a rough go but i fell in love with this process of actually integrating graphics into architecture because i did n't know what i was doing i said " why ca n't the signage be on the floor " new yorkers look at their feet and then i found that actors and actresses actually take their cues from the floor so it turned out that these sorts of sign systems began to make sense they integrated with the building in really peculiar ways they ran around corners they went up sides of buildings and they melded into the architecture this is symphony space on 90th street and broadway and the type is interwoven into the stainless steel and backlit with fiber optics and the architect jim polshek essentially gave me a canvas to play typography out on and it was serious play this is the children 's museum in pittsburgh pennsylvania made out of completely inexpensive materials extruded typography that 's backlit with neon things i never did before built before i just thought they 'd be kind of fun to do donors ' walls made out of lucite and then inexpensive signage i think my favorite of these was this little job in newark new jersey it 's a performing arts school this is the building that -- they had no money and they had to recast it and they said if we give you 100,000 dollars what can you do with it and i did a little photoshop job on it and i said well i think we can paint it and we did and it was play and there 's the building everything was painted -- typography over the whole damn thing including the air conditioning ducts i hired guys who paint flats fixed on the sides of garages to do the painting on the building and they loved it they got into it -- they took the job incredibly seriously they used to climb up on the building and call me and tell me that they had to correct my typography -- that my spacing was wrong and they moved it and they did wonderful things with it they were pretty serious too it was quite wonderful by the time i did bloomberg 's headquarters my work had begun to become accepted people wanted it in big expensive places and that began to make it solemn bloomberg was all about numbers and we did big numbers through the space and the numbers were projected on a spectacular led that my partner lisa strausfeld programmed but it became the end of the seriousness of the play and it started to once again become solemn this is a current project in pittsburgh pennsylvania where i got to be goofy i was invited to design a logo for this neighborhood called the north side and i thought it was silly for a neighborhood to have a logo i think that 's rather creepy actually why would a neighborhood have a logo a neighborhood has a thing -- it 's got a landmark it 's got a place it 's got a restaurant it does n't have a logo i mean what would that be so i had to actually give a presentation to a city council and neighborhood constituents and i went to pittsburgh and i said " you know really what you have here are all these underpasses that separate the neighborhood from the center of town why do n't you celebrate them and make the underpasses landmarks " so i began doing this crazy presentation of these installations -- potential installations -- on these underpass bridges and stood up in front of the city council -- and was a little bit scared i have to admit but i was so utterly unqualified for this project and so utterly ridiculous and ignored the brief so desperately that i think they just embraced it with wholeheartedness just completely because it was so goofy to begin with and this is the bridge they 're actually painting up and preparing as we speak it will change every six months and it will become an art installation in the north side of pittsburgh and it will probably become a landmark in the area john hockenberry told you a bit about my travail with citibank that is now a 10-year relationship and i still work with them and i actually am amused by them and like them and think that as a very very very very very big corporation they actually keep their graphics very nice i drew the logo for citibank on a napkin in the first meeting that was the play part of the job and then i spent a year going to long tedious boring meetings trying to sell this logo through to a huge corporation to the point of tears i thought i was going to go crazy at the end of this year we made idiotic presentations showing how the citi logo made sense and how it was really derived from an umbrella and we made animations of these things and we came back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and it was worth it because they bought this thing and it played out on such a grand scale and it 's so internationally recognizable but for me it was actually a very very depressing year as a matter of fact they actually never bought onto the logo until fallon put it on its very good " live richly " campaign and then everybody accepted it all over the world so during this time i needed some kind of counterbalance for this crazy crazy existence of going to these long idiotic meetings and i was up in my country house and for some reason i began painting these very big very involved laborious complicated maps of the entire world and listing every place on the planet and putting them in and misspelling them and putting things in the wrong spot and completely controlling the information and going totally and completely nuts with it they would take me about six months initially but then i started getting faster at it here 's the united states every single city of the united states is on here and it hung for about eight months at the cooper-hewitt and people walked up to it and they would point to a part of the map and they 'd say " oh i 've been here " and of course they could n't have been because it 's in the wrong spot but what i liked about it was i was controlling my own idiotic information and i was creating my own palette of information and i was totally and completely at play one of my favorites was this painting i did of florida after the 2000 election that has the election results rolling around in the water i keep that for evidence somebody was up at my house and saw the paintings and recommended them to a gallery and i had a first show about two-and-a-half years ago and i showed these paintings that i 'm showing you now and then a funny thing happened -- they sold and they sold quickly and became rather popular we started making prints from them this is manhattan one from the series this is a print from the united states which we did in red white and blue we began doing these big silkscreen prints and they started selling too so the gallery wanted me to have another show in two years which meant that i really had to paint these paintings much faster than i had ever done them and i -- they started to become more political and i picked areas that sort of were in the news or that i had some feeling about and i began doing these things and then this funny thing happened i found that i was no longer at play i was actually in this solemn landscape of fulfilling an expectation for a show which is not where i started with these things so while they became successful i know how to make them so i 'm not a neophyte and they 're no longer serious -- they have become solemn and that 's a terrifying factor -- when you start something and it turns that way -- because it means that all that 's left for you is to go back and to find out what the next thing is that you can push that you can invent that you can be ignorant about that you can be arrogant about that you can fail with and that you can be a fool with because in the end that 's how you grow and that 's all that matters so i 'm plugging along here -- and i 'm just going to have to blow up the staircase thank you very much i 'll start with my favorite muse emily dickinson who said that wonder is not knowledge neither is it ignorance it 's something which is suspended between what we believe we can be and a tradition we may have forgotten and i think when i listen to these incredible people here i 've been so inspired -- so many incredible ideas so many visions and yet when i look at the environment outside you see how resistant architecture is to change you see how resistant it is to those very ideas we can think them out we can create incredible things and yet at the end it 's so hard to change a wall we applaud the well-mannered box but to create a space that never existed is what interests me ; to create something that has never been a space that we have never entered except in our minds and our spirits and i think that 's really what architecture is based on architecture is not based on concrete and steel and the elements of the soil it 's based on wonder and that wonder is really what has created the greatest cities the greatest spaces that we have had and i think that is indeed what architecture is it is a story by the way it is a story that is told through its hard materials but it is a story of effort and struggle against improbabilities if you think of the great buildings of the cathedrals of the temples of the pyramids of pagodas of cities in india and beyond you think of how incredible this is that that was realized not by some abstract idea but by people so anything that has been made can be unmade anything that has been made can be made better there it is : the things that i really believe are of important architecture these are the dimensions that i like to work with it 's something very personal it 's not perhaps the dimensions appreciated by art critics or architecture critics or city planners but i think these are the necessary oxygen for us to live in buildings to live in cities to connect ourselves in a social space and i therefore believe that optimism is what drives architecture forward it 's the only profession where you have to believe in the future you can be a general a politician an economist who is depressed a musician in a minor key a painter in dark colors but architecture is that complete ecstasy that the future can be better and it is that belief that i think drives society and today we have a kind of evangelical pessimism all around us and yet it is in times like this that i think architecture can thrive with big ideas ideas that are not small think of the great cities think of the empire state building the rockefeller center they were built in times that were not really the best of times in a certain way and yet that energy and power of architecture has driven an entire social and political space that these buildings occupy so again i am a believer in the expressive i have never been a fan of the neutral i do n't like neutrality in life in anything i think expression and it 's like espresso coffee you know you take the essence of the coffee that 's what expression is it 's been missing in much of the architecture because we think architecture is the realm of the neutered the realm of the kind of a state that has no opinion that has no value and yet i believe it is the expression -- expression of the city expression of our own space -- that gives meaning to architecture and of course expressive spaces are not mute expressive spaces are not spaces that simply confirm what we already know expressive spaces may disturb us and i think that 's also part of life life is not just an anesthetic to make us smile but to reach out across the abyss of history to places we have never been and would have perhaps been had we not been so lucky so again radical versus conservative radical what does it mean it 's something which is rooted and something which is rooted deep in a tradition and i think that is what architecture is it 's radical it 's not just a conservation in formaldehyde of dead forms it is actually a living connection to the cosmic event that we are part of and a story that is certainly ongoing it 's not something that has a good ending or a bad ending it 's actually a story in which our acts themselves are pushing the story in a particular way so again i am a believer in the radical architecture you know the soviet architecture of that building is the conservation it 's like the old las vegas used to be it 's about conserving emotions conserving the traditions that have obstructed the mind in moving forward and of course what is radical is to confront them and i think our architecture is a confrontation with our own senses therefore i believe it should not be cool there is a lot of appreciation for the kind of cool architecture i 've always been an opponent of it i think emotion is needed life without emotion would really not be life even the mind is emotional there is no reason which does not take a position in the ethical sphere in the philosophical mystery of what we are so i think emotion is a dimension that is important to introduce into city space into city life and of course we are all about the struggle of emotions and i think that is what makes the world a wondrous place and of course the confrontation of the cool the unemotional with emotion is a conversation that i think cities themselves have fostered i think that is the progress of cities it 's not only the forms of cities but the fact that they incarnate emotions not just of those who build them but of those who live there as well inexplicable versus understood you know too often we want to understand everything but architecture is not the language of words it 's a language but it is not a language that can be reduced to a series of programmatic notes that we can verbally write too many buildings that you see outside that are so banal tell you a story but the story is very short which says " we have no story to tell you " so the important thing actually is to introduce the actual architectural dimensions which might be totally inexplicable in words because they operate in proportions in materials in light they connect themselves into various sources into a kind of complex vector matrix that is n't really frontal but is really embedded in the lives and in the history of a city and of a people so again the notion that a building should just be explicit i think is a false notion which has reduced architecture into banality hand versus the computer of course what would we be without computers our whole practice depends on computing but the computer should not just be the glove of the hand ; the hand should really be the driver of the computing power because i believe that the hand in all its primitive in all its physiological obscurity has a source though the source is unknown though we do n't have to be mystical about it we realize that the hand has been given us by forces that are beyond our own autonomy and i think when i draw drawings which may imitate the computer but are not computer drawings -- drawings that can come from sources that are completely not known not normal not seen yet the hand -- and that 's what i really to all of you who are working -- how can we make the computer respond to our hand rather than the hand responding to the computer i think that 's part of what the complexity of architecture is because certainly we have gotten used to the propaganda that the simple is the good but i do n't believe it listening to all of you the complexity of thought the complexity of layers of meaning is overwhelming and i think we should n't shy away in architecture you know brain surgery atomic theory genetics economics are complex complex fields there is no reason that architecture should shy away and present this illusory world of the simple it is complex space is complex space is something that folds out of itself into completely new worlds and as wondrous as it is it can not be reduced to a kind of simplification that we have often come to be admired and yet our lives are complex our emotions are complex our intellectual desires are complex so i do believe that architecture as i see it needs to mirror that complexity in every single space that we have in every intimacy that we possess of course that means that architecture is political the political is not an enemy of architecture the politeama is the city it 's all of us together and i 've always believed that the act of architecture even a private house when somebody else will see it is a political act because it will be visible to others and we live in a world which is connecting us more and more so again the evasion of that sphere which has been so endemic to that sort of pure architecture the autonomous architecture that is just an abstract object has never appealed to me and i do believe that this interaction with the history with history that is often very difficult to grapple with it to create a position that is beyond our normal expectations and to create a critique because architecture is also the asking of questions it 's not only the giving of answers it 's also just like life the asking of questions therefore it is important that it be real you know we can simulate almost anything but the one thing that can be ever simulated is the human heart the human soul and architecture is so closely intertwined with it because we are born somewhere and we die somewhere so the reality of architecture is visceral it 's not intellectual it 's not something that comes to us from books and theories it 's the real that we touch -- the door the window the threshold the bed -- such prosaic objects and yet i try in every building to take that virtual world which is so enigmatic and so rich and create something in the real world create a space for an office a space of sustainability that really works between that virtuality and yet can be realized as something real unexpected versus habitual what is a habit it 's just a shackle for ourselves it 's a self-induced poison so the unexpected is always unexpected you know it 's true the cathedrals as unexpected will always be unexpected you know frank gehry 's buildings they will continue to be unexpected in the future so not the habitual architecture that instills in us the false sort of stability but an architecture that is full of tension an architecture that goes beyond itself to reach a human soul and a human heart and that breaks out of the shackles of habits and of course habits are enforced by architecture when we see the same kind of architecture we become immured in that world of those angles of those lights of those materials we think the world really looks like our buildings and yet our buildings are pretty much limited by the techniques and wonders that have been part of them so again the unexpected which is also the raw and i often think of the raw and the refined what is raw the raw i would say is the naked experience untouched by luxury untouched by expensive materials untouched by the kind of refinement that we associate with high culture so the rawness i think in space the fact that sustainability can actually in the future translate into a raw space a space that is n't decorated a space that is not mannered in any source but a space that might be cool in terms of its temperature might be refractive to our desires a space that does n't always follow us like a dog that has been trained to follow us but moves ahead into directions of demonstrating other possibilities other experiences that have never been part of the vocabulary of architecture and of course that juxtaposition is of great interest to me because it creates a kind of a spark of new energy and so i do like something which is pointed not blunt something which is focused on reality something that has the power through its leverage to transform even a very small space so architecture maybe is not so big like science but through its focal point it can leverage in an archimedian way what we think the world is really about and often it takes just a building to change our experience of what could be done what has been done how the world has remained both in between stability and instability and of course buildings have their shapes those shapes are difficult to change and yet i do believe that in every social space in every public space there is a desire to communicate more than just that blunt thought that blunt technique but something that pinpoints and can point in various directions forward backward sideways and around so that is indeed what is memory so i believe that my main interest is to memory without memory we would be amnesiacs we would not know which way we were going and why we are going where we 're going so i 've been never interested in the forgettable reuse rehashing of the same things over and over again which of course get accolades of critics critics like the performance to be repeated again and again the same way but i rather play something completely unheard of and even with flaws than repeat the same thing over and over which has been hollowed by its meaninglessness so again memory is the city memory is the world without the memory there would be no story to tell there would be nowhere to turn the memorable i think is really our world what we think the world is and it 's not only our memory but those who remember us which means that architecture is not mute it 's an art of communication it tells a story the story can reach into obscure desires it can reach into sources that are not explicitly available it can reach into millennia that have been buried and return them in a just and unexpected equity so again i think the notion that the best architecture is silent has never appealed to me silence maybe is good for a cemetery but not for a city cities should be full of vibrations full of sound full of music and that indeed is the architectural mission that i believe is important is to create spaces that are vibrant that are pluralistic that can transform the most prosaic activities and raise them to a completely different expectation create a shopping center a swimming place that is more like a museum than like entertainment and these are our dreams and of course risk i think architecture should be risky you know it costs a lot of money and so on but yes it should not play it safe it should not play it safe because if it plays it safe it 's not moving us in a direction that we want to be and i think of course risk is what underlies the world world without risk would not be worth living so yes i do believe that the risk we take in every building risks to create spaces that have never been cantilevered to that extent risks of spaces that have never been so dizzying as they should be for a pioneering city risks that really move architecture even with all its flaws into a space which is much better that the ever again repeated hollowness of a ready-made thing and of course that is finally what i believe architecture to be it 's about space it 's not about fashion it 's not about decoration it 's about creating with minimal means something which can not be repeated can not be simulated in any other sphere and there of course is the space that we need to breathe is the space we need to dream these are the spaces that are not just luxurious spaces for some of us but are important for everybody in this world so again it 's not about the changing fashions changing theories it 's about carving out a space for trees it 's carving out a space where nature can enter the domestic world of a city a space where something which has never seen a light of day can enter into the inner workings of a density and i think that is really the nature of architecture now i am a believer in democracy i do n't like beautiful buildings built for totalitarian regimes where people can not speak can not vote can not do anything we too often admire those buildings we think they are beautiful and yet when i think of the poverty of society which does n't give freedom to its people i do n't admire those buildings so democracy as difficult as it is i believe in it and of course at ground zero what else it 's such a complex project it 's emotional there is so many interests it 's political there is so many parties to this project there is so many interests there 's money there 's political power there are emotions of the victims and yet in all its messiness in all its difficulties i would not have liked somebody to say " this is the tabula rasa mister architect -- do whatever you want " i think nothing good will come out of that i think architecture is about consensus and it is about the dirty word " compromise " compromise is not bad compromise if it 's artistic if it is able to cope with its strategies -- and there is my first sketch and the last rendering -- it 's not that far away and yet compromise consensus that is what i believe in and ground zero despite all its difficulties it 's moving forward it 's difficult 2011 2013 freedom tower the memorial and that is where i end i was inspired when i came here as an immigrant on a ship like millions of others looking at america from that point of view this is america this is liberty this is what we dream about its individuality demonstrated in the skyline it 's resilience and finally it 's the freedom that america represents not just to me as an immigrant but to everyone in the world thank you chris anderson : i 've got a question so have you come to peace with the process that happened at ground zero and the loss of the original incredible design that you came up with daniel libeskind : look we have to cure ourselves of the notion that we are authoritarian that we can determine everything that happens we have to rely on others and shape the process in the best way possible i came from the bronx i was taught not to be a loser not to be somebody who just gives up in a fight you have to fight for what you believe you do n't always win everything you want to win but you can steer the process and i believe that what will be built at ground zero will be meaningful will be inspiring will tell other generations of the sacrifices of the meaning of this event not just for new york but for the world i coined my own definition of success in 1934 when i was teaching at a high school in south bend indiana being a little bit disappointed and delusioned perhaps by the way parents of the youngsters in my english classes expected their youngsters to get an a or a b they thought a c was all right for the neighbors ' children because the neighbors children are all average but they were n't satisfied when their own -- would make the teacher feel that they had failed or the youngster had failed and that 's not right the good lord in his infinite wisdom did n't create us all equal as far as intelligence is concerned any more than we 're equal for size appearance not everybody could earn an a or a b and i did n't like that way of judging it and i did know how the alumni of various schools back in the 30s judged coaches and athletic teams if you won them all you were considered to be reasonably successful -- not completely because i found out -- we had a number of years at ucla where we did n't lose a game but it seemed that we did n't win each individual game by the margin that some of our alumni had predicted and quite frequently i -- -- quite frequently i really felt that they had backed up their predictions in a more materialistic manner but that was true back in the 30s so i understood that but i did n't like it and i did n't agree with it and i wanted to come up with something that i hoped could make me a better teacher and give the youngsters under my supervision -- whether it be in athletics or in the english classroom -- something to which to aspire other than just a higher mark in the classroom or more points in some athletic contest i thought about that for quite a spell and i wanted to come up with my own definition i thought that might help and i knew how mr. webster defined it : as the accumulation of material possessions or the attainment of a position of power or prestige or something of that sort -- worthy accomplishments perhaps but in my opinion not necessarily indicative of success so i wanted to come up with something of my own and i recalled -- i was raised on a small farm in southern indiana and dad tried to teach me and my brothers that you should never try to be better than someone else i 'm sure at the time he did that i did n't -- it did n't -- well somewhere i guess in the hidden recesses of mind it popped out years later never try to be better than someone else always learn from others never cease trying to be the best you can be -- that 's under your control if you get too engrossed and involved and concerned in regard to the things over which you have no control it will adversely affect the things over which you have control then i ran across this simple verse that said " at god 's footstool to confess a poor soul knelt and bowed his head 'i failed ! ' he cried the master said 'thou didst thy best that is success ' " from those things and one other perhaps i coined my own definition of success which is : peace of mind attained only through self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to do the best of which you 're capable i believe that 's true if you make the effort to do the best of which you 're capable to try and improve the situation that exists for you i think that 's success and i do n't think others can judge that i think it 's like character and reputation your reputation is what you are perceived to be ; your character is what you really are and i think that character is much more important than what you are perceived to be you 'd hope they 'd both be good but they wo n't necessarily be the same well that was my idea that i was going to try to get across to the youngsters i ran across other things i love to teach and it was mentioned by the previous speaker that i enjoy poetry and i dabble in it a bit and love it there are some things that helped me i think be better than i would have been i know i 'm not what i ought to be not what i should be but i think i 'm better than i would have been if i had n't run across certain things one was just a little verse that said " no written word no spoken plea can teach our youth what they should be nor all the books on all the shelves -- it 's what the teachers are themselves " that made an impression on me in the 1930s and i tried to use that more or less in my teaching whether it be in sports or whether it be in the english classroom i love poetry and always had an interest in that somehow maybe it 's because dad used to read to us at night coal oil lamp -- we did n't have electricity in our farm home and dad would read poetry to us so i always liked it and about the same time i ran across this one verse i ran across another one someone asked a lady teacher why she taught and she -- after some time she said she wanted to think about that then she came up and said " they ask me why i teach and i reply 'where could i find such splendid company ' there sits a statesman strong unbiased wise ; another daniel webster silver-tongued a doctor sits beside him whose quick steady hand may mend a bone or stem the life-blood 's flow and there a builder upward rise the arch of a church he builds wherein that minister may speak the word of god and lead a stumbling soul to touch the christ and all about a gathering of teachers farmers merchants laborers : those who work and vote and build and plan and pray into a great tomorrow and i may say i may not see the church or hear the word or eat the food their hands may grow but yet again i may and later i may say i knew him once and he was weak or strong or bold or proud or gay i knew him once but then he was a boy they ask me why i teach and i reply 'where could i find such splendid company ' " and i believe the teaching profession -- it 's true you have so many youngsters and i 've got to think of my youngsters at ucla -- 30-some attorneys 11 dentists and doctors many many teachers and other professions and that gives you a great deal of pleasure to see them go on i always tried to make the youngsters feel that they 're there to get an education number one basketball was second because it was paying their way and they do need a little time for social activities but you let social activities take a little precedence over the other two and you 're not going to have any very long so that was the ideas that i tried to get across to the youngsters under my supervision i had three rules pretty much that i stuck with practically all the time i 'd learned these prior to coming to ucla and i decided they were very important one was -- never be late never be late later on i said certain things -- i had -- players if we 're leaving for somewhere had to be neat and clean there was a time when i made them wear jackets and shirts and ties then i saw our chancellor coming to school in denims and turtlenecks and i thought not right for me to keep this other so i let them -- just they had to be neat and clean i had one of my greatest players that you probably heard of bill walton he came to catch the bus ; we were leaving for somewhere to play and he was n't clean and neat so i would n't let him go he could n't get on the bus he had to go home and get cleaned up to get to the airport so i was a stickler for that i believed in that i believe in time -- very important i believe you should be on time but i felt at practice for example we start on time we close on time the youngsters did n't have to feel that we were going to keep them over when i speak at coaching clinics i often tell young coaches -- and at coaching clinics more or less they 'll be the younger coaches getting in the profession most of them are young you know and probably newly married and i tell them " do n't run practices late because you 'll go home in a bad mood and that 's not good for a young married man to go home in a bad mood when you get older it does n't make any difference " but -- so i did believe on time i believe starting on time and i believe closing on time and another one i had was not one word of profanity one word of profanity and you are out of here for the day if i see it in a game you 're going to come out and sit on the bench and the third one was never criticize a teammate i did n't want that i used to tell them i was paid to do that that 's my job i 'm paid to do it pitifully poor but i am paid to do it not like the coaches today for gracious sakes no it 's a little different than it was in my day those were three things that i stuck with pretty closely all the time and those actually came from my dad that 's what he tried to teach me and my brothers at one time i came up with a pyramid eventually that i do n't have the time to go on that but that helped me i think become a better teacher it 's something like this : and i had blocks in the pyramid and the cornerstones being industriousness and enthusiasm working hard and enjoying what you 're doing coming up to the apex according to my definition of success and right at the top -- faith and patience and i say to you in whatever you 're doing you must be patient you have to have patience to -- we want things to happen we talk about our youth being impatient a lot and they are they want to change everything they think all change is progress and we get a little older -- we sort of let things go and we forget there is no progress without change so you must have patience and i believe that we must have faith i believe that we must believe truly believe not just give it word service ; believe that things will work out as they should providing we do what we should i think our tendency is to hope that things will turn out the way we want them to much of the time but we do n't do the things that are necessary to make those things become reality i worked on this for some 14 years and i think it helped me become a better teacher but it all revolved around that original definition of success you know a number of years ago there was a major league baseball umpire by the name of george moriarty he spelled moriarty with only one 'i ' i 'd never seen that before but he did big league baseball players -- they 're very perceptive about those things and they noticed he had only one 'i ' in his name you 'd be surprised how many also told him that that was one more than he had in his head at various times but he wrote something that i think he did while i tried to do in this pyramid he called it " the road ahead or the road behind " " sometimes i think the fates must grin as we denounce them and insist the only reason we ca n't win is the fates themselves that miss yet there lives on the ancient claim : we win or lose within ourselves the shining trophies on our shelves can never win tomorrow 's game you and i know deeper down there 's always a chance to win the crown but when we fail to give our best we simply have n't met the test of giving all and saving none until the game is really won ; of showing what is meant by grit ; of playing through when others quit ; of playing through not letting up it 's bearing down that wins the cup of dreaming there 's a goal ahead ; of hoping when our dreams are dead ; of praying when our hopes have fled yet losing not afraid to fall if bravely we have given all for who can ask more of a man than giving all within his span giving all it seems to me is not so far from victory and so the fates are seldom wrong no matter how they twist and wind it 's you and i who make our fates -- we open up or close the gates on the road ahead or the road behind " reminds me of another set of threes that my dad tried to get across to us do n't whine do n't complain do n't make excuses just get out there and whatever you 're doing do it to the best of your ability and no one can do more than that i tried to get across too that -- my opponents do n't tell you -- you never heard me mention winning never mention winning my idea is that you can lose when you outscore somebody in a game and you can win when you 're outscored i 've felt that way on certain occasions at various times and i just wanted them to be able to hold their head up after a game i used to say that when a game is over and you see somebody that did n't know the outcome i hope they could n't tell by your actions whether you outscored an opponent or the opponent outscored you that 's what really matters : if you make effort to do the best you can regularly the results will be about what they should be not necessary to what you would want them to be but they will be about what they should and only you will know whether you can do that and that 's what i wanted from them more than anything else and as time went by and i learned more about other things i think it worked a little better as far as the results but i wanted the score of a game to be the byproduct of these other things and not the end itself i believe it was -- one great philosopher said -- no no cervantes cervantes said " the journey is better than the end " and i like that i think that is -- it 's getting there sometimes when you get there there 's almost a letdown but there 's getting there that 's the fun i liked our -- as a basketball coach at ucla i liked our practices to be the journey and the game would be the end the end result i 'd like to go up and sit in the stands and watch the players play and see whether i 'd done a decent job during the week there again it 's getting the players to get that self-satisfaction in knowing that they 'd made the effort to do the best of which they are capable sometimes i 'm asked who was the best player i had or the best teams i can never answer that as far as the individuals are concerned i was asked one time about that and they said " suppose that you in some way could make the perfect player what would you want " and i said " well i 'd want one that knew why he was at ucla : to get an education he was a good student really knew why he was there in the first place but i 'd want one that could play too i 'd want one to realize that defense usually wins championships and would work hard on defense but i 'd want one that would play offense too i 'd want him to be unselfish and look for the pass first and not shoot all the time and i 'd want one that could pass and would pass i 've had some that could and would n't and i 've had some that would and could n't i wanted them to be able to shoot from the outside i wanted them to be good inside too i 'd want them to be able to rebound well at both ends too and why not just take someone like keith wilkes and let it go at that he had the qualifications not the only one but he was one that i used in that particular category because i think he made the effort to become the best [ unclear ] i mention in my book " they call me coach " two players that gave me great satisfaction ; that came as close as i think anyone i ever had to reach their full potential : one was conrad burke and one was doug mcintosh when i saw them as freshmen on our freshmen team -- we did n't have -- freshmen could n't play varsity when i taught and i thought " oh gracious if these two players either one of them " -- they were different years but i thought about each one at the time he was there -- " oh if he ever makes the varsity our varsity must be pretty miserable if he 's good enough to make it " and you know one of them was a starting player for a season and a half the other was -- his next year he played 32 minutes in a national championship game did a tremendous job for us and the next year he was a starting player on the national championship team and here i thought he 'd never play a minute when he was -- so those are the things that give you great joy and great satisfaction to see one neither one of those youngsters could shoot very well but they had outstanding shooting percentages because they did n't force it and neither one could jump very well but they got -- kept good position and so they did well rebounding they remembered that every shot that is taken they assumed would be missed i 've had too many that stand around and wait to see if it 's missed then they go and it 's too late somebody else is in there ahead of them and they were n't very quick but they played good position kept in good balance and so they played pretty good defense for us so they had qualities that -- they came close to -- as close to reaching possibly their full potential as any players i ever had so i consider them to be as successful as lewis alcindor or bill walton or many of the others that we had there was some outstanding -- some outstanding players have i rambled enough i was told that when he makes his appearance i was supposed to shut up video : narrator : an event seen from one point of view gives one impression seen from another point of view it gives quite a different impression but it 's only when you get the whole picture you can fully understand what 's going on sasha vucinic : it 's a great clip is n't it and i found that in 29 seconds it tells more about the power of and importance of independent media than i could say in an hour so i thought that it will be good to start with it and also start with a little bit of statistics according to relevant researchers 83 percent of the population of this planet lives in the societies without independent press think about that number : 83 percent of the population on the whole planet does not really know what is going on in their countries the information they get gets filtered through somebody who either twists that information or colors that information does something with it so they 're deprived of understanding their reality that is just to understand how big and important this problem is now those of you who are lucky enough to live in those societies that represent 17 percent i think should enjoy it until it lasts you know sunday morning you flick the paper get your cappuccino enjoy it while it lasts because as we heard yesterday countries can lose stars from their flags but they can also lose press freedom as i guess americans among us can tell us more about but that 's totally another and separate topic so i can go back to my story my story starts -- the story i want to share -- starts in 1991 at that time i was running b92 the only independent for that matter the only electronic media in the country and i guess we were sharing -- we had that regular life of the only independent media in the country operating in hostile environment where government really wants to make your life miserable and there are different ways yeah it was the usual cocktail : a little bit of threats a little bit of friendly advice a little bit of financial police a little bit of text control so you always have somebody who never leaves your office but what they really do which is very powerful and that is what governments in the late '90s started doing if they do n't like independent media companies -- you know they threaten your advertisers once they threaten your advertisers market forces are actually you know destroyed and the advertisers do not want to come -- no matter how much does it make sense for them -- do not want to come and advertise and you have a problem making ends meet at that time at the beginning of the '90s we had that problem which was you know survival below one side but what was really painful for me was remember the beginning of the '90s yugoslavia is falling apart we were sitting over there with a country in a downfall in a slow-motion downfall and we all had all of that on tapes we had the ability to understand what was going on we were actually recording history the problem was that we had to re-tape that history a week later ; because if we did not we could not afford enough tapes to keep archives of that history so if i gave you that picture i do n't want to go too long on that in that context a gentleman came to my office at that time it was still 1991 he was running a media systems organization which is still in business the gentleman is still in business and what did i know at that time about media systems i would think media systems were organizations which means they should help you so i prepared two plans for that meeting two strategic plans : the small one and the big one the small one was i just wanted him to help us get those damn tapes so we can keep that archive for the next 50 years the big plan was to ask him for a 1,000,000-dollar loan because i thought i still maintain that serious and independent media companies are great business and i thought that b92 will survive and be a great company once milosevic is gone which turned out to be true it 's now probably either the biggest or the second biggest media company in the country and i thought that the only thing that we needed at that time was 1,000,000-dollar loan to take us through those hard times to make a long story short the gentleman comes into the office great suit and tie i gave him what i thought was a brilliant explanation of the political situation and explained how hard and difficult the war will be actually i underestimated the atrocities i have to admit anyway after that whole big long explanation the only question he had for me -- and this is not a joke -- is are we paying royalties after we broadcast music of michael jackson that was really the only question he had he left and i remember being actually very angry at myself because i thought there must be an institution in the world that is providing loans to media companies it 's so obvious straight in your face and somebody must have thought of it somebody must have started something like that and i thought i 'm just dumb and i can not find it you know in my defense there was no google at that time ; you could not just google in '91 so i thought that that 's actually my problem now we go from here fast forward to 1995 i have -- i left the country i have a meeting with george soros trying for the third time to convince him that his foundation should invest in something that should operate like a media bank and basically what i was saying is very simple you know forget about charity ; it does n't work forget about handouts ; 20,000 dollars do not help anybody what you should do is you should treat media companies as a business it 's business anywhere media business or any other business it needs to be capitalized and what these guys need actually is access to capital so third meeting arguments are pretty well exercised at the end of the meeting he says look it is not going to work ; you will never see your money back ; but my foundations will put 500,000 dollars so you can test the idea see that it will not work he said i 'll give you a rope to hang yourself i knew two things after that meeting first under no circumstances i want to hang myself and second that i have no idea how to make it work you see at the level of a concept it was a great concept but it 's one thing to have a concept ; it 's a totally separate thing to actually make it work so i had absolutely no idea how that could actually work had the wrong idea ; i thought that we can be a bank you see banks -- i do n't know if there are any bankers over here ; i apologize in advance -- but it 's the best job in the world you know you find somebody who is respectable and has a lot of money you give them more money ; they repay you that over a time you collect interest and do nothing in between so i thought why do n't we get into that business so here we are having our first client brilliant first independent newspaper in slovakia the government cutting them off from all the printing facilities in bratislava so here 's the daily newspaper that has to be printed 400 kilometers away from the capital it 's a daily newspaper with a deadline of 4 p.m that means that they have no sports ; they have no latest news ; circulation goes down it 's a kind of very nice sophisticated way how to economically strangle a daily newspaper they come to us with a request for a loan they want to -- the only way for them to survive is to get a printing press and we said that 's fine ; let 's meet ; you 'll bring us your business plan which eventually they did we start the meeting i get these two pieces of paper not like this a4 format so it 's much bigger a lot of numbers there a lot of numbers but however you put it you know the numbers do not make any sense and that 's the best they could do we were the best that they could do so that is how we understood what our method is it 's not a bank we had to actually go into these companies and earn our return by fixing them -- by establishing management systems by providing all that knowledge how do you run a business on one side -- while they all know how to run how to create content just quickly on the results over these 10 years 40 million dollars in affordable financing average interest rate five percent to six percent lately we are going wild charging seven percent from time to time we do it in 17 countries of the developing world and here is the most stunning number return rate -- the one that soros was so worried about -- 97 percent 97 percent of all the scheduled repayments came back to us on time what do we typically finance we finance anything that a media company would need from printing presses to transmitters what is most important is we do it either in form of loans equities lease -- whatever is appropriate for you know supporting anybody but what is most important here is who do we finance we believe that in the last 10 years companies that we 've financed are actually the best media companies in the developing world that is a " who is who " list and i could spend hours talking about them because they 're all kind of heroes and i can but i 'll give you just maybe one and depending on time i may give you two examples who we work with you see we started working in eastern and central europe and moved to russia our first loan in russia was in chelyabinsk i 'll bet half of you have never heard of that place in the south of russia there 's a guy called boris nikolayevich kirshin who is running an independent newspaper there the city was closed until early '90s because of all things they were producing glass for tupolev planes anyway he 's running independent newspaper there after two years working with us he becomes the most respected newspaper in that small place governor comes to him one day actually invites him to come to his office he goes and sees the governor the governor says boris nikolayevich i understand you are doing a great job and you are the most respected newspaper in our district and i want to offer you a deal can you please give me your newspaper for the next nine months because i have elections -- there are elections coming up in nine months i will not run but it 's very important for me who is going to succeed me so give me the paper for nine months i 'll give it back to you i have no interest in being in media business how much would that cost boris nikolayevich says " it 's not for sale " the governor says " we will close you " boris nikolayevich says " no you can not do it " six months later the newspaper was closed luckily we had enough time to help boris nikolayevich take all the assets out of that company and bring him into a new one to get all the subscription lists rehire staff so what the governor got was an empty shell but that is what happens if you 're in business of independent media and if you are a banker for independent media so it sounds like a great story somewhere down the road we opened a media management center we started our media lab sounds like a real great story but there is a second angle to that the second angle like in this clip if you take the camera above you start thinking about these numbers again 40 million dollars over 10 years spread over 17 countries that is not too much is it it 's actually just a drop in the sea because when you think about the importance some of the issues that we were talking about last night -- this last session we had about africa and his hypothetical 50 billion dollars destined for africa all of those not all half of those problems mentioned last night -- government accountability corruption how do you fight corruption giving voice to unheard to poor -- it 's why independent media is in business and it 's why it was invented so from that perspective what we did is just really one drop in the sea of that need that we can identify now ours is just one story i 'm sure that in this room there are like 15 other wonderful stories of nonprofits doing spectacular work here is where the problem is and i 'll explain to you as well as i can what the problem is and it 's called fundraising imagine that this third of this room is filled with people who represent different foundations imagine two thirds over here running excellent organizations doing very important work now imagine that every second person over here is deaf does not hear and switch the lights off now that is how difficult it is to match people from this side of the room with people of that side of the room so we thought that some kind of a big idea is needed to reform to totally rethink fundraising you know instead of people running in this dark trying to find their own match who will be willing who has the same goals instead of all of that we thought there is -- something new needs to be invented and we came up with this idea of issuing bonds press freedom bonds if there are investors willing to finance u.s. government budget deficit why would n't we find investors willing to finance press freedom deficit we 've decided to do it this fall ; we will issue them probably in denominations of 1,000 dollars i do n't want to advertise them too much ; that 's not the point but the point is if we ever survive to actually issue them find enough investors that this can be considered a success there 's nothing stopping the next organization to start to issue bonds next spring and those can be environmental bonds and then two weeks later iqbal quadir can issue his electricity in bangladesh bonds and before you know it any social cause can be actually financed in this way now we do daydreaming in 11:30 with 55 seconds left but let 's take the idea further you do it you start it in the states because it 's you know concepts are very very close to american minds but you can actually bring it to europe too you can bring it to asia you can once you have all of those different points you can make it easy for investors put all of those bonds at one place and they sit down and click once you have more than 10 of them you have to develop some kind of a matrix what do investors get on one side financial on the other side social so that brings the idea of some kind of rating agency morningstar type it says you know social impact over here is spectacular five stars financial they give you one percent only one star now take it to the last step once you have all of that put together there 's not one reason why you could n't actually have a marketplace for all of that where you can not dispose of all of those bonds in a pretty quick way and in that way you organize the financing so there are no dark rooms no blind people running around to find each other thank you so indeed i have spent my life looking into the lives of presidents who are no longer alive waking up with abraham lincoln in the morning thinking of franklin roosevelt when i went to bed at night but when i try and think about what i 've learned about the meaning in life my mind keeps wandering back to a seminar that i took when i was a graduate student at harvard with the great psychologist erik erikson he taught us that the richest and fullest lives attempt to achieve an inner balance between three realms : work love and play and that to pursue one realm to the disregard of the other is to open oneself to ultimate sadness in older age whereas to pursue all three with equal dedication is to make possible a life filled not only with achievement but with serenity so since i tell stories let me look back on the lives of two of the presidents i 've studied to illustrate this point -- abraham lincoln and lyndon johnson as for that first sphere of work i think what abraham lincoln 's life suggests is that fierce ambition is a good thing he had a huge ambition but it was n't simply for office or power or celebrity or fame -- what it was for was to accomplish something worthy enough in life so that he could make the world a little better place for his having lived in it even as a child it seemed lincoln dreamed heroic dreams he somehow had to escape that hard-scrabble farm from which he was born no schooling was possible for him except a few weeks here a few weeks there but he read books in every spare moment he could find it was said when he got a copy of the king james bible or " aesop 's fables " he was so excited he could n't sleep he could n't eat the great poet emily dickinson once said " there is no frigate like a book to take us lands away " how true for lincoln though he never would travel to europe he went with shakespeare 's kings to merry england he went with lord byron 's poetry to spain and portugal literature allowed him to transcend his surroundings but there were so many losses in his early life that he was haunted by death his mother died when he was only nine years old ; his only sister sarah in childbirth a few years later ; and his first love ann rutledge at the age of 22 moreover when his mother lay dying she did not hold out for him the hope that they would meet in an afterworld she simply said to him " abraham i 'm going away from you now and i shall never return " as a result he became obsessed with the thought that when we die our life is swept away -- dust to dust but only as he grew older did he develop a certain consolation from an ancient greek notion -- but followed by other cultures as well -- that if you could accomplish something worthy in your life you could live on in the memory of others your honor and your reputation would outlive your earthly existence and that worthy ambition became his lodestar it carried him through the one significant depression that he suffered when he was in his early 30s three things had combined to lay him low he had broken his engagement with mary todd not certain he was ready to marry her but knowing how devastating it was to her that he did that his one intimate friend joshua speed was leaving illinois to go back to kentucky because speed 's father had died and his political career in the state legislature was on a downward slide he was so depressed that friends worried he was suicidal they took all knives and razors and scissors from his room and his great friend speed went to his side and said " lincoln you must rally or you will die " he said that " i would just as soon die right now but i 've not yet done anything to make any human being remember that i have lived " so fueled by that ambition he returned to the state legislature he eventually won a seat in congress he then ran twice for the senate lost twice " everyone is broken by life " ernest hemingway once said " but some people are stronger in the broken places " so then he surprised the nation with an upset victory for the presidency over three far more experienced far more educated far more celebrated rivals and then when he won the general election he stunned the nation even more by appointing each of these three rivals into his cabinet it was an unprecedented act at the time because everybody thought " he 'll look like a figurehead compared to these people " they said " why are you doing this lincoln " he said " look these are the strongest and most able men in the country the country is in peril i need them by my side " but perhaps my old friend lyndon johnson might have put it in less noble fashion : " better to have your enemies inside the tent pissing out than outside the tent pissing in " but it soon became clear that abraham lincoln would emerge as the undisputed captain of this unruly team for each of them soon came to understand that he possessed an unparalleled array of emotional strengths and political skills that proved far more important than the thinness of his external rÃ©sumÃ© for one thing he possessed an uncanny ability to empathize with and to think about other peoples ' point of view he repaired injured feelings that might have escalated into permanent hostility he shared credit with ease assumed responsibility for the failure of his subordinates constantly acknowledged his errors and learned from his mistakes these are the qualities we should be looking for in our candidates in 2008 he refused to be provoked by petty grievances he never submitted to jealousy or brooded over perceived slights and he expressed his unshakeable convictions in everyday language in metaphors in stories and with a beauty of language -- almost as if the shakespeare and the poetry he had so loved as a child had worked their way into his very soul in 1863 when the emancipation proclamation was signed he brought his old friend joshua speed back to the white house and remembered that conversation of decades before when he was so sad and he pointing to the proclamation said " i believe in this measure my fondest hopes will be realized " but as he was about to put his signature on the proclamation his own hand was numb and shaking because he had shaken a thousand hands that morning at a new year 's reception so he put the pen down he said " if ever my soul were in an act it is in this act but if i sign with a shaking hand posterity will say 'he hesitated ' " so he waited until he could take up the pen and sign with a bold and clear hand but even in his wildest dreams lincoln could never have imagined how far his reputation would reach i was so thrilled to find an interview with the great russian writer leo tolstoy in a new york newspaper in the early 1900s and in it tolstoy told of a trip that he 'd recently made to a very remote area of the caucasus where there were only wild barbarians who had never left this part of russia knowing that tolstoy was in their midst they asked him to tell stories of the great men of history so he said " i told them about napoleon and alexander the great and frederick the great and julius caesar and they loved it but before i finished the chief of the barbarians stood up and said 'but wait you have n't told us about the greatest ruler of them all we want to hear about that man who spoke with a voice of thunder who laughed like the sunrise who came from that place called america which is so far from here that if a young man should travel there he would be an old man when he arrived tell us of that man tell us of abraham lincoln ' " he was stunned he told them everything he could about lincoln and then in the interview he said " what made lincoln so great not as great a general as napoleon not as great a statesman as frederick the great " but his greatness consisted and historians would roundly agree in the integrity of his character and the moral fiber of his being so in the end that powerful ambition that had carried lincoln through his bleak childhood had been realized that ambition that had allowed him to laboriously educate himself by himself to go through that string of political failures and the darkest days of the war his story would be told so as for that second sphere not of work but of love -- encompassing family friends and colleagues -- it too takes work and commitment the lyndon johnson that i saw in the last years of his life when i helped him on his memoirs was a man who had spent so many years in the pursuit of work power and individual success that he had absolutely no psychic or emotional resources left to get him through the days once the presidency was gone my relationship with him began on a rather curious level i was selected as a white house fellow when i was 24 years old we had a big dance at the white house president johnson did dance with me that night not that peculiar -- there were only three women out of the 16 white house fellows but he did whisper in my ear that he wanted me to work directly for him in the white house but it was not to be that simple for in the months leading up to my selection like many young people i 'd been active in the anti-vietnam war movement and had written an article against lyndon johnson which unfortunately came out in the new republic two days after the dance in the white house and the theme of the article was how to remove lyndon johnson from power so i was certain he would kick me out of the program but instead surprisingly he said " oh bring her down here for a year and if i ca n't win her over no one can " so i did end up working for him in the white house eventually accompanied him to his ranch to help him on those memoirs never fully understanding why he 'd chosen me to spend so many hours with i like to believe it was because i was a good listener he was a great storyteller fabulous colorful anecdotal stories there was a problem with these stories however which i later discovered which is that half of them were n't true but they were great nonetheless so i think that part of his attraction for me was that i loved listening to his tall tales but i also worried that part of it was that i was then a young woman and he had somewhat of a minor league womanizing reputation so i constantly chatted to him about boyfriends even when i did n't have any at all everything was working perfectly until one day he said he wanted to discuss our relationship sounded very ominous when he took me nearby to the lake conveniently called lake lyndon baines johnson and there was wine and cheese and a red-checked tablecloth -- all the romantic trappings and he started out " doris more than any other woman i have ever known â€¦ " and my heart sank and then he said " you remind me of my mother " it was pretty embarrassing given what was going on in my mind but i must say the older i 've gotten the more i realize what an incredible privilege it was to have spent so many hours with this aging lion of a man a victor in a thousand contests three great civil rights laws medicare aid to education and yet roundly defeated in the end by the war in vietnam and because he was so sad and so vulnerable he opened up to me in ways he never would have had i known him at the height of his power -- sharing his fears his sorrows and his worries and i 'd like to believe that the privilege fired within me the drive to understand the inner person behind the public figure that i 've tried to bring to each of my books since then but it also brought home to me the lessons which erik erikson had tried to instill in all of us about the importance of finding balance in life for on the surface lyndon johnson should have had everything in the world to feel good about in those last years in the sense that he had been elected to the presidency ; he had all the money he needed to pursue any leisure activity he wanted ; he owned a spacious ranch in the countryside a penthouse in the city sailboats speedboats he had servants to answer any whim and he had a family who loved him deeply and yet years of concentration solely on work and individual success meant that in his retirement he could find no solace in family in recreation in sports or in hobbies it was almost as if the hole in his heart was so large that even the love of a family without work could not fill it as his spirits sagged his body deteriorated until i believe he slowly brought about his own death in those last years he said he was so sad watching the american people look toward a new president and forgetting him he spoke with immense sadness in his voice saying maybe he should have spent more time with his children and their children in turn but it was too late despite all that power all that wealth he was alone when he finally died -- his ultimate terror realized so as for that third sphere of play which he never had learned to enjoy i 've learned over the years that even this sphere requires a commitment of time and energy -- enough so that a hobby a sport a love of music or art or literature or any form of recreation can provide true pleasure relaxation and replenishment so deep for instance was abraham lincoln 's love of shakespeare that he made time to spend more than a hundred nights in the theater even during those dark days of the war he said when the lights went down and a shakespeare play came on for a few precious hours he could imagine himself back in prince hal 's time but an even more important form of relaxation for him that lyndon johnson never could enjoy was a love of -- somehow -- humor and feeling out what hilarious parts of life can produce as a sidelight to the sadness he once said that he laughed so he did not cry that a good story for him was better than a drop of whiskey his storytelling powers had first been recognized when he was on the circuit in illinois the lawyers and the judges would travel from one county courthouse to the other and when anyone was knowing lincoln was in town they would come from miles around to listen to him tell stories he would stand with his back against a fire and entertain the crowd for hours with his winding tales and all these stories became part of his memory bank so he could call on them whenever he needed to and they 're not quite what you might expect from our marble monument one of his favorite stories for example had to do with the revolutionary war hero ethan allen and as lincoln told the story mr. allen went to britain after the war and the british people were still upset about losing the revolution so they decided to embarrass him a little bit by putting a huge picture of general washington in the only outhouse where he 'd have to encounter it they figured he 'd be upset about the indignity of george washington being in an outhouse but he came out of the outhouse not upset at all and so they said " well did you see george washington in there " " oh yes " he said " perfectly appropriate place for him " " what do you mean " they said " well " he said " there 's nothing to make an englishman shit faster than the sight of general george washington " so you can imagine if you are in the middle of a tense cabinet meeting -- and he had hundreds of these stories -- you would have to relax so between his nightly treks to the theater his story telling and his extraordinary sense of humor and his love of quoting shakespeare and poetry he found that form of play which carried him through his days in my own life i shall always be grateful for having found a form of play in my irrational love of baseball which allows me from the beginning of spring training to the end of the fall to have something to occupy my mind and heart other than my work it all began when i was only six years old and my father taught me that mysterious art of keeping score while listening to baseball games -- so that when he went to work in new york during the day i could record for him the history of that afternoon 's brooklyn dodgers game now when you 're only six years old and your father comes home every single night and listens to you -- as i now realize that i in excruciating detail recounted every single play of every inning of the game that had just taken place that afternoon but he made me feel i was telling him a fabulous story it makes you think there 's something magic about history to keep your father 's attention in fact i 'm convinced i learned the narrative art from those nightly sessions with my father because at first i 'd be so excited i would blurt out " the dodgers won ! " or " the dodgers lost ! " which took much of the drama of this two-hour telling away so i finally learned you had to tell a story from beginning to middle to end i must say so fervent was my love of the old brooklyn dodgers in those days that i had to confess in my first confession two sins that related to baseball the first occurred because the dodgers ' catcher roy campanella came to my hometown of rockville centre long island just as i was in preparation for my first holy communion and i was so excited -- first person i 'd ever see outside of ebbets field but it so happened he was speaking in a protestant church when you are brought up as a catholic you think that if you ever set foot in a protestant church you 'll be struck dead at the threshold so i went to my father in tears " what are we going to do " he said " do n't worry he 's speaking in a parish hall we 're sitting in folding chairs he 's talking about sportsmanship it 's not a sin " but as i left that night i was certain that somehow i 'd traded the life of my everlasting soul for this one night with roy campanella and there were no indulgences around that i could buy so i had this sin on my soul when i went to my first confession i told the priest right away he said " no problem it was n't a religious service " but then unfortunately he said " and what else my child " and then came my second sin i tried to sandwich it in between talking too much in church wishing harm to others being mean to my sisters and he said " to whom did you wish harm " and i had to say that i wished that various new york yankees players would break arms legs and ankles -- -- so that the brooklyn dodgers could win their first world series he said " how often do you make these horrible wishes " and i had to say every night when i said my prayers so he said " look i 'll tell you something i love the brooklyn dodgers as you do but i promise you some day they will win fairly and squarely you do not need to wish harm on others to make it happen " " oh yes " i said but luckily my first confession -- to a baseball-loving priest ! well though my father died of a sudden heart attack when i was still in my 20s before i had gotten married and had my three sons i have passed his memory -- as well as his love of baseball -- on to my boys though when the dodgers abandoned us to come to l.a. i lost faith in baseball until i moved to boston and became an irrational red socks fan and i must say even now when i sit with my sons with our season tickets i can sometimes close my eyes against the sun and imagine myself a young girl once more in the presence of my father watching the players of my youth on the grassy fields below : jackie robinson roy campanella pee wee reese and duke snider i must say there is magic in these moments when i open my eyes and i see my sons in the place where my father once sat i feel an invisible loyalty and love linking my sons to the grandfather whose face they never had a chance to see but whose heart and soul they have come to know through all the stories i have told which is why in the end i shall always be grateful for this curious love of history allowing me to spend a lifetime looking back into the past allowing me to learn from these large figures about the struggle for meaning for life allowing me to believe that the private people we have loved and lost in our families and the public figures we have respected in our history just as abraham lincoln wanted to believe really can live on so long as we pledge to tell and to retell the stories of their lives thank you for letting me be that storyteller today thank you i want to talk today about -- i 've been asked to take the long view and i 'm going to tell you what i think are the three biggest problems for humanity from this long point of view some of these have already been touched upon by other speakers which is encouraging it seems that there 's not just one person who thinks that these problems are important the first is -- death is a big problem if you look at the statistics the odds are not very favorable to us so far most people who have lived have also died roughly 90 percent of everybody who has been alive has died by now so the annual death rate adds up to 150,000 -- sorry the daily death rate -- 150,000 people per day which is a huge number by any standard the annual death rate then becomes 56 million if we just look at the single biggest cause of death -- aging -- it accounts for roughly two-thirds of all human people who die that adds up to an annual death toll of greater than the population of canada sometimes we do n't see a problem because either it 's too familiar or it 's too big ca n't see it because it 's too big i think death might be both too familiar and too big for most people to see it as a problem once you think about it you see this is not statistical points ; these are -- let 's see how far have i talked i 've talked for three minutes so that would be roughly 324 people have died since i 've begun speaking people like -- it 's roughly the population in this room has just died now the human cost of that is obvious once you start to think about it -- the suffering the loss -- it 's also economically enormously wasteful i just look at the information and knowledge and experience that is lost due to natural causes of death in general and aging in particular suppose we approximated one person with one book now of course this is an underestimation a person 's lifetime of learning and experience is a lot more than you could put into a single book but let 's suppose we did this 52 million people die of natural causes each year corresponds then to 52 million volumes destroyed library of congress holds 18 million volumes we are upset about the burning of the library of alexandria it 's one of the great cultural tragedies that we remember even today but this is the equivalent of three libraries of congress -- burnt down forever lost -- each year so that 's the first big problem and i wish godspeed to aubrey de grey and other people like him to try to do something about this as soon as possible existential risk -- the second big problem existential risk is a threat to human survival or to the long-term potential of our species now why do i say that this is a big problem well let 's first look at the probability -- and this is very very difficult to estimate -- but there have been only four studies on this in recent years which is surprising you would think that it would be of some interest to try to find out more about this given that the stakes are so big but it 's a very neglected area but there have been four studies -- one by john lesley wrote a book on this he estimated a probability that we will fail to survive the current century : 50 percent similarly the astronomer royal whom we heard speak yesterday also has a 50 percent probability estimate another author does n't give any numerical estimate but says the probability is significant that it will fail i wrote a long paper on this i said assigning a less than 20 percent probability would be a mistake in light of the current evidence we have now the exact figures here we should take with a big grain of salt but there seems to be a consensus that the risk is substantial everybody who has looked at this and studied it agrees now if we think about what just reducing the probability of human extinction by just one percentage point -- not very much -- so that 's equivalent to 60 million lives saved if we just count the currently living people the current generation now one percent of six billion people is equivalent to 60 million so that 's a large number if we were to take into account future generations that will never come into existence if we blow ourselves up then the figure becomes astronomical if we could eventually colonize a chunk of the universe -- the virgo supercluster -- maybe it will take us 100 million years to get there but if we go extinct we never will then even a one percentage point reduction in the extinction risk could be equivalent to this astronomical number -- 10 to the power of 32 so if you take into account future generations as much as our own every other moral imperative of philanthropic cost just becomes irrelevant the only thing you should focus on would be to reduce existential risk because even the tiniest decrease in existential risk would just overwhelm any other benefit you could hope to achieve and even if you just look at the current people and ignore the potential that would be lost if we went extinct it should still have a high priority now let me spend the rest of my time on the third big problem because it 's more subtle and perhaps difficult to grasp think about some time in your life -- some people might never have experienced it -- but some people there are just those moments that you have experienced where life was fantastic it might have been at the moment of some great creative inspiration you might have had when you just entered this flow stage or when you understood something you had never done before or perhaps in the ecstasy of romantic love or an aesthetic experience -- a sunset or a great piece of art every once in a while we have these moments and we realize just how good life can be when it 's at its best and you wonder why ca n't it be like that all the time you just want to cling onto this and then of course it drifts back into ordinary life and the memory fades and it 's really difficult to recall in a normal frame of mind just how good life can be at its best or how bad it can be at its worst the third big problem is that life is n't usually as wonderful as it could be i think that 's a big big problem it 's easy to say what we do n't want here are a number of things that we do n't want -- illness involuntary death unnecessary suffering cruelty stunted growth memory loss ignorance absence of creativity suppose we fixed these things -- we did something about all of these we were very successful we got rid of all of these things we might end up with something like this which is -- i mean it 's a heck of a lot better than that but is this really the best we can dream of is this the best we can do or is it possible to find something a little bit more inspiring to work towards and if we think about this i think it 's very clear that there are ways in which we could change things not just by eliminating negatives but adding positives on my wish list at least would be : much longer healthier lives greater subjective well-being enhanced cognitive capacities more knowledge and understanding unlimited opportunity for personal growth beyond our current biological limits better relationships an unbounded potential for spiritual moral and intellectual development if we want to achieve this what in the world would have to change and this is the answer -- we would have to change not just the world around us but we ourselves not just the way we think about the world but the way we are -- our very biology human nature would have to change now when we think about changing human nature the first thing that comes to mind are these human modification technologies -- growth hormone therapy cosmetic surgery stimulants like ritalin adderall anti-depressants anabolic steroids artificial hearts it 's a pretty pathetic list they do great things for a few people who suffer from some specific condition but for most people they do n't really transform what it is to be human and they also all seem a little bit -- most people have this instinct that well sure there needs to be anti-depressants for the really depressed people but there 's a kind of queasiness that these are unnatural in some way it 's worth recalling that there are a lot of other modification technologies and enhancement technologies that we use we have skin enhancements clothing as far as i can see all of you are users of this enhancement technology in this room so that 's a great thing mood modifiers have been used from time immemorial -- caffeine alcohol nicotine immune system enhancement vision enhancement anesthetics -- we take that very much for granted but just think about how great progress that is -- like having an operation before anesthetics was not fun contraceptives cosmetics and brain reprogramming techniques -- that sounds ominous but the distinction between what is a technology -- a gadget would be the archetype -- and other ways of changing and rewriting human nature is quite subtle so if you think about what it means to learn arithmetic or to learn to read you 're actually literally rewriting your own brain you 're changing the microstructure of your brain as you go along so in a broad sense we do n't need to think about technology as only little gadgets like these things here but even institutions and techniques psychological methods and so forth forms of organization can have a profound impact on human nature looking ahead there is a range of technologies that are almost certain to be developed sooner or later we are very ignorant about what the time scale for these things are but they all are consistent with everything we know about physical laws laws of chemistry etc it 's possible to assume setting aside a possibility of catastrophe that sooner or later we will develop all of these and even just a couple of these would be enough to transform the human condition so let 's look at some of the dimensions of human nature that seem to leave room for improvement health span is a big and urgent thing because if you 're not alive then all the other things will be to little avail intellectual capacity -- let 's take that box which falls into a lot of different sub-categories : memory concentration mental energy intelligence empathy these are really great things part of the reason why we value these traits is that they make us better at competing with other people -- they 're positional goods but part of the reason -- and that 's the reason why we have ethical ground for pursuing these -- is that they 're also intrinsically valuable it 's just better to be able to understand more of the world around you and the people that you are communicating with and to remember what you have learned modalities and special faculties now the human mind is not a single unitary information processor but it has a lot of different special evolved modules that do specific things for us if you think about what we normally take as giving life a lot of its meaning -- music humor eroticism spirituality aesthetics nurturing and caring gossip chatting with people -- all of these very likely are enabled by a special circuitry that we humans have but that you could have another intelligent life form that lacks these we 're just lucky that we have the requisite neural machinery to process music and to appreciate it and enjoy it all of these would enable in principle -- be amenable to enhancement some people have a better musical ability and ability to appreciate music than others have it 's also interesting to think about what other things are -- so if these all enabled great values why should we think that evolution has happened to provide us with all the modalities we would need to engage with other values that there might be imagine a species that just did n't have this neural machinery for processing music and they would just stare at us with bafflement when we spend time listening to a beautiful performance like the one we just heard -- because of people making stupid movements and they would be really irritated and would n't see what we were up to but maybe they have another faculty something else that would seem equally irrational to us but they actually tap into some great possible value there but we are just literally deaf to that kind of value so we could think of adding on different new sensory capacities and mental faculties bodily functionality and morphology and affective self-control greater subjective well-being be able to switch between relaxation and activity -- being able to go slow when you need to do that and to speed up able to switch back and forth more easily would be a neat thing to be able to do -- easier to achieve the flow state when you 're totally immersed in something you are doing conscientiousness and sympathy the ability to -- it 's another interesting application that would have large social ramification perhaps if you could actually choose to preserve your romantic attachments to one person undiminished through time so that would n't have to -- love would never have to fade if you did n't want it to that 's probably not all that difficult it might just be a simple hormone or something that could do this it 's been done in voles you can engineer a prairie vole to become monogamous when it 's naturally polygamous it 's just a single gene might be more complicated in humans but perhaps not that much this is the last picture that i want to -- now we 've got to use the laser pointer a possible mode of being here would be a way of life -- a way of being experiencing thinking seeing interacting with the world down here in this little corner here we have the little sub-space of this larger space that is accessible to human beings -- beings with our biological capacities it 's a part of the space that 's accessible to animals ; since we are animals we are a subset of that and then you can imagine some enhancements of human capacities there would be different modes of being you could experience if you were able to stay alive for say 200 years then you could live sorts of lives and accumulate wisdoms that are just not possible for humans as we currently are so then you move off to this larger sphere of " human + " and you could continue that process and eventually explore a lot of this larger space of possible modes of being now why is that a good thing to do well we know already that in this little human circle there there are these enormously wonderful and worthwhile modes of being -- human life at its best is wonderful we have no reason to believe that within this much much larger space there would not also be extremely worthwhile modes of being perhaps ones that would be way beyond our wildest ability even to imagine or dream about and so to fix this third problem i think we need -- slowly carefully with ethical wisdom and constraint -- develop the means that enable us to go out in this larger space and explore it and find the great values that might hide there thanks you might be wondering why i 'm wearing sunglasses and one answer to that is because i 'm here to talk about glamour so we all think we know what glamour is here it is it 's glamorous movie stars like marlene dietrich and it comes in a male form too -- very glamorous not only can he shoot drive drink -- you know he drinks wine there actually is a little wine in there -- and of course always wears a tuxedo but i think that glamour actually has a much broader meaning -- one that is true for the movie stars and the fictional characters but also comes in other forms a magazine well it 's certainly not this one this is the least glamorous magazine on the newsstand -- it 's all about sex tips sex tips are not glamorous and drew barrymore for all her wonderful charm is not glamorous either but there is a glamour of industry this is margaret bourke-white 's -- one of her pictures she did fantastic glamorous pictures of steel mills and paper mills and all kinds of glamorous industrial places and there 's the mythic glamour of the garage entrepreneur this is the hewlett-packard garage we know everyone who starts a business in a garage ends up founding hewlett-packard there 's the glamour of physics what could be more glamorous than understanding the entire universe grand unification and by the way it helps if you 're brian greene -- he has other kinds of glamour and there is of course this glamour this is very very glamorous : the glamour of outer space -- and not the alien-style glamour but the nice clean early '60s version so what do we mean by glamour well one thing you can do if you want to know what glamour means is you can look in the dictionary and it actually helps a lot more if you look in a very old dictionary in this case the 1913 dictionary because for centuries glamour had a very particular meaning and the word was actually used differently from the way we think of it you had " a " glamour it was n't glamour as a quality -- you " cast a glamour " glamour was a literal magic spell not a metaphorical one the way we use it today but a literal magic spell associated with witches and gypsies and to some extent celtic magic and over the years around the turn of the 20th century it started to take on this other kind of deception -- this definition for any artificial interest in or association with an object through which it appears delusively magnified or glorified but still glamour is an illusion glamour is a magic spell and there 's something dangerous about glamour throughout most of history when the witches cast a magic spell on you it was not in your self-interest -- it was to get you to act against your interest well of course in the 20th century glamour came to have this different meaning associated with hollywood and this is hedy lamarr hedy lamarr said " anyone can look glamorous all you have to do is sit there and look stupid " but in fact with all due respect to hedy -- about whom we 'll hear more later -- there 's a lot more to it there was a tremendous amount of technical achievement associated with creating this hollywood glamour there were scores of retouchers and lighting experts and make-up experts you can go to the museum of hollywood history in hollywood and see max factor 's special rooms that he painted different colors depending on the complexion of the star he was going to make up so you 've got this highly stylized portrait of something that was not entirely of this earth -- it was a portrait of a star and actually we see glamorized photos of stars all the time -- they call them false color glamour is a form of falsification but falsification to achieve a particular purpose it may be to illuminate the star ; it may be to sell a film and it involves a great deal of technique it 's not -- glamour is not something -- you do n't wake up in the morning glamorous i do n't care who you are even nicole kidman does n't wake up in the morning glamorous there is a process of " idealization glorification and dramatization " and it 's not just the case for people glamour does n't have to be people architectural photography -- julius schulman who has talked about transfiguration took this fabulous famous picture of the kauffman house architectural photography is extremely glamorous it puts you into this special special world this is alex ross 's comic book art which appears to be extremely realistic as part of his style is he gives you a kind of realism in his comic art except that light does n't work this way in the real world when you stack people in rows the ones in the background look smaller than the ones in the foreground -- but not in the world of glamour what glamour is all about -- i took this from a blurb in the table of contents of new york magazine which was telling us that glamour is back -- glamour is all about transcending the everyday and i think that that 's starting to get at what the core that combines all sorts of glamour is this is filippino lippi 's 1543 portrait of saint apollonia and i do n't know who she is either but this is the [ 16th ] century equivalent of a supermodel it 's a very glamorous portrait why is it glamorous it 's glamorous first because she is beautiful -- but that does not make you glamorous that only makes you beautiful she is graceful she is mysterious and she is transcendent and those are the central qualities of glamour you do n't see her eyes ; they 're looking downward she 's not looking away from you exactly but you have to mentally imagine her world she 's encouraging you to contemplate this higher world to which she belongs where she can be completely tranquil while holding the iron instruments of her death by torture mel gibson 's " passion of the christ " -- not glamorous that 's glamour : that 's michelangelo 's " pieta " where mary is the same age as jesus and they 're both awfully happy and pleasant glamour invites us to live in a different world it has to simultaneously be mysterious a little bit distant -- that 's why often in these glamour shots the person is not looking at the audience it 's why sunglasses are glamorous -- but also not so far above us that we ca n't identify with the person in some sense there has to be something like us so as i say in religious art you know god is not glamorous god can not be glamorous because god is omnipotent omniscient -- too far above us and yet you will see in religious art saints or the virgin mary will often be portrayed -- not always -- in glamorous forms as i said earlier glamour does not have to be about people but it has to have this transcendent quality what is it about superman aside from alex ross 's style which is very glamorous one thing about superman is he makes you believe that a man can fly glamour is all about transcending this world and getting to an idealized perfect place and this is one reason that modes of transportation tend to be extremely glamorous the less experience we have with them the more glamorous they are so you can do a glamorized picture of a car but you ca n't do a glamorized picture of traffic you can do a glamorized picture of an airplane but not the inside the notion is that it 's going to transport you and the story is not about you know the guy in front of you in the airplane who has this nasty little kid or the big cough the story is about where you 're arriving or thinking about where you 're arriving and this sense of being transported is one reason that we have glamour styling this sort of streamlining styling is not just glamorous because we associate it with movies of that period but because in it 's streamlining it transports us from the everyday the same thing -- arches are very glamorous arches with stained glass -- even more glamorous staircases that curve away from you are glamorous i happen to find that particular staircase picture very glamorous because to me it captures the whole promise of the academic contemplative life -- but maybe that 's because i went to princeton anyway skylines are super glamorous city streets -- not so glamorous you know when you get actually to this town it has reality the horizon the open road is very very glamorous there are few things more glamorous than the horizon -- except possibly multiple horizons of course here you do n't feel the cold or the heat -- you just see the possibilities in order to pull glamour off you need this renaissance quality of sprezzatura which is a term coined by castiglione in his book " the book of the courtier " there 's the not-glamorous version of what it looks like today after a few centuries and sprezzatura is the art that conceals art it makes things look effortless you do n't think about how nicole kidman is maneuvering that dress -- she just looks completely natural and i remember reading after the lara croft movies how angelina jolie would go home completely black and blue of course they covered that with make-up because lara croft did all those same stunts -- but she does n't get black and blue because she has sprezzatura " to conceal all art and make whatever is done or said appear to be without effort " : and this is one of the critical aspects of glamour glamour is about editing how do you create the sense of transcendence the sense of evoking a perfect world the sense of you know life could be better i could join this -- i could be a perfect person i could join this perfect world we do n't tell you all the grubby details now this was kindly lent to me by jeff bezos from last year this is underneath jeff 's desk this is what the real world of computers lamps electrical appliances of all kinds looks like but if you look in a catalog -- particularly a catalog of modern beautiful objects for your home -- it looks like this there are no cords look next time you get these catalogs in your mail -- you can usually figure out where they hid the cord but there 's always this illusion that if you buy this lamp you will live in a world without cords and the same thing is true of if you buy this laptop or you buy this computer -- and even in these wireless eras you do n't get to live in the world without cords you have to have mystery and you have to have grace and there she is -- grace this is the most glamorous picture i think ever part of the thing is that in " rear window " the question is is she too glamorous to live in his world and the answer is no but of course it 's really just a movie here 's hedy lamarr again and you know this kind of head covering is extremely glamorous because like sunglasses it conceals and reveals at the same time translucence is glamorous -- that 's why all these people wear pearls it 's why barware is glamorous glamour is translucent -- not transparent not opaque it invites us into the world but it does n't give us a completely clear picture and i think if grace kelly is the most glamorous person maybe a spiral staircase with glass block may be the most glamorous interior shot because a spiral staircase is incredibly glamorous it has that sense of going up and away and yet you never think about how you would really trip if you were -- particularly going down and of course glass block has that sense of translucence so this session 's supposed to be about pure pleasure but glamour 's really partly about meaning all individuals and all cultures have ideals that can not possibly be realized in reality they have contradictions they uphold principles that are incommensurable with each other -- whatever it is -- and yet these ideals give meaning and purpose to our lives as cultures and as individuals and the way we deal with that is we displace them -- we put them into a golden world an imagined world an age of heroes the world to come and in the life of an individual we often associate that with some object the white picket fence the perfect house the perfect kitchen -- no bills on the counter in the perfect kitchen you know you buy that viking range this is what your kitchen will look like the perfect love life -- symbolized by the perfect necklace the perfect diamond ring the perfect getaway in your perfect car this is an interior design firm that is literally called utopia the perfect office -- again no cords as far as i can tell and certainly no it does n't look a thing like my office i mean there 's no paper on the desk we want this golden world and some people get rich enough and if they have their ideals -- in a sort of domestic sense they get to acquire their perfect world dean koontz built this fabulous home theater which is -- i do n't think accidentally -- in art deco style that symbolizes this sense of being safe and at home this is not always good because what is your perfect world what is your ideal and also what has been edited out is it something important " the matrix " is a movie that is all about glamour i could do a whole talk on " the matrix " and glamour it was criticized for glamorizing violence because look -- sunglasses and those long coats and of course they could walk up walls and do all these kinds of things that are impossible in the real world this is another margaret bourke-white photo this is from soviet union attractive i mean look how happy the people are and good-looking too you know we 're marching toward utopia i 'm not a fan of peta but i think this is a great ad because what they 're doing is they 're saying your coat 's not so glamorous what 's been edited out is something important but actually what 's even more important than remembering what 's been edited out is thinking are the ideals good because glamour can be very totalitarian and deceptive and it 's not just a matter of glamorizing cleaning your floor this is from " triumph of the will " -- brilliant editing to cut together things there 's a glamour shot national socialism is all about glamour it was a very aesthetic ideology it was all about cleaning up germany and the west and the world and ridding it of anything unglamorous so glamour can be dangerous i think glamour has a genuine appeal has a genuine value i 'm not against glamour but there 's a kind of wonder in the stuff that gets edited away in the cords of life and there is both a way to avoid the dangers of glamour and a way to broaden your appreciation of it and that 's to take isaac mizrahi 's advice and confront the manipulation of it all and sort of admit that manipulation is something that we enjoy but also enjoy how it happens and here 's hedy lamarr she 's very glamorous but you know she invented spread-spectrum technology so she 's even more glamorous if you know that she really was n't stupid even though she thought she could look stupid david hockney talks about how the appreciation of this very glamorous painting is heightened if you think about the fact that it takes two weeks to paint this splash which only took a fraction of a second to happen there is a book out in the bookstore -- it 's called " symphony in steel " and it 's about the stuff that 's hidden under the skin of the disney center and that has a fascination it 's not necessarily glamorous but unveiling the glamour has an appeal there 's a wonderful book called " crowns " that 's all these glamour pictures of black women in their church hats and there 's a quote from one of these women and she talks about " as a little girl i 'd admire women at church with beautiful hats they looked like beautiful dolls like they 'd just stepped out of a magazine but i also knew how hard they worked all week sometimes under those hats there 's a lot of joy and a lot of sorrow " and actually you get more appreciation for glamour when you realize what went into creating it thank you you know we 're going to do things a little differently i 'm not going to show you a presentation i 'm going to talk to you and at the same time we 're going to look at just images from a photo stream that is pretty close to live of things that -- snapshots from second life so hopefully this will be fascinating you can -- i can compete for your attention with the strange pictures that you see on screen that come from there i thought i 'd talk a little bit about some just big ideas about this and then get john back out here so we can talk interactively a little bit more and think and ask questions you know i guess the first question is why build a virtual world at all and i think the answer to that is always going to be at least driven to a certain extent by the people initially crazy enough to start the project you know so i can give you a little bit of first background just on me and what moved me as a -- really going back as far as a teenager and then an adult to actually try and build this kind of thing i was a very creative kid who read a lot and got into electronics first and then later programming computers when i was really young i was just always trying to make things i was just obsessed with taking things apart and building things and just anything i could do with my hands or with wood or electronics or metal or anything else and so for example -- and it 's a great second life thing -- i had a bedroom and every kid you know as a teenager has got his bedroom he retreats to -- but i wanted my door i thought it would be cool if my door went up rather than opened like on star trek i thought it would be neat to do that and so i got up in the ceiling and i cut through the ceiling joists much to my parents ' delight and put the door you know being pulled up through the ceiling i built -- i put a garage-door opener up in the attic that would pull this door up you can imagine the amount of time that it took me to do this to the house and the displeasure of my parents the thing that was always striking to me was that we as people could have so many really amazing ideas about things we 'd like to do but are so often unable in the real world to actually do those things -- to actually cobble together the materials and go through the actual execution phase of building something that you imagine from a design perspective and so for me i know that when the internet came around and i was doing computer programming and just you know just generally trying to run my own little company and figure out what to do with the internet and with computers i was just immediately struck by how the ultimate thing that you would really want to do with the internet and with computers would be to use the internet and connected computers to simulate a world to sort of recreate the laws of physics and the rules of how things went together -- the sort of -- the idea of atoms and how to make things and do that inside a computer so that we could all get in there and make stuff and so for me that was the thing that was so enticing i just wanted this place where you could build things and so i think you see that in the genesis of what has happened with second life and i think it 's important i also think that more generally the use of the internet and technology as a kind of a space between us for creativity and design is a general trend it is a -- sort of a great human progress technology is just generally being used to allow us to create in as shared and social a way as possible and i think that second life and virtual worlds more generally represent the best we can do to achieve that right now you know another way to look at that and related to the content and you know thinking about space is to connect sort of virtual worlds to space i thought that might be a fun thing to talk about for a second if you think about going into space it 's a fascinating thing so many movies so many kids we all sort of dream about exploring space now why is that stop for a moment and ask why that conceit why do we as people want to do that i think there 's a couple of things it 's what we see in the movies -- you know it 's this dream that we all share one is that if you went into space you 'd be able to begin again in some sense you would become someone else in that journey because there would n't be -- you 'd leave society and life as you know it behind and so inevitably you would transform yourself -- irreversibly in all likelihood -- as you began this exploration and then the second thing is that there 's this tangible sense that if you travel far enough you can find out there -- oh yeah -- you have no idea what you 're going to find once you get there into space it 's going to be different than here and in fact it 's going to be so different than what we see here on earth that anything is going to be possible so that 's kind of the idea -- we as humans crave the idea of creating a new identity and going into a place where anything is possible and i think that if you really sit and think about it virtual worlds and where we 're going with more and more computing technology represent essentially the likely really tactically possible version of space exploration we are moved by the idea of virtual worlds because like space they allow us to reinvent ourselves and they contain anything and everything and probably anything could happen there you know to give you a size idea about scale you know comparing space to second life most people do n't realize kind of -- and then this is just like the internet in the early '90s in fact second life virtual worlds are a lot like the internet in the early '90s today : everybody 's very excited there 's a lot of hype and excitement about one idea or the next from moment to moment and then there 's despair and everybody thinks the whole thing 's not going to work everything that 's happening with second life and more broadly with virtual worlds all happened in the early '90s we always play a game at the office where you can take any article and find the same article where you just replace the words " second life " with " web " and " virtual reality " with " internet " you can find exactly the same articles written about everything that people are observing to give you an idea of scale second life is about 20,000 cpus at this point it 's about 20,000 computers connected together in three facilities in the united states right now that are simulating this virtual space and the virtual space itself -- there 's about 250,000 people a day that are wandering around in there so the kind of active population is something like a smallish city the space itself is about 10 times the size of san francisco and it 's about as densely built out so it gives you an idea of scale now it 's expanding very rapidly -- about five percent a month or so right now in terms of new servers being added and so of course radically unlike the real world and like the internet the whole thing is expanding very very quickly and historically exponentially so that sort of space exploration thing is matched up here by the amount of content that 's in there and i think that amount is critical it was critical with the virtual world that it be this space of truly infinite possibility we 're very sensitive to that as humans you know you know when you see it you know when you can do anything in a space and you know when you ca n't second life today is this 20,000 machines and it 's about 100 million or so user-created objects where you know an object would be something like this possibly interactive tens of millions of them are thinking all the time ; they have code attached to them so it 's a really large world already in terms of the amount of stuff that 's there and that 's very important if anybody plays like world of warcraft world of warcraft comes on like four dvds second life by comparison has about 100 terabytes of user-created data making it about 25,000 times larger so again like the internet compared to aol and the sort of chat rooms and content on aol at the time what 's happening here is something very different because the sheer scale of what people can do when they 're enabled to do anything they want is pretty amazing the last big thought is that it is almost certainly true that whatever this is going to evolve into is going to be bigger in total usage than the web itself and let me justify that with two statements generically what we use the web for is to organize exchange create and consume information it 's kind of like irene talking about google being data-driven i 'd say i kind of think about the world as being information everything that we interact with all the experiences that we have is kind of us flowing through a sea of information and interacting with it in different ways the web puts information in the form of text and images the topology the geography of the web is text-to-text links for the most part that 's one way of organizing information but there are two things about the way you access information in a virtual world that i think are the important ways that they 're very different and much better than what we 've been able to do to date with the web the first is that as i said the -- well the first difference for virtual worlds is that information is presented to you in the virtual world using the most powerful iconic symbols that you can possibly use with human beings so for example c-h-a-i-r is the english word for that but a picture of this is a universal symbol everybody knows what it means there 's no need to translate it it 's also more memorable if i show you that picture and i show you c-h-a-i-r on a piece of paper you can do tests that show that you 'll remember that i was talking about a chair a couple of days later a lot better so when you organize information using the symbols of our memory using the most common symbols that we 've been immersed in all our lives you maximally both excite stimulate are able to remember transfer and manipulate data and so virtual worlds are the best way for us to essentially organize and experience information and i think that 's something that people have talked about for 20 years -- you know that 3d that lifelike environments are really important in some magical way to us but the second thing -- and i think this one is less obvious -- is that the experience of creating consuming exploring that information is in the virtual world implicitly and inherently social you are always there with other people and we as humans are social creatures and must or are aided by or enjoy more the consumption of information in the presence of others it 's essential to us you ca n't escape it when you 're on amazon.com and you 're looking for digital cameras or whatever you 're on there right now when you 're on the site with like 5,000 other people but you ca n't talk to them you ca n't just turn to the people that are browsing digital cameras on the same page as you and ask them " hey have you seen one of these before because i 'm thinking about buying it " that experience of like shopping together just as a simple example is an example of how as social creatures we want to experience information in that way so that second point that we inherently experience information together or want to experience it together is critical to essentially kind of this trend of where we 're going to use technology to connect us and so i think again that it 's likely that in the next decade or so these virtual worlds are going to be the most common way as human beings that we kind of use the electronics of the internet if you will to be together to consume information you know mapping in india -- that 's such a great example maybe the solution there involves talking to other people in real time asking for advice rather than any possible way that you could just statically organize a map so i think that 's another big point i think that wherever this is all going whether it 's second life or its descendants or something broader that happens all around the world at a lot of different points -- this is what we 're going to see the internet used for and total traffic and total unique users is going to invert so that the web and its bibliographic set of text and graphical information is going to become a tool or a part of that consumption pattern but the pattern itself is going to happen mostly in this type of an environment big idea but i think highly defensible so let me stop there and bring john back and maybe we can just have a longer conversation thank you john that 's great john hockenberry : why is the creation the impulse to create second life not a utopian impulse like for example in the 19th century any number of works of literature that imagined alternative worlds were explicitly utopian philip rosedale : i think that 's great that 's such a deep question yeah is a virtual world likely to be a utopia would be one way i 'd say it the answer is no and i think the reason why is because the web itself as a good example is profoundly bottoms-up that idea of infinite possibility that magic of anything can happen only happens in an environment where you really know that there 's a fundamental freedom at the level of the individual actor at the level of the lego blocks if you will that make up the virtual world you have to have that level of freedom and so i 'm often asked that you know is there a kind of utopian or is there a utopian tendency to second life and things like it that you would create a world that has a grand scheme to it those top-down schemes are alienating to just about everybody even if you mean well when you build them and what 's more human society when it 's controlled when you set out a grand scheme of rules a new way of people interacting or a new way of laying out a city or whatever that stuff historically has never scaled much beyond you know -- i always laughingly say -- the mall of america you know which is like the largest piece of centrally designed architecture that you know has been built jh : the kremlin was pretty big pr : the kremlin yeah that 's true the whole complex jh : give me a story of a tool you created at the beginning in second life that you were pretty sure people would want to use in the creation of their avatars or in communicating that people actually in practice said no i 'm not interested in that at all and name something that you did n't come up with that almost immediately people began to demand pr : i 'm sure i can think of multiple examples of both of those one of my favorites i had this feature that i built into second life -- i was really passionate about it it was an ability to kind of walk up close to somebody and have a more private conversation but it was n't instant messaging because you had to sort of befriend somebody it was just this idea that you could kind of have a private chat i just remember it was one of those examples of data-driven design i thought it was such a good idea from my perspective and it was just absolutely never used and we ultimately -- i think we 've now turned it off if i remember we finally gave up took it out of the code but more generally you know one other example i think about this which is great relative to the utopian idea second life originally had 16 simulators it now has 20,000 so when it only had 16 it was only about as big as this college campus and we had -- we zoned it you know : we put a nightclub we put a disco where you could dance and then we had a place where you could fight with guns if you wanted to and we had another place that was like a boardwalk kind of a coney island and we laid out the zoning but of course people could build all around it however they wanted to and what was so amazing right from the start was that the idea that we had put out in the zoning concept basically was instantly and thoroughly ignored and like two months into the whole thing -- which is really a small amount of time even in second life time -- i remember the users the people who were then using second life the residents came to me and said we want to buy the disco -- because i had built it -- we want to buy that land and raze it and put houses on it and i sold it to them -- i mean we transferred ownership and they had a big party and blew up the entire building and i remember that that was just so telling you know that you did n't know exactly what was going to happen when you think about stuff that people have built that 's popular -- jh : cbgb 's has to close eventually you know that 's the rule pr : exactly and it -- but it closed on day one basically in internet time you know an example of something -- pregnancy you can have a baby in second life this is done entirely using kind of the tools that are built into second life so the innate concept of becoming pregnant and having a baby of course -- second life is at the platform level at the level of the company -- at linden lab -- second life has no game properties to it whatsoever there is no attempt to structure the experience to make it utopian in that sense that we put into it so of course we never would have put a mechanism for having babies or you know taking two avatars and merging them or something but people built the ability to have babies and care for babies as a purchasable experience that you can have in second life and so -- i mean that 's a pretty fascinating example of you know what goes on in the overall economy and of course the existence of an economy is another idea i did n't talk about it but it 's a critical feature when people are given the opportunity to create in the world there 's really two things they want one is fair ownership of the things they create and then the second one is -- if they feel like it and they 're not going to do it in every case but in many they are -- they want to actually be able to sell that creation as a way of providing for their own livelihood true on the web -- also true in second life and so the existence of an economy is critical jh : questions for philip rosedale right here jh : the observation is philip has been accused of looking like a character an avatar in second life respond and then we 'll get the rest of your question pr : but i do n't look like my avatar how many people here know what my avatar looks like that 's probably not very many jh : are you ripping off somebody else 's avatar with that sort of -- pr : no no i did n't one of the other guys at work had a fantastic avatar -- a female avatar -- that i used to be once in a while but my avatar is a guy wearing chaps spiky hair -- spikier than this kind of orange hair handlebar mustache kind of a village people sort of a character so very cool jh : and your question jh : the question is there appears to be a lack of cultural fine-tuning in second life it does n't seem to have its own culture and the sort of differences that exist in the real world are n't translated into the second life map pr : well first of all we 're very early so this has only been going on for a few years and so part of what we see is the same evolution of human behavior that you see in emerging societies so a fair criticism -- is what it is -- of second life today is that it 's more like the wild west than it is like rome from a cultural standpoint that said the evolution of and the nuanced interaction that creates culture is happening at 10 times the speed of the real world and in an environment where if you walk into a bar in second life 65 percent of the people there are not in the united states and in fact are speaking their you know various and different languages in fact one of the ways to make money in second life is to make really cool translators that you drag onto your body and they basically kind of pop up on your screen and allow you to use google or babel fish or one of the other online text translators to on-the-fly translate spoken -- i 'm sorry -- typed text between individuals and so the multicultural nature and the sort of cultural melting pot that 's happening inside second life is quite -- i think quite remarkable relative to what in real human terms in the real world we 've ever been able to achieve so i think that culture will fine-tune it will emerge but we still have some years to wait while that happens as you would naturally expect jh : other questions right here jh : what 's your demographic pr : so the question is what 's the demographic so the average age of a person in second life is 32 however the use of second life increases dramatically as your physical age increases so as you go from age 30 to age 60 -- and there are many people in their sixties using second life -- this is also not a sharp curve -- it 's very very distributed -- usage goes up in terms of like hours per week by 40 percent as you go from age 30 to age 60 in real life so there 's not -- many people make the mistake of believing that second life is some kind of an online game actually it 's generally unappealing -- i 'm just speaking broadly and critically -- it 's not very appealing to people that play online video games because the graphics are not yet equivalent to -- i mean these are very nice pictures but in general the graphics are not quite equivalent to the fine-tuned graphics that you see in a grand theft auto 4 so average age : 32 i mentioned 65 percent of the users are not in the united states the distribution amongst countries is extremely broad there 's users from you know virtually every country in the world now in second life the dominant ones are -- if you take the uk and europe together they make up about 55 percent of the usage base in second life in terms of psychographic -- oh men and women : men and women are almost equally matched in second life so about 45 percent of the people online right now on second life are women women use second life though about 30 to 40 percent more on an hours basis than men do meaning that more men sign up than women and more women stay and use it than men so that 's another demographic fact in terms of psychographic you know the people in second life are remarkably dissimilar relative to what you might think when you go in and talk to them and meet them and i would you know challenge you to just do this and find out but it 's not a bunch of programmers it 's not easy to describe as a demographic if i had to just sort of paint a broad picture i 'd say remember the people who were really getting into ebay in the first few years of ebay maybe a little bit like that : in other words people who are early adopters they tend to be creative they tend to be entrepreneurial a lot of them -- about 55,000 people so far -- are cash-flow positive : they 're making money from what -- i mean real-world money -- from what they 're doing in second life so it 's a very build -- still a creative building things build-your-own-business type of an orientation so that 's it jh : you describe yourself philip as someone who was really creative when you were young and you know liked to make things i mean it 's not often that you hear somebody describe themselves as really creative i suspect that 's possibly a euphemism for c student who spent a lot of time in his room is it possible pr : i was a -- there were times i was a c student you know it 's funny when i got to college -- i studied physics in college -- and i got really -- it was funny because i was definitely a more antisocial kid i read all the time i was shy i do n't seem like it now but i was very shy moved around a bunch -- had that experience too so i did kind of i think live in my own world and obviously that helps you know engage your real interest in something jh : so you 're on your fifth life at this point pr : if you count yeah cities so -- but i did -- and i did n't do -- i think i did n't do as well in school as i could have i think you 're right i was n't like an obsessed -- you know get a 's kind of guy i was going to say i had a great social experience when i went to college that i had n't had before a more fraternal experience where i met six or seven other guys who i studied physics with and i was very competitive with them so then i started to get a 's but you 're right : i was n't an a student jh : last question right here jh : you want to paraphrase that pr : yeah so let me restate that so you 're saying that in the pamphlet there 's a statement that we may come to prefer our digital selves to our real ones -- our more malleable or manageable digital identities to our real identities -- and that in fact much of human life and human experience may move into the digital realm and then that 's kind of a horrifying thought of course that 's a frightening change frightening disruption i guess and you 're asking what do i think about that how do i -- jh : what 's your response to the people who would say that 's horrifying ( audience : if someone would say to you i find that disturbing what would be your response ) pr : well i 'd say a couple of things one is it 's disturbing like the internet or electricity was that is to say it 's a big change but it is n't avoidable so no amount of backpedaling or intentional behavior or political behavior is going to keep these technology changes from connecting us together because the basic motive that people have -- to be creative and entrepreneurial -- is going to drive energy into these virtual worlds in the same way that it has with the web so this change i believe is a huge disruptive change obviously i 'm the optimist and a big believer in what 's going on here but i think that as -- even a sober you know the most sober disconnected thinker about this looking at it from the side has to conclude based on the data that with those kinds of economic forces at play there is definitely going to be a sea change and that change is going to be intensely disruptive relative to our concept of our very lives and being and our identities as well i do n't think we can get away from those changes i think generally we were talking about this -- i think that generally being present in a virtual world and being challenged by it being -- surviving there having a good life there so to speak is a challenge because of the multiculturality of it because of the languages because of the entrepreneurial richness of it the sort of flea market nature if you will of the virtual world today it puts challenges on us to rise to we must be better than ourselves in many ways we must learn things and you know be more tolerant and be smarter and learn faster and be more creative perhaps than we are typically in our real lives and i think that if that is true of virtual worlds then these changes though scary -- and i say inevitable -- are ultimately for the better and therefore something that we should ride out but i would say that -- and many other authors and speakers about this other than me have said you know fasten your seat belts because the change is coming there are going to be big changes jh : philip rosedale thank you very much â™« you 're older than you 've ever been â™« â™« and now you 're even older â™« â™« and now you 're even

ago and i 'm happy to report that this performance you are seeing today is the earliest we have ever performed so thank you we are cultural test pilots ladies and gentlemen how early can a rock performance begin not all the facts are in about performing at 8.30 in the morning i can tell you the 19 degree thing was fantastic all right so we do n't know that much about the history of

audience have a great session thank you all i 'll just take you to bangladesh for a minute before i tell that story we should ask ourselves the question : why does poverty exist i mean there is plenty of knowledge and scientific breakthroughs we all live in the same planet but there 's still a great deal of poverty in the world and i think -- so i want to throw a perspective that i have so that we can assess this project or any other project for that matter to see whether it 's contributing or -- contributing to poverty or trying to alleviate it rich countries have been sending aid to poor countries for the last 60 years and by and large this has failed and you can see this book written by someone who worked in the world bank for 20 years and he finds economic growth in this country to be elusive by and large it did not work so the question is why is that in my mind there is something to learn from the history of europe i mean even here yesterday i was walking across the street and they showed three bishops were executed 500 years ago right across the street from here so my point is there 's a lot of struggle has gone in europe where citizens were empowered by technologies and they demanded authorities from -- to come down from their high horses and in the end there 's better bargaining between the authorities and citizens and democracies capitalism -- everything else flourished and so you can see the real process of -- and this is backed up by this 500-page book -- that the authorities came down and citizens got up but if you look if you have that perspective then you can see what happened in the last 60 years aid actually did the opposite it empowered authorities and as a result marginalized citizens the authorities did not have the reason to make economic growth happen so that they could tax people and make more money for to run their business because they were getting it from abroad and in fact if you see oil-rich countries where citizens are not yet empowered the same thing goes -- nigeria saudi arabia all sorts of countries because the aid and oil or mineral money acts the same way it empowers authorities without activating the citizens -- their hands legs brains what have you and if you agree with that then i think the best way to improve these countries is to recognize that economic development is of the people by the people for the people and that is the real network effect if citizens can network and make themselves more organized and productive so that their voices are heard so then things would improve and to contrast that you can see the most important institution in the world the world bank is an organization of the government by the government for the governments just see the contrast and that is the perspective i have and then i can start my story of course how would you empower citizens there could be all sorts of technologies and one is cell phones recently " the economist " recognized this but i stumbled upon the idea 12 years ago and that 's what i 've been working on so 12 years ago i was trying to be an investment banker in new york we had -- quite a few our colleagues were connected by a computer network and we got more productive because we did n't have to exchange floppy disks ; we could update each other more often but one time it broke down and it reminded me of a day in 1971 there was a war going on in my country and my family moved out of an urban place where we used to live to a remote rural area where it was safer and one time my mother asked me to get some medicine for a younger sibling and i walked 10 miles or so all morning to get there to the medicine man and he was n't there so i walked all afternoon back so i had another unproductive day so while i was sitting in a tall building in new york i put those two experiences together side by side and basically concluded that connectivity is productivity -- whether it 's in a modern office or an underdeveloped village so naturally i -- the implication of that is that the telephone is a weapon against poverty and if that 's the case then the question is how many telephones did we have at that time and it turns out that there was one telephone in bangladesh for every 500 people and all those phones were in the few urban places the vast rural areas where 100 million people lived there were no telephones so just imagine how many man-months or man-years are wasted just like i wasted a day if you just multiply by 100 million people let 's say losing one day a month whatever and you see a vast amount of resource wasted and after all poor countries like rich countries one thing we 've got equal is their days are the same length : 24 hours so if you lose that precious resource where you are somewhat equal to the richer countries that 's a huge waste so i started looking for any evidence that -- does connectivity really increase productivity and i could n't find much really but i found this graph produced by the itu which is the international telecommunication union based in geneva they show an interesting thing that you see the horizontal axis is where you place your country so the united states or the uk would be here outside and so the impact of one new telephone which is on the vertical axis is very little but if you come back to a poorer country where the gnp per capita is let 's say 500 dollars or 300 dollars then the impact is huge : 6,000 dollars or 5,000 dollars the question was how much did it cost to install a new telephone in bangladesh it turns out : 2,000 dollars so if you spend 2,000 dollars and let 's say the telephone lasts 10 years and if 5,000 dollars every year -- so that 's 50,000 dollars so obviously this was a gadget to have and of course if the cost of installing a telephone is going down because there 's a digital revolution going on then it would be even more dramatic and i knew a little economics by then -- it says adam smith taught us that specialization leads to productivity but how would you specialize let 's say i 'm a fisherman and a farmer and chris is a fisherman farmer both are generalists so the point is that we could only -- the only way we could depend on each other is if we can connect with each other and if we are neighbors i could just walk over to his house but then we are limiting our economic sphere to something very small area but in order to expand that you need a river or you need a highway or you need telephone lines but in any event it 's connectivity that leads to dependability and that leads to specialization that leads to productivity so the question was i started looking at this issue and going back and forth between bangladesh and new york there were a lot of reasons people told me why we do n't have enough telephones and one of them is the lacking buying power poor people apparently do n't have the power to buy but the point is if it 's a production tool why do we have to worry about that i mean in america people buy cars and they put very little money down they get a car and they go to work the work pays them a salary ; the salary allows them to pay for the car over time the car pays for itself so if the telephone is a production tool then we do n't quite have to worry about the purchasing power and of course even if that 's true then what about initial buying power so then the question is why ca n't we have some kind of shared access in the united states we have -- everybody needs a banking service but very few of us are trying to buy a bank so it 's -- a bank tends to serve a whole community so we could do that for telephones and also people told me that we have a lot of important primary needs to meet : food clothing shelter whatever but again it 's very paternalistic you should be raising income and let people decide what they want to do with their money but the real problem is the lack of other infrastructures see you need some kind of infrastructure to bring a new thing for instance the internet was booming in the u.s. because there were -- there were people who had computers they had modems they had telephone lines so it 's very easy to bring in a new idea like the internet but that 's what 's lacking in a poor country so for example we did n't have ways to have credit checks few banks to collect bills etc but that 's why i noticed grameen bank which is a bank for poor people and had 1,100 branches 12,000 employees 2.3 million borrowers and they had these branches i thought i could put cell towers and create a network and anyway to cut the time short -- so i started -- i first went to them and said " you know perhaps i could connect all your branches and make you more efficient " but you know they have after all evolved in a country without telephones so they are decentralized i mean of course there might be other good reasons but this was one of the reasons -- they had to be and so they were not that interested to connect all their branches and then to be -- and rock the boat so i started focusing what is it that they really do so what happens is that somebody borrows money from the bank she typically buys a cow the cow gives milk and she sells the milk to the villagers and pays off the loan and this is a business for her but it 's milk for everybody else and suddenly i realized that a cell phone could be a cow because some way she could borrow 200 dollars from the bank get a phone and have the phone for everybody and it 's a business for her so i wrote to the bank and they thought for a while and they said " it 's a little crazy but logical if you think it can be done come and make it happen " so i quit my job ; i went back to bangladesh i created a company in america called gonofone which in bengali means " people 's phone " and angel investors in america put in money into that i flew around the world after about a million -- i mean i got rejected from lots of places because i was not only trying to go to a poor country i was trying to go to the poor of the poor country after about a million miles and a meaningful -- a substantial loss of hair i eventually put together a consortium and -- which involved the norwegian telephone company which provided the know-how and the grameen bank provided the infrastructure to spread the service to make the story short here is the coverage of the country you can see it 's pretty much covered even in bangladesh there are some empty places but we are also investing around another 300 million dollars this year to extend that coverage now about that cow model i talked about there are about 115,000 people who are retailing telephone services in their neighborhoods and it 's serving 52,000 villages which represent about 80 million people and these phones are generating about 100 million dollars for the company and two dollars profit per entrepreneur per day which is like 700 dollars per year and of course it 's very beneficial in a lot of ways it increases income improves welfare etc and the result is right now this company is the largest telephone company with 3.5 million subscribers 115,000 of these phones i talked about -- that produces about a third of the traffic in the network and 2004 the net profit after taxes -- very serious taxes -- was 120 million dollars and the company contributed about 190 million dollars to the government coffers and again here are some of the lessons " the government needs to provide economically viable services " actually this is an instance where private companies can provide that " governments need to subsidize private companies " this is what some people think and actually private companies help governments with taxes " poor people are recipients " poor people are a resource " services cost too much for the poor " their involvement reduces the cost " the poor are uneducated and can not do much " they are very eager learners and very capable survivors i 've been very surprised most of them learn how to operate a telephone within a day " poor countries need aid " businesses -- this one company has raised the -- if the ideal figures are even five percent true this one company is raising the gnp of the country much more than the aid the country receives and as i was trying to show you as far as i 'm concerned aid does damages because it removes the government from its citizens and this is a new project i have with dean kamen the famous inventor in america he has produced some power generators which we are now doing an experiment in bangladesh in two villages where cow manure is producing biogas which is running these generators and each of these generators is selling electricity to 20 houses each it 's just an experiment we do n't know how far it will go but it 's going on thank you i 'm a or was or kind of am a toy designer and before i was a toy designer oh i was a mime a street mime actually and then i was an entertainer i guess and before that i was a silversmith and before that i was -- i was out of the house at about 15 and a half and i never wound up going into college i did n't really -- i did n't see the point at the time i do now after learning about all the quantum stuff it 's really cool anyway i wanted to show you a little bit about the world of toy design at least from my small aperture of the world this is a video i made when i first started doing toy design i 'm in my garage making weird stuff and then you go to these toy companies and there 's some guy across the table and he goes " pass pass pass " you know you think it 's so cool but they -- anyway i made this little tape that i 'd always show when i go in this is the name of my company giving toys so i used to work at mattel actually and after i left mattel i started all these hamburger makers and then got the license to make the maker so this is a hamburger maker that you take the peanut butter and stuff and you put it in there and it makes -- and this is a french fry maker little tiny food you can eat i beat up the pasta maker to make that then this is a mcnugget maker i think this now that 's the mcnugget maker and this is a -- this is my oldest daughter making a mcapple pie and let 's see you can make the pie and cinnamon and sugar and then you eat and you eat and you eat and you -- she 's about 300 pounds now no she 's not she 's beautiful this is how they looked when they came out at the end these are a -- this is like a 15 million dollar line and it got me through some -- i did n't make any royalties on this but it got me through next is a compilation of a bunch of stuff that was a missile foam launcher that did n't get sold this is a squishy head for no apparent reason this is some effects that i did for " wig rattle and roll " that was a robot eye thing controlling it in the back that paid the rent for about a month this is a walking barbie -- i said " oh this is it ! " and they go " oh that 's really nice " and out it goes so this is some fighting robots i thought everyone would want these they fight they get back up you know would n't this be cool and they made it into a toy and then they dropped it like a hot rock they 're pretty cool this is a -- we 're doing some flight-testing on my little pug seeing if this can really grab it does pretty good i 'm using little phone connectors to make them so they can spin it 's how they see have those album things -- kids do n't know what they are this is a clay maker you know i said -- i went to play-doh and said " look i can animate this " they said " do n't talk to us about play-doh " and then i made a lego animator i thought this would be so great ! and you know lego -- do n't take legos to lego that 's the answer they know everything about it then i started doing animatronics i loved dinosaurs i used to be in the film business kind of and actually nicholas negroponte saw this when i was like 12 and anyway so then they said " no you have to make two and they have to fight " you know how -- why would a kid want a dinosaur this is me using [ unclear ] or 3-d studio back in the '80s that 's david letterman you can see how old this stuff is that 's my youngest cousin this is a segment called " dangerous toys you wo n't see at christmas " we had my first saw blade launcher and we had a flamethrower chair my career basically peaked here and in the back are foam-core cutouts of the people who could n't make it to the show this is mek going through a windshield wiper motor so this is a -- i used to kind of be an actor and i 'm really not very good at it but the -- this is a guy named dr. yatz who would take toys apart and show kids about engineering and you can see the massively parallel processing nintendos there and over to the left is a view master of the cd-rom and a guy named stan reznikov did this as a pilot this is a -- you can see the little window there you can actually see the steadicam with a bubble on the bottom you see the keyboard strapped to my wrist way ahead of my time here narrator : i love toys ! caleb chung : that 's all i wanted to say there i love toys ok so so that was a that was the first kind of a -- that was the first batch of products most of them did not go you get one out of 20 one out of 30 products and every now and then we do something like a you know an automated hair wrap machine you know that tangles your hair and pulls your scalp out and -- and we 'd make some money on that you know and we 'd give it out but eventually we left l.a. and we moved to idaho where there was actually a lot of peace and quiet and i started working on this project -- oh i have to tell you about this real quick throughout this whole thing making toys i think there is a real correlation with innovation and art and science there 's some kind of a blend that happens that allows you know to find innovation and i tried to sum this up in some kind of symbol that means something to me anyway and so art and science have a kind of dynamic balance that 's where i think innovation happens and actually this is to me how i can come up with great ideas but it 's not how you actually get leverage actually you have to put a circle around that and call it business and those three together i think give you leverage in the world but moving on so this is a quick tale i 'm going to tell this is the furby tale as he said i was co-inventor of the furby i did the body and creature -- well you 'll see so by way of showing you this you can kind of get an understanding of what it is to hopefully try to create robotic life forms or technology that has an emotional connection with the user so this is my family this is my wife christi and abby and melissa and my 17-year-old now emily who was just a pack of trouble all right there 's that robot again i came out of the movie business as i said and i said let 's make these animatronic robots let 's make these things and so i 've always had a big interest in this this one actually did n't go anywhere but i got my feet wet doing this this is a smaller one and i have a little moving torso on there a little tiny guy walks along more servo drives lots of servo hacking lots of mechanical stuff there 's another one he actually has skeletor legs i think he 's wearing there oh this is a little pony little pony -- very cute little thing the point of showing these is i 've always been interested in little artificial life pieces so the challenge was -- i worked for microsoft for a little bit working on the microsoft barney and this is a -- you know the purple dinosaur with kind of bloat wear and you know they had lots just lots of stuff in there that you did n't need i thought and then microsoft can just fill a you know a warehouse full of this stuff and see if they sell so it 's a really strange business model compared to coming from a toy company but anyway a friend of mine and i dave hampton decided to see if we could do like a single-cell organism what 's the fewest pieces we could use to make a little life form and that 's our little thirty-cent mabuchi motor and so i have all these design books like i 'm sure many of you have and throughout the books -- this is the first page on furby -- i have kind of the art and science i have the why over here and the how over there i try to do a lot of philosophy a lot of thinking about all of these projects because they 're not just " bing " ideas ; you have to really dig deep in these things so there 's some real pseudo-code over here and getting the idea of different kind of drives things like that and originally furby only had two eyes and some batteries on the bottom and then we said well you 're going to feed him and he needs to talk and it got more complicated and then i had to figure out how i 'm going to use that one motor to make the eyes move and the ears move and the body to move and the mouth to move and you know i want to make it blink and do all that at the same time well i came up with this kind of linear expression thing with these cams and feedback and that worked pretty well then i started to get a little more realistic and i have to start drawing the stuff and there 's my " note to self " at the top : " lots of engineering " so that turned out to be a little more than true there 's my first exploded view and all the little pieces and the little worm drive and all that stuff and then i 've got to start building it so this is the real thing i get up and start cutting my finger and gluing things together and that 's my little workshop and there 's the first little cam that drove furby and there 's furby on the half shell you can see the little bb in the box is my tilt sensor i just basically gnawed all this stuff out of plastic so there 's the back of his head with a billion holes in it and there i am i 'm done there 's my little furby no it 's a little robot on heroin or something i think so right now you see i love little robots so my wife says " well you may like it but nobody else will " so she comes to the rescue this is my wife christi who is just you know my muse and my partner for eternity here and she does drawings right she 's an actual you know artist and she starts doing all these different drawings and does color patterns and coloring books and i like the guy with the cigar at the bottom there he did n't test so well but i like him and then she started doing these other images at that time beanie babies was a big hit and we thought we 'll do a bunch of different ones so here 's a little pink one a little pouf on his head and here 's -- this did n't do so well in testing either i do n't know why there 's my favorite demon furby that was a good one anyway finally settled on kind of this kind of a look little poufy body a little imaginary character and there he is a little bush baby on -- caught in the headlights there i actually went to toys " r " us got a little furry cat ripped it apart and made this and since then every time i come home from toys " r " us with dolls or something they disappear from my desk and they get hidden in the house i have three girls and they just they -- it 's like a rescue animal thing they 're going there so a little tether coming off it 's just a control for the fur 's mouth and his eyes it 's just a little server control and i made a little video going : " hi my name 's furby and i 'm good " you know and then i 'd reach my hand he 'd -- you can tickle him when i put my hand up " ha ha ha ha " and that 's how we sold him and hasbro actually said i meant tiger electronics at the time said " yeah we want to do this we have you know 13 weeks or something to toy fair and we 're going to hire you guys to do this " and so dave and i got working mostly me because it was all mechanics at this point so now i have to really figure out all kinds of stuff i do n't know how to do and i started working with solid works and a whole other group to do that and we started -- this was way back before there was really much sla going on not a lot of rapid prototyping we certainly did n't have the money to do this they only paid me like a little bit of money to do this so i had to call a friend of a friend who was running the gm prototype plant sla plant that was down and they said " yeah well we 'll run them " so they ran all the shells for us which was nice of them and the cams i got cut at hewlett packard we snuck in on the weekend and so we just had a disc of the files but they have a closed system so you could n't print the things out on the machine so we actually printed them out on clear and taped them on the monitors and on the weekend we ran the parts for that so this is how they come out close to the end and then they looked like little garfields there eight months later -- you may remember this this was a -- total total total chaos for a while they were making two million furbys a month they actually wound up doing about 40 million furbys i -- it 's unbelievable how -- i do n't know how that can be and hasbro made about you know a billion and a half dollars and i just a little bit on each one so full circle -- why do i do this why do you you know try to do this stuff and it 's of course for your kids and there 's my youngest daughter with her furbys and she still actually has those so i kind of retired and we 're already living in paradise up in boise on a river you know so and then i started another company called toy innovation and we did some projects with mattel with actually with a lady who 's here ivy ross and we did miracle moves baby made it in wired magazine did a bunch of other stuff and then i started another company we did a little hand-held device for teens that could hook up to the internet won " best innovations " at ces but really i kind of slowed down and said ok i just â€¦ after a while i had this old tape of this dinosaur and i gave it to this guy and this other guy saw it and then people started to want to do it and they said they 'd spend all this time so i said " ok let 's try to do this dinosaur project " the crazy idea is we 're going to try to clone a dinosaur as much as we can with today 's technology and it 's not really -- but as close as we can do and we 're going to try to really pull this off intentfully try to make something that seems like it 's alive not a robot that kind of does but let 's really go for it so i picked a camarasaurus because the camarasaurus was the most abundant of the sauropods in north america and you could actually find full fossil evidence of these that 's a juvenile and so we actually went in there 's a book called " walking on eggshells " where they found actual sauropod skin in patagonia and the picture from the book so when i -- i told the sculptor to use this bump pattern whatever you can to copy that very very obsessive there 's a kind of truncated camarasaurus skeleton but the geometry 's correct and then i went in and measured all the geometry because i figured hey biomimicry if i do it kind of right it might move kind of like the real thing so there 's the motor and about this time you know all these other people are starting to help here 's an example of what we did with the skull there 's the skull there 's my drawing of a skull there 's kind of the skin version of the soft tissue there 's the mechanism that would go in there kind of a geneva drive there 's some solid works versions of it here 's some sla parts of the same thing and then these are really crude pieces we were just doing some tests here there 's the skull pretty much the same shape as the camarasaurus there 's a photorealistic eye behind a lens and there 's kind of the first exploded view or see-through view there 's the first sla version and it already kind of has the feel it has kind of a cuteness already and the thing about blending science and art in this multidisciplinary stuff is you can do a robot and then you go back and do the shape and then you go back and forth the servos in the front legs we had to shape those like muscles they had to fit within the envelope there was a tremendous amount of work to get all that working right all the neck and the tail are cable so it moves smoothly and organically and then of course you 're not done yet you have to get the look for the skin the skin 's a whole another thing probably the hardest part so you hire artists and you try to get the look and feel of the character now this is not -- we 're character designers right and we 're still trying to keep with the real character so now you go back and you cover the whole thing with clay now you start doing the sculpture for this and you can see we got a guy from -- who 's just a fanatic about dinosaurs to do the sculpting for us down to the spoon-shaped teeth and everything and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then more sculpting and then four years and 10 million dollars later we have a little pleo john do you want to bring him up john sosoka is our cto and is really the man that 's done most of the work with our 40-person company i 'd like to give john a hand he never gets recognition this is john sosoka so thank you john thank you and get back to work all right man all right -- -- no it 's very painful so -- -- these are little pleos and you can probably see them this -- i on purpose -- they go through life stages so when you first get them they 're babies and you -- more you have them kind of the older they get and they kind of learn through their behavior so this one this one 's actually asleep and -- hang on pleo wake up pleo come on so this guy 's listening to my voice here but they have 40 sensors all over their body they have seven processors they have 14 motors they have -- but you do n't care do you they 're just cute right that 's the idea that 's the idea so you see -- hey come on hey did you feel that there 's something big and loud over here hey that 's good wake up wake up wake up yeah they 're like kids you know you yeah yeah okay he 's hungry i 'll show you what he 's been doing for for four years here here here have some money pleo there you go that 's what the investors think that it 's just -- -- right right so they 're really sweet little guys and we 're hoping that -- you know our belief is that humans need to feel empathy towards things in order to be more human and we think we can help that out by having little creatures that you can love now these are not robots they 're kind of lovebots you know they do change over time but mostly they evoke a feeling of caring and we have a -- i have a little something here now i do want to say that you know ugobe is not there yet we 've just opened the door and it 's for all of you to step through it we did include some things that are hopefully useful excuse me pleo they -- he has a usb and he has a sd card so it 's completely open architecture so anyone can plug him -- -- thank you this is john over here anyone can take pleo and they can totally redo his personality you can make him bipolar or as someone said a -- -- you can change his homeostatic drives or whatever you want to call them kids can just drag and drop put in new sounds we -- actually it 's very hard to keep people from doing this we have one animator who 's taken it and he 's done a take on the budweiser beer commercial and they 're going " whassup " you know you -- so it 's -- yes he likes that so they 're a handful we hope you get one i do n't know what i 'm missing to say but as a last thing i 'd like to say is that if we continue along this path we are designing our children 's best friends and there 's a lot of social responsibility in that that 's why pleo 's soft and gentle and loving and so i just -- i hope we all dream well thank you i spent the better part of a decade looking at american responses to mass atrocity and genocide and i 'd like to start by sharing with you one moment that to me sums up what there is to know about american and democratic responses to mass atrocity and that moment came on april 21 1994 so 14 years ago almost in the middle of the rwandan genocide in which 800,000 people would be systematically exterminated by the rwandan government and some extremist militia on april 21 in the new york times the paper reported that somewhere between 200,000 and 300,000 people had already been killed in the genocide it was in the paper -- not on the front page it was a lot like the holocaust coverage it was buried in the paper rwanda itself was not seen as newsworthy and amazingly genocide itself was not seen as newsworthy but on april 21 a wonderfully honest moment occurred and that was that an american congresswoman named patricia schroeder from colorado met with a group of journalists and one of the journalists said to her what 's up what 's going on in the u.s. government two to 300,000 people have just been exterminated in the last couple of weeks in rwanda it 's two weeks into the genocide at that time but of course at that time you do n't know how long it 's going to last and the journalist said why is there so little response out of washington why no hearings no denunciations no people getting arrested in front of the rwandan embassy or in front of the white house what 's the deal and she said -- she was so honest -- she said " it 's a great question all i can tell you is that in my congressional office in colorado and my office in washington we 're getting hundreds and hundreds of calls about the endangered ape and gorilla population in rwanda but nobody is calling about the people the phones just are n't ringing about the people " and the reason i give you this moment is there 's a deep truth in it and that truth is or was in the 20th century that while we were beginning to develop endangered species movements we did n't have an endangered people 's movement we had holocaust education in the schools most of us were groomed not only on images of nuclear catastrophe but also on images and knowledge of the holocaust there 's a museum of course on the mall in washington right next to lincoln and jefferson i mean we have owned never again culturally appropriately interestingly and yet the politicization of never again the operationalization of never again had never occurred in the 20th century and that 's what that moment with patricia schroeder i think shows : that if we are to bring about an end to the world 's worst atrocities we have to make it such there has to be a role -- there has to be the creation of political noise and political costs in response to massive crimes against humanity and so forth so that was the 20th century now here -- and this will be a relief to you at this point in the afternoon -- there is good news amazing news in the 21st century and that is that almost out of nowhere there has come into being an anti-genocide movement an anti-genocide constituency and one that looks destined in fact to be permanent it grew up in response to the atrocities in darfur it is comprised of students there are something like 300 anti-genocide chapters on college campuses around the country it 's bigger than the anti-apartheid movement there are something like 500 high school chapters devoted to stopping the genocide in darfur evangelicals have joined it jewish groups have joined it " hotel rwanda " watchers have joined it it is a cacophonous movement to call it a movement as with all movements perhaps is a little misleading it 's diverse it 's got a lot of different approaches it 's got all the ups and the downs of movements but it has been amazingly successful in one regard in that it has become it has congealed into this endangered people 's movement that was missing in the 20th century it sees itself such as it is the it as something that will create the impression that there will be political cost there will be a political price to be paid for allowing genocide for not having an heroic imagination for not being an upstander but for being in fact a bystander now because it 's student-driven there 's some amazing things that the movement has done they have launched a divestment campaign that has now convinced i think 55 universities in 22 states to divest their holdings of stocks with regard to companies doing business in sudan they have a 1-800-genocide number -- this is going to sound very kitsch but for those of you who may not be i mean may be apolitical but interested in doing something about genocide you dial 1-800-genocide and you type in your zip code and you do n't even have to know who your congressperson is it will refer you directly to your congressperson to your u.s. senator to your governor where divestment legislation is pending they 've lowered the transaction costs of stopping genocide i think the most innovative thing they 've introduced recently are genocide grades and it takes students to introduce genocide grades so what you now have when a congress is in session is members of congress calling up these 19-year-olds or 24-year-olds and saying i 'm just told i have a d minus on genocide ; what do i do to get a c i just want to get a c. help me and the students and the others who are part of this incredibly energized base are there to answer that and there 's always something to do now what this movement has done is it has extracted from the bush administration from the united states at a time of massive over-stretch -- military financial diplomatic -- a whole series of commitments to darfur that no other country in the world is making for instance the referral of the crimes in darfur to the international criminal court which the bush administration does n't like the expenditure of 3 billion dollars in refugee camps to try to keep basically the people who 've been displaced from their homes by the sudanese government by the so-called janjaweed the militia to keep those people alive until something more durable can be achieved and recently or now not that recently about six months ago the authorization of a peacekeeping force of 26,000 that will go and that 's all the bush administration 's leadership and it 's all because of this bottom-up pressure and the fact that the phones have n't stopped ringing from the beginning of this crisis the bad news however to this question of will evil prevail is that evil lives on the people in those camps are surrounded on all sides by so-called janjaweed these men on horseback with spears and kalashnikovs women who go to get firewood in order to heat the humanitarian aid in order to feed their families -- humanitarian aid the dirty secret of it is it has to be heated really to be edible -- are themselves subjected to rape which is a tool of the genocide that is being used and the peacekeepers i 've mentioned the force has been authorized but almost no country on earth has stepped forward since the authorization to actually put its troops or its police in harm 's way so we have achieved an awful lot relative to the 20th century and yet far too little relative to the gravity of the crime that is unfolding as we sit here as we speak why the limits to the movement why is what has been achieved or what the movement has done been necessary but not sufficient to the crime i think there are a couple -- there are many reasons -- but a couple just to focus on briefly the first is that the movement such as it is stops at america 's borders it is not a global movement it does not have too many compatriots abroad who themselves are asking their governments to do more to stop genocide and the holocaust culture that we have in this country makes americans sort of more prone to i think want to bring never again to life the guilt that the clinton administration expressed that bill clinton expressed over rwanda created a space in our society for a consensus that rwanda was bad and wrong and we wish we had done more and that is something that the movement has taken advantage of european governments for the most part have n't acknowledged responsibility and there 's nothing to kind of to push back and up against so this movement if it 's to be durable and global will have to cross borders and you will have to see other citizens in democracies not simply resting on the assumption that their government would do something in the face of genocide but actually making it such governments will never gravitate towards crimes of this magnitude naturally or eagerly as we saw they have n't even gravitated towards protecting our ports or reigning in loose nukes why would we expect in a bureaucracy that it would orient itself towards distant suffering so one reason is it has n't gone global the second is of course that at this time in particular in america 's history we have a credibility problem a legitimacy problem in international institutions it is structurally really really hard to do as the bush administration rightly does which is to denounce genocide on a monday and then describe water boarding on a tuesday as a no-brainer and then turn up on wednesday and look for troop commitments now other countries have their own reasons for not wanting to get involved let me be clear they 're in some ways using the bush administration as an alibi but it is essential for us to be a leader in this sphere of course to restore our standing and our leadership in the world the recovery 's going to take some time we have to ask ourselves what now what do we do going forward as a country and as citizens in relationship to the world 's worst places the world 's worst suffering killers and the kinds of killers that could come home to roost sometime in the future the place that i turned to answer that question was to a man that many of you may not have ever heard of and that is a brazilian named sergio vieira de mello who as chris said was blown up in iraq in 2003 he was the victim of the first-ever suicide bomb in iraq it 's hard to remember but there was actually a time in the summer of 2003 even after the u.s. invasion where apart from looting civilians were relatively safe in iraq now who was sergio sergio vieira de mello was his name in addition to being brazilian he was described to me before i met him in 1994 as someone who was a cross between james bond on the one hand and bobby kennedy on the other and in the u.n. you do n't get that many people who actually manage to merge those qualities he was james bond-like in that he was ingenious he was drawn to the flames he chased the flames he was like a moth to the flames something of an adrenalin junkie he was successful with women he was bobby kennedy-like because in some ways one could never tell if he was a realist masquerading as an idealist or an idealist masquerading as a realist as people always wondered about bobby kennedy and john kennedy in that way what he was was a decathlete of nation-building of problem-solving of troubleshooting in the world 's worst places and in the world 's most broken places in failing states genocidal states under-governed states precisely the kinds of places that threats to this country exist on the horizon and precisely the kinds of places where most of the world 's suffering tends to get concentrated these are the places he was drawn to he moved with the headlines he was in the u.n. for 34 years he joined at the age of 21 started off when the causes in the wars du jour in the '70s were wars of independence and decolonization he was there in bangladesh dealing with the outflow of millions of refugees -- the largest refugee flow in history up to that point he was in sudan when the civil war broke out there he was in cyprus right after the turkish invasion he was in mozambique for the war of independence he was in lebanon amazingly he was in lebanon -- the u.n. base was used -- palestinians staged attacks out from behind the u.n. base israel then invaded and overran the u.n. base sergio was in beirut when the u.s. embassy was hit by the first-ever suicide attack against the united states people date the beginning of this new era to 9/11 but surely 1983 with the attack on the us embassy and the marine barracks -- which sergio witnessed -- those are in fact in some ways the dawning of the era that we find ourselves in today from lebanon he went to bosnia in the '90s the issues were of course ethnic sectarian violence he was the first person to negotiate with the khmer rouge talk about evil prevailing i mean here he was in the room with the embodiment of evil in cambodia he negotiates with the serbs he actually crosses so far into this realm of talking to evil and trying to convince evil that it does n't need to prevail that he earns the nickname -- not sergio but serbio while he 's living in the balkans and conducting these kinds of negotiations he then goes to rwanda and to congo in the aftermath of the genocide and he 's the guy who has to decide -- huh ok the genocide is over ; 800,000 people have been killed ; the people responsible are fleeing into neighboring countries -- into congo into tanzania i 'm sergio i 'm a humanitarian and i want to feed those -- well i do n't want to feed the killers but i want to feed the two million people who are with them so we 're going to go we 're going to set up camps and we 're going to supply humanitarian aid but uh-oh the killers are within the camps well i 'd like to separate the sheep from the wolves let me go door-to-door to the international community and see if anybody will give me police or troops to do the separation and their response of course was no more than we wanted to stop the genocide and put our troops in harm 's way to do that nor do we now want to get in the way and pluck genocidaires from camps so then you have to make the decision do you turn off the international spigot of life support and risk two million civilian lives or do you continue feeding the civilians knowing that the genocidaires are in the camps literally sharpening their knives for future battle what do you do it 's all lesser-evil terrain in these broken places late '90s : nation-building is the cause du jour he 's the guy put in charge he 's the paul bremer or the jerry bremer of first kosovo and then east timor he governs the places he 's the viceroy he has to decide on tax policy on currency on border patrol on policing he has to make all these judgments he 's a brazilian in these places he speaks seven languages he 's been up to that point in 14 war zones so he 's positioned to make better judgments perhaps than people who have never done that kind of work but nonetheless he is the cutting edge of our experimentation with doing good with very few resources being brought to bear in again the world 's worst places and then after timor 9/11 has happened he 's named u.n. human rights commissioner and he has to balance liberty and security and figure out what do you do when the most powerful country in the united nations is bowing out of the geneva conventions bowing out of international law do you denounce well if you denounce you 're probably never going to get back in the room maybe you stay reticent maybe you try to charm president bush -- and that 's what he did and in so doing he earned himself unfortunately his final and tragic appointment to iraq -- the one that resulted in his death one note on his death which is so devastating is that despite predicating the war on iraq on a link between saddam hussein and terrorism in 9/11 believe it or not the bush administration or the invaders did no planning no pre-war planning to respond to terrorism so sergio -- this receptacle of all of this learning on how to deal with evil and how to deal with brokenness lay under the rubble for three and a half hours without rescue stateless the guy who tried to help the stateless people his whole career like a refugee because he represents the u.n if you represent everyone in some ways you represent no one you 're un-owned and what the american -- the most powerful military in the history of mankind was able to muster for his rescue believe it or not was literally these heroic two american soldiers went into the shaft building was shaking one of them had been at 9/11 and lost his buddies on september 11th and yet went in and risked his life in order to save sergio but all they had was a woman 's handbag -- literally one of those basket handbags -- and they tied it to a curtain rope from one of the offices at u.n. headquarters and created a pulley system into this shaft in this quivering building in the interests of rescuing this person the person we most need to turn to now this shepherd at a time when so many of us feel like we 're lacking guidance and this was the pulley system this was what we were able to muster for sergio the good news for what it 's worth is after sergio and 21 others were killed that day in the attack on the u.n. the military created a search and rescue unit that had the cutting equipment the shoring wood the cranes the things that you would have needed to do the rescue but it was too late for sergio i want to wrap up but i want to close with what i take to be the four lessons from sergio 's life on this question of how do we prevent evil from prevailing which is how i would have framed the question here 's this guy who got a 34-year head start thinking about the kinds of questions we as a country are grappling with we as citizens are grappling with now what do we take away first i think is his relationship to in fact evil is something to learn from he over the course of his career changed a great deal he had a lot of flaws but he was very adaptive i think that was his greatest quality he started as somebody who would denounce harmdoers he would charge up to people who were violating international law and he would say you 're violating this is the u.n. charter do n't you see it 's unacceptable what you 're doing and they would laugh at him because he did n't have the power of states the power of any military or police he just had the rules he had the norms and he tried to use them and in lebanon southern lebanon in '82 he said to himself and to everybody else i will never use the word " unacceptable " again i will never use it i will try to make it such but i will never use that word again but he lunged in the opposite direction he started as i mentioned to get in the room with evil to not denounce and became almost obsequious when he won the nickname serbio for instance and even when he negotiated with the khmer rouge would black-box what had occurred prior to entering the room but by the end of his life i think he had struck a balance that we as a country can learn from be in the room do n't be afraid of talking to your adversaries but do n't bracket what happened before you entered the room do n't black-box history do n't check your principles at the door and i think that 's something that we have to be in the room whether it 's nixon going to china or khrushchev and kennedy or reagan and gorbachev all the great progress in this country with relation to our adversaries has come by going into the room and it does n't have to be an act of weakness you can actually do far more to build an international coalition against a harmdoer or a wrongdoer by being in the room and showing to the rest of the world that that person that regime is the problem and that you the united states are not the problem second take-away from sergio 's life briefly what i take away and this in some ways is the most important he espoused and exhibited a reverence for dignity that was really really unusual at a micro level the individuals around him were visible he saw them at a macro level he thought you know we talk about democracy promotion but we do it in a way sometimes that 's an affront to people 's dignity we put people on humanitarian aid and we boast about it because we 've spent three billion it 's incredibly important those people would no longer be alive if the united states for instance had n't spent that money in darfur but it 's not a way to live if we think about dignity in our conduct as citizens and as individuals with relation to the people around us and as a country if we could inject a regard for dignity into our dealings with other countries it would be something of a revolution third point very briefly he talked a lot about freedom from fear and i recognize there is so much to be afraid of there are so many genuine threats in the world but what sergio was talking about is let 's calibrate our relationship to the threat let 's not hype the threat ; let 's actually see it clearly we have reason to be afraid of melting ice caps we have reason to be afraid that we have n't secured loose nuclear material in the former soviet union let 's focus on what are the legitimate challenges and threats but not lunge into bad decisions because of a panic of a fear in times of fear for instance one of the things sergio used to say is fear is a bad advisor we lunge towards the extremes when we are n't operating and trying to again calibrate our relationship to the world around us fourth and final point : he somehow because he was working in all the world 's worst places and all lesser evils had a humility of course and an awareness of the complexity of the world around him i mean such an acute awareness of how hard it was how sisyphean this task was of mending and yet aware of that complexity humbled by it he was n't paralyzed by it and we as citizens as we go through this experience of the kind of the crisis of confidence crisis of competence crisis of legitimacy i think there 's a temptation to pull back from the world and say ah katrina iraq -- we do n't know what we 're doing we ca n't afford to pull back from the world it 's a question of how to be in the world and the lesson i think of the anti-genocide movement that i mentioned that is a partial success but by no means has it achieved what it has set out to do -- it 'll be many decades probably before that happens -- but is that if we want to see change we have to become the change we ca n't rely upon our institutions to do the work of necessarily talking to adversaries on their own without us creating a space for that to happen for having respect for dignity and for bringing that combination of humility and a sort of emboldened sense of responsibility to our dealings with the rest of the world so will evil prevail is that the question i think the short answer is : no not unless we let it thank you chris anderson : william hi good to see you william kamkwamba : thanks ca : so we 've got a picture i think where is this wk : this is my home this is where i live ca : where what country wk : in malawi kasungu in kasungu yeah mala ca : ok. now you 're 19 now wk : yeah i 'm 19 years now ca : five years ago you had an idea what was that wk : i wanted to make a windmill ca : a windmill wk : yeah ca : what to power -- for lighting and stuff wk : yeah ca : so what did you do how did you realize that wk : after i dropped out of school i went to library and i read a book that would -- " using energy " and i get information about doing the mill and i tried and i made it ca : so you copied -- you exactly copied the design in the book wk : ah no i just -- ca : what happened wk : in fact a design of the windmill that was in the book it has got four -- ah -- three blades and mine has got four blades ca : the book had three yours had four wk : yeah ca : and you made it out of what wk : i made four blades just because i want to increase power ca : ok wk : yeah ca : you tested three and found that four worked better wk : yeah i test ca : and what did you make the windmill out of what materials did you use wk : i use a bicycle frame and a pulley and plastic pipe what then pulls -- ca : do we have a picture of that can we have the next slide wk : yeah the windmill ca : and so and that windmill what -- it worked wk : when the wind blows it rotates and generates ca : how much electricity wk : 12 watts ca : and so that lit a light for the house how many lights wk : four bulbs and two radios ca : wow wk : yeah ca : next slide -- so who 's that wk : this is my parents holding the radio ca : so what did they make of -- that you were 14 15 at the time -- what did they make of this they were impressed wk : yeah ca : and so what 's your -- what are you going to do with this wk : um -- ca : what do you -- i mean -- do you want to build another one wk : yeah i want to build another one -- to pump water and irrigation for crops ca : so this one would have to be bigger wk : yeah ca : how big wk : i think it will produce more than 20 the watts ca : so that would produce irrigation for the entire village wk : yeah ca : wow and so you 're talking to people here at ted to get people who might be able to help in some way to realize this dream wk : yeah if they can help me with materials yeah ca : and as you think of your life going forward you 're 19 now do you picture continuing with this dream of working in energy wk : yeah i 'm still thinking to work on energy ca : wow william it 's a real honor to have you at the ted conference thank you so much for coming wk : thank you i 've always wanted to be a cyborg one of my favorite shows as a kid was " the six million dollar man " and this is a little bit closer to the 240 dollar man or so but -- at at any rate i would normally feel very self-conscious and geeky wearing this around but a few days ago i saw one world-renowned statistician swallowing swords on stage here so i figure it 's ok amongst this group but that 's not what i want to talk about today i want to talk about toys and the power that i see inherent in them when i was a kid i attended montessori school up to sixth grade in atlanta georgia and at the time i did n't think much about it but then later i realized that that was the high point of my education from that point on everything else was pretty much downhill and it was n't until later as i started making games that -- i really actually think of them more as toys people call me a game designer but i really think of these things more as toys but i started getting very interested in maria montessori and her methods and the way she went about things and the way she thought it very valuable for kids to kind of discover things on their own rather than being taught these things overtly and she would design these toys where kids in playing with the toys would actually come to understand these deep principles of life and nature through play and since they discovered those things it really stuck with them so much more and also they would experience their own failures ; there was a failure-based aspect to learning there it was very important and so the games that i do i think of really more as modern montessori toys and i really kind of want them to be presented in a way to where kids can kind of explore and discover their own principles so a few years ago i actually started getting very interested in the seti program and that 's the way i work i get interested in different kinds of subjects i dive in i research them and then i try to figure out how to craft a toy around that so that other people can kind of experience the same sense of discovery as i did as i was learning that subject and it kind of led me to astrobiology which is the study of possible life in the universe and then drake 's equation which is looking at the probability of life arising on planets how long it might last how many planets are out there stuff like that and i started looking at how interesting drake 's equation was because it spanned all these different subjects -- physics chemistry sociology economics astronomy and another thing that really impressed me a long time ago was " powers of ten " charles and ray eames ' film and i started putting those two together and wondering could i build a toy where kids would kind of trip across all these interesting principles of life as it exists and as it might go in the future things where you might trip across things like the copernican principle the fermi paradox the anthropic principle the origin of life and so i 'm going to show you a toy today that i 've been working on that i think of more than anything else as kind of a philosophy toy in playing this toy you kind of -- this will bring up philosophical questions in you this game 's called " spore " i 've been working on it for several years it 's getting pretty close to finished now it occurs at all these different scales first of all from very very small to very very large i 'm just going to pop in at the start of the game and you actually start this game in a drop of water as a very very small single-cell creature and right off the bat you basically just have to live survive reproduce so here we are at a very microscopic scale swimming around and i actually realize that cells do n't have eyes but it helps to make it cute the players are going to play through every generation of this species and as you play the game the creature is actually growing bit by bit and as we start growing the camera will actually start zooming out and things that you see in the background there will actually start slowly pulling into the foreground showing you a little bit of what you 'll be interacting with as you grow so as we eat the camera starts pulling out and then we start interacting with kind of larger and larger organisms now we actually play through many generations here at the cellular scale i 'm going to skip ahead here at some point we get larger and we actually get to a macro-evolution scale now at this point we 're leaving the water and one thing that 's kind of important about this game is that at every level the player is designing their creature and that 's a fundamental aspect of this now in the evolution game here the creature scale basically you have to eat survive and then reproduce you know very darwinian one thing we noticed with " the sims " which is a game i did earlier is that players love making stuff when they were able to make stuff in the game they had a tremendous amount of empathy in connection to it even if it was n't as pretty as what other people would make it -- as a professional artist would make for games -- it really stuck with them and they really cared about what would happen to it so at this point we 've left the water and now with this little creature -- we could bring up the volume a little bit -- and now we might try to eat we might sneak up on this little guy over here maybe and try and eat him ok well we fight ok we got him now we get a meal so really at this part of the game what we 're doing is we 're running around and surviving and also getting to the next generation because we 're going to play through every generation of this creature we can mate so i 'm going to see if one of these creatures wants to mate with me yeah we did n't want to replay actual evolution with humans and all that because it 's almost more interesting to look at alternate possibilities in evolution evolution is usually presented as this one path that we took through but really it represents this huge set of possibilities now once we mate we click on the egg and this is where the game starts getting interesting because one of the things we really focused on here was giving the players very high-leverage tools so that for a very small amount of effort the player can make something very cool and it involves a lot of intelligence on the tool side but basically this is the editor where we 're going to design the next generation of our creature so it has a little spine i can move around here i can extend i can also inflate or deflate it with the mouse wheel so you sculpt it like clay we have parts here that i can put on or pull off the idea is that the player can basically design anything they can think of in this editor and we 'll basically bring it to life so for instance i might put some limbs on the character here i 'll inflate them kind of large and in this case i might decide i 'm going to put -- i 'll put mouths on the limbs so pretty much players are encouraged to be very creative in the game here i 'll give it one eye in the middle maybe scale it up a bit point it down and i 'll also give it a few legs so in some sense we want this to feel like an amplifier for the player 's imagination so that with a very small number of clicks a player can create something that they did n't really think was possible before you know this is almost like designing something like maya that an eight-year-old can use but really the goal here was within about a minute i wanted somebody to replicate what typically takes a pictorial artist several weeks to create ok now i 'll put some hands on it ok so here i 've basically thrown together a little creature let me give it a little weapon on the tail here so it can fight ok so that 's the complete model now we can actually go to the painting phase now at this phase the program actually has some understanding of the topology of this creature it kind of knows where the backbone is where the spine the limbs are it kind of knows how stripes should run how it should be shaded and so we 're procedurally generating the texture map and this is something a texture artist would take many many days to work on and then we can test it out once we 've done that and see how it would move around and so at this point the computer is procedurally animating this creature it 's looking at whatever i 've designed it will actually bring it to life and i can see how it might dance how it might show emotions how it might fight so it 's acting with its two mouths there i can even have it pose for a photo snap a little photo of it so at any rate then i bring this back into the game it 's born and i play the next generation of my creature through evolution now again the empathy that the players have when they create the content is tremendous now when players create content in this game it 's automatically sent up to a server and then redistributed to all the other players transparently so in fact as i 'm interacting in this world with other creatures these creatures are transparently coming from other players as they play so the process of playing the game is a process of building up this huge database of content and pretty much everything you 're going to see in this game there 's an editor for in the game that the player can create all the way up through civilization this is my baby when i eat i 'll actually start growing this is the next generation but i 'm going to skip way ahead here now normally what would happen is these creatures would work their way up eventually become intelligent i 'd start dealing with tribes cities and civilizations of them over time i 'm going to skip way ahead here to the space phase eventually they would go out into space and start colonizing and exploring the universe now really in some sense i want the players to be building this world in their imagination and then extracting it from them with the least amount of pain so that 's kind of what these tools are about are : how do we make the game play the player 's imagination-amplifier and how do we make these tools these editors something that are just as fun as the game itself so this is the planet that we 've been playing on up to this point in the game so far the entire game has been played on the surface of this little world here now at this point we 're actually dealing with a very little toy planet almost again like the montessori toy idea you know what happens if you give somebody a toy planet and let them play with a lot of dynamics on it what could they discover what might they learn on this this world was actually extracted from the player 's imagination so this is the planet that the player evolved on things like the buildings and the vehicles the architecture civilizations were all designed by the player up to this point so here 's a little city with some of our guys kind of walking around in it and most games kind of put the player in the role of luke skywalker this protagonist playing through this story really this is more about putting the player in the role of george lucas you know i want them after they 've played this game to have extracted an entire world that they 're now interacting with now as we pull down here we still have a whole set of creatures living on the surface of the planet there are all these different dynamics going on here in fact i can look over here and this is kind of a little simplified food web that 's going on with the creatures i can open this up and then scan what exists on the surface and get some sense of the diversity of creatures that were brought in some of these were created by the player others by other players and automatically sent over here but there 's a very simple little kind of calculation of what 's required how much plants are required for the herbivores to live how many herbivores for the carnivores to eat etc. that you actually have to balance actively now also with this phase we 're getting more and more god-like powers for the player and you can kind of experiment with this planet again as a toy so i can come in and i can do things and just treat this planet as a lump of clay we have very simple little weather systems you see here very simple geology for instance i could open one of my tools here and then carve out rivers so this whole thing is kind of like a big lump of clay a sculpture i can also play with the dynamics of this world over time so one of the things i can do is start pumping more co2 gases into the atmosphere and so that 's what i 'm doing here there 's actually a little read out down there of our planetary atmosphere pressure and temperature so as i start pumping in more atmosphere we 're going to start pushing up the greenhouse gases here and if you 'll start noticing we start seeing the ocean levels rise over time and our cities are going to be at risk too because a lot of these are coastal cities you can see the ocean levels are rising now and as they encroach upon the cities i 'll start losing cities here so basically i want the players to be able to experiment and explore a huge amount of failure space so there goes one city now over time this is actually going to heat up the planet so at first what we 're going to see is a global ocean rise here on this little toy planet but then over time -- i can speed it up just a little bit -- we 'll actually see the heat impact of that as well so not only will it get hotter but at some point it 's going to get so hot the oceans will entirely evaporate so at first they 'll go up and then they 'll evaporate and that 'll be my planet so basically what we 're getting here is the sequel to " an inconvenient truth " in about two minutes and that actually brings up an interesting point about games now here our entire oceans are evaporating off the surface and as it keeps getting hotter at some point the entire planet 's going to melt down here it goes so we 're not only simulating biological dynamics -- food webs and all that -- but also geologic you know on a very simple core scale and what 's interesting to me about games in some sense is that i think we can take a lot of long-term dynamics and compress them into very short-term kind of experiences because it 's so hard for people to think 50 or 100 years out but when you can give them a toy and they can experience these long-term dynamics in just a few minutes i think it 's an entirely different kind of point of view where we 're actually mapping using the game to re-map our intuition it 's almost in the same way that a telescope or microscope recalibrates your eyesight ; i think computer simulations can recalibrate your instinct across vast scales of both space and time so here 's our little solar system as we pull away from our melted planet here we actually have a couple of other planets in this solar system let 's fly to another one so in fact we 're going to have this unlimited number of worlds you can kind of explore here now as we move into the future and we start going out in this space and doing stuff we 're drawing a lot from things like science fiction and all my favorite science fiction movies i want to basically play out here as different dynamics so this planet actually has some life on it here it is some indigenous life down here now one of the tools i can eventually earn for my ufo is a monolith that i can drop down now as you can see these guys are actually starting to go up and bow to it and over time once they touch it they will become intelligent so i can actually pick a species on a planet and then make them sentient you see now they 've actually gone to tribal dynamics and now because i 'm actually the one here i can if i want to get out of the ufo and walk up and they should be worshipping me at this point as a god at first they 're a little freaked out ok well maybe they 're not worshipping me i think i 'll leave before they get hostile but we basically want a diversity of activities the players can play through this basically i want to be able to play " the day the earth stood still " " 2001 : a space odyssey " " star trek " " war of the worlds " now as we pull away from this world -- we 're going to keep pulling away from the star now one of the things that always frustrated me a little bit about astronomy when i was a kid is how it was always presented so two-dimensionally and so static as we pull away from the star here we 're actually going now out into interstellar space and we 're getting a sense of the space around our home star now what i really wanted to do is to present this basically as wonderfully 3d as it is actually is and not only that but also show the dynamics and a lot of the interesting objects that you might find maybe like in the hubble at pretty much realistic frequencies and scales so most people have no idea of the difference between like an emission nebula and a planetary nebula but these are the things that we can kind of put in this little galaxy here so we 're flying over here to what looks like a black hole i want to basically have the entire zoo of hubble objects that people can kind of interact with and play with again as toys so here 's a little black hole that we probably do n't want to get too close to but we also have stars and things as well if we pull all the way back we start seeing the entire galaxy here kind of slowly in motion and this is another thing where typically when people present galaxies it 's always been these very beautiful photos but they 're always static and when you actually bring it forward in time and start animating it it 's actually kind of amazing what a galaxy would look like fast forwarded this would be about one million years a second because you have about roughly one supernova every century or so and so you 'd have this wonderful sparkling thing with the disk slowly rotating and this is roughly what it would look like and so really part of this is about bringing the beauty of this of the natural world to somebody in a very imaginative way so that they can start calibrating their instinct across these vast scales of space and time chris was wondering what kind of gods that the players would become because if you think about it you 're going to have 15-year-olds 20-year-olds whatever flying around this universe and they might be a nurturing god they might be boot-strapping life on planets trying to terra-form and spread civilization you might be a vengeful god and going out and conquesting because you actually can do that you can go in and attack other intelligent races you might be a networking god building alliances which you can also do in the game or just curious going around and wanting to explore as much as you possibly can but basically the reason why i make toys like this is because i think if there 's one difference i could possibly make in the world that i would choose to make it 's that i would like to somehow give people just a little bit better calibration on long-term thinking because i think most of the problems that our world is facing right now is the result of short-term thinking and the fact that it is so hard for us to think 50 100 or 1,000 years out and i think by giving kids toys like this and letting them replay dynamics very long-term dynamics over the short term and getting some sense of what we 're doing now what it 's going to be like in 100 years i think probably is the most effective thing i can be doing to help the world and so that 's why i think personally that toys can change the world thank you i 'm going to discuss with you three of my inventions that can have an effect on 10 to a 100 million people which we will hope to see happen we discussed in the prior film some of the old things that we did like stents and insulin pumps for the diabetic and i 'd like to talk very briefly about three new inventions that will change the lives of many people at the present time it takes an average of three hours after the first symptoms of a heart attack are recognized by the patient before that patient arrives at an emergency room and people with silent ischemia -- which translated into english means they do n't have any symptoms -- it takes even longer for them to get to the hospital the ami acute myocardial infarction which is a doctor 's big word so they can charge you more money -- -- means a heart attack annual incidence : 1.2 million americans mortality : 300,000 people dying each year about half of them 600,000 have permanent damage to their heart that will cause them to have very bad problems later on thus 900,000 people either have died or have significant damage to their heart muscle symptoms are often denied by the patient particularly us men because we are very brave we are very brave and we do n't want to admit that i 'm having a hell of a chest pain then approximately 25 percent of all patients never have any symptoms what are we going to do about them how can we save their lives it 's particularly true of diabetics and elderly women well what is needed for the earliest possible warning of a heart attack a means to determine if there 's a complete blockage of a coronary artery that ladies and gentlemen is a heart attack the means consist of noting something a little technical st segment elevation of the electrogram -- translated into english that means that if there 's an electrical signal in the heart and one part of the ecg -- which we call the st segment -- elevates that is a sure sign of a heart attack and if we had a computer put into the body of a person who 's at risk we could know before they even have symptoms that they 're having a heart attack to save their life well the doctor can program a level of this st elevation voltage that will trigger an emergency alarm vibration like your cell phone but right by your clavicle bone and when it goes beep beep beep you better do something about it because if you want to live you have to get to some medical treatment so we have to try these devices out because the fda wo n't just let us use them on people unless we try it out first and the best model for this happens to be pigs and what we tried with the pig was external electrodes on the skin like you see in an emergency room and i 'm going to show you why they do n't work very well and then we put a lead which is a wire in the right ventricle inside the heart which does the electrogram which is the signal voltage from inside the heart well with the pig at the baseline before we blocked the pig 's artery to simulate a heart attack that was the signal after 43 seconds even an expert could n't tell the difference and after three minutes -- well if you really studied it you 'd see a difference but what happened when we looked inside the pig 's heart to the electrogram there was the baseline -- first of all a much bigger and more reliable signal second of all i 'll bet even you people who are untrained can see the difference and we see here an st segment elevation right after this sharp line look at the difference there it does n't take much -- every layperson could see that difference and computers can be programmed to easily detect it then look at that after three minutes we see that the signal that 's actually in the heart we can use it to tell people that they 're having a heart attack even before they have symptoms so we can save their life then we tried it with my son dr. tim fischell we tried it on some human patients who had to have a stent put in well he kept the balloon filled to block the artery to simulate a blockage which is what a heart attack is and it 's not hard to see that -- the baseline is the first picture on the upper left next to it at 30 seconds you see this rise here then this rise -- that 's the st elevation and if we had a computer that could detect it we could tell you you 're having a heart attack so early it could save your life and prevent congestive heart failure and then he did it again we filled the balloon again a few minutes later and here you see even after 10 seconds a great rise in this piece which we can have computers inside under your chest like a pacemaker with a wire into your heart like a pacemaker and computers do n't go to sleep we have a little battery and on this little battery that computer will run for five years without needing replacement what does the system look like well on the left is the imd which is implantable medical device and tonight in the tent you can see it -- they 've exhibited it it 's about this big the size of a pacemaker it 's implanted with very conventional techniques and the exd is an external device that you can have on your night table it 'll wake you up and tell you to get your tail to the emergency room when the thing goes off because if you do n't you 're in deep doo-doo and then finally a programmer that will set the level of the stimulation which is the level which says you are having a heart attack the fda says ok test this final device after it 's built in some animal which we said is a pig so we had to get this pig to have a heart attack and when you go to the farmyard you ca n't easily get pigs to have heart attacks so we said well we 're experts in stents tonight you 'll see some of our invented stents we said so we 'll put in a stent but we 're not going to put in a stent that we 'd put in people we 're putting in a copper stent and this copper stent erodes the artery and causes heart attacks that 's not very nice but after all we had to find out what the answer is so we took two copper stents and we put it in the artery of this pig and let me show you the result that 's very gratifying as far as people who have heart disease are concerned so there it was thursday morning we stopped the pig 's medication and there is his electrogram the signal from inside the pig 's heart coming out by radio telemetry then on friday at 6:43 he began to get certain signs which later we had the pig run around -- i 'm not going to go into this early stage but look what happened at 10:06 after we removed this pig 's medication that kept him from having a heart attack any one of you now is an expert on st elevation can you see it there can you see it in the picture after the big rise of the qrs -- you see st elevation this pig at 10:06 was having a heart attack what happens after you have the heart attack this blockage your rhythm becomes irregular and that 's what happened 45 minutes later then ventricular fibrillation the heart quivers instead of beats -- this is just before death of the pig -- and then the pig died ; it went flat-line but we had a little bit over an hour where we could 've saved this pig 's life well because of the fda we did n't save the pig 's life because we need to do this type of animal research for humans but when it comes to the sake of a human we can save their life we can save the lives of people who are at high risk for a heart attack what is the response to acute myocardial infarction a heart attack today well you feel some chest pain or indigestion it 's not all that bad ; you decide not to do anything several hours pass and it gets worse and even the man wo n't ignore it finally you go to the emergency room you wait as burns and other critical patients are treated because 75 percent of the patients who go to an emergency room with chest pains do n't have ami so you 're not taken very seriously they finally see you it takes more time to get your electrocardiogram on your skin and diagnose it and it 's hard to do because they do n't have the baseline data which the computer we put in you gets finally if you 're lucky you are treated in three or four hours after the incident but the heart muscle has died and that is the typical treatment in the advanced world -- not africa -- that 's the typical treatment in the advanced world today so we developed the angelmed guardian system and we have a device inside this patient called the implanted angelmed guardian and when you have a blockage the alarm goes off and it sends the alarm and the electrogram to an external device which gets your baseline electrogram from 24 hours ago and the one that caused the alarm so you can take it to the emergency room and show them and say take care of me right away then it goes to a network operations center where they get your data from your patient database that 's been put in at some central location say in the united states then it goes to a diagnostic center and within one minute of your heart attack your signal appears on the screen of a computer and the computer analyzes what your problem is and the person who 's there the medical practitioner calls you -- this is also a cell phone -- and says " mr. smith you 're in deep doo-doo ; you have a problem we 've called the ambulance the ambulance is on the way it 'll pick you up and then we 're going to call your doctor tell him about it we 're going to send him the signal that we have that says you have a heart attack and we 're going to send the signal to the hospital and we 're going to have it analyzed there and there you 're going to be with your doctor and you 'll be taken care of so you wo n't die of a heart attack " that 's the first invention that i wanted to describe and now i want to talk about something entirely different at first i did n't think migraine headaches were a big problem because i 'd never had a migraine headache but then i spoke to some people who have three or four every week of their life and their lives are being totally ruined by it we have a mission statement for our company doing migraine which is " prevent or ameliorate migraine headaches by the application of a safe controlled magnetic pulse applied as needed by the patient " now you 're probably very few physicists here if you 're a physicist you 'd know there 's a certain faraday 's law which says if i apply a magnetic pulse on salt water -- that 's your brains by the way -- it 'll generate electric currents and the electric current in the brain can erase a migraine headache that 's what we have discovered so here 's a picture of what we 're doing the patients who have a migraine preceded by an aura have a band of excited neurons -- that 's shown in red -- that moves at three to five millimeters a minute towards the mid-brain and when it hits the mid-brain that 's when the headache begins there 's this migraine that is preceded by a visual aura and this visual aura by the way -- and i 'll show you a picture -- but it sort of begins with little dancing lights gets bigger and bigger until it fills your whole visual field and what we tried was this ; here is a device called the cadwell model mes10 weighs about 70 pounds has a wire about an inch in diameter and here 's one of the patients who has an aura and always has a headache bad one after the aura what do we do this is what an aura looks like it 's sort of funny dancing lights shown there on the left and right side and that 's a fully developed visual aura as we see on top in the middle our experimentalist the neurologist who said " i 'm going to move this down a little and i 'm going to erase half your aura " and by god the neurologist did erase it and that 's the middle picture : half of the aura erased by a short magnetic pulse what does that mean that means that the magnetic pulse is generating an electric current that 's interfering with the erroneous electrical activity in the brain and finally he says " ok now i 'm going to -- " all of the aura get erased with an appropriately placed magnetic pulse what is the result we designed a magnetic depolarizer that looks like this that you could have -- a lady in her pocket book -- and when you get an aura you can try it and see how it works well the next thing they have to show is what was on abc news channel 7 last week in new york city in the 11 o'clock news anchor : for anyone who suffers from migraine headaches -- and there are 30 million americans who do -- tonight : a possible answer eyewitness news reporter stacy sager tonight with a small and portable machine that literally zaps your migraines away christina sidebottom : well my first reaction was that it was -- looked awfully gun-like and it was very strange stacy sager : but for christina sidebottom almost anything was worth trying if it could stop a migraine it may look silly or even frightening as you walk around with it in your purse but researchers here in ohio organizing clinical trials for this migraine zapper say it is scientifically sound -- that in fact when the average person gets a migraine it 's caused by something similar to an electrical impulse the zapper creates a magnetic field to counteract that yousef mohammed : in other words we 're treating electricity with electricity rather than treating electricity with the chemicals that we 're using nowadays ss : but is it safe to use everyday experts say the research has actually been around for more than a decade and more long-term studies need to be done christina now swears by it cs : it 's been the most wonderful thing for my migraine ss : researchers are hoping to present their studies to the fda this summer robert fischell : and that is the invention to treat migraines you see the problem is 30 million americans have migraine headaches and we need a means to treat it and i think that we now have it and this is the first device that we did and i 'm going to talk about my second wish which has something to do with this our conclusions from our studies so far at three research centers is there is a marked improvement in pain levels after using it just once the most severe headaches responded better after we did it several times and the unexpected finding indicates that even established headaches not only those with aura get treated and get diminished and auras can be erased and the migraine then does not occur and that is the migraine invention that we are talking about and that we are working on the third and last invention began with an idea epilepsy can best be treated by responsive electrical stimulation now why do we use -- add on nearly an epileptic focus now unfortunately us technical people unlike mr. bono have to get into all these technical words well " responsive electrical stimulation " means that we sense at a place in your brain which is called an " epileptic focus " which is where the epileptic seizure begins -- we sense there that it 's going to happen and then we respond by applying an electrical energy at that spot which erases the errant signal so that you do n't get the clinical manifestations of the migraine headache we use current pacemaker defibrillator technology that 's used for the heart we thought we could adapt it for the brain the device could be implanted under the scalp to be totally hidden and avoid wire breakage which occurs if you put it in the chest and you try to move your neck around form a company to develop a neuro-pacemaker for epilepsy as well as other diseases of the brain because all diseases of the brain are a result of some electrical malfunction in it that causes many if not all of brain disorders we formed a company called neuropace and we started work on responsive neurostimulation and this is a picture of what the device looked like that 's placed into the cranial bone this is probably a better picture here we have our device in which we put in a frame there 's a cut made in the scalp ; it 's opened ; the neurosurgeon has a template ; he marks it around and uses a dental burr to remove a piece of the cranial bone exactly the size of our device and tonight you 'll be able to see the device in the tent and then with four screws we put in a frame then we snap in the device and we run with wires -- the one shown in green will go to the surface of the brain with electrodes to the epileptic focus the origin of the epilepsy where we can sense the electrical signal and have computer analysis that tells us when to hit it with some electrical current to prevent the clinical manifestation of the seizure in the blue wire we see what 's called a deep brain electrode if that 's the source of the epilepsy we can attack that as well the comprehensive solution : this is the device ; it 's about one inches by two inches and oddly enough just the thickness of most cranial bones the advantages of responsive neurostimulation : it can detect and terminate seizures before the clinical symptoms occur provide stimulation only when needed can be turned off if seizures disappear ; it has minimal side effects -- as a matter of fact in all our clinical trials to date we 've seen no side effects in the 40 or so patients in whom it 's been implanted -- and it 's invisible cosmetically hidden so if you have epilepsy and you have the device no one will know it because you ca n't tell that it 's there and this shows what an electroencephalogram is and on the left is the signal of a spontaneous seizure of one of the patients then we stimulated and you see how that heavy black line and then you see the electroencephalogram signal going to normal which means they did not get the epileptic seizure that concludes my discussion of epilepsy which is the third invention that i want to discuss here this afternoon i have three wishes well i ca n't do much about africa i 'm a tech ; i 'm into medical gadgetry which is mostly high-tech stuff like mr. bono talked about the first wish is to use the epilepsy responsive neurostimulator called rns for responsive neurostimulator -- that 's a brilliant acronym -- for the treatment of other brain disorders well if we 're going to do it for epilepsy why the hell not try it for something else then you saw what that device looked like that the woman was using to fix her migraines i tell you this : that 's something which some research engineer like me would concoct not a real designer of good equipment we want to have some people who really know how to do this perform human engineering studies to develop the optimum design for the portable device for treating migraine headaches and some of the sponsors of this ted meeting are such organizations then we 're going to challenge the ted attendees to come up with a way to improve health care in the usa where we have problems that africa does n't have and by reducing malpractice litigation -- malpractice litigation is not an african problem ; it 's an american problem so to get quickly to my first wish -- the brain operates by electrical signals if the electrical signals create a brain disorder electro-stimulation can overcome that disorder by acting on the brain 's neurons in other words if you 've screwed up electrical signals maybe by putting other electrical signals from a computer in the brain we can counteract that a signal in the brain that triggers brain dysfunction might be sensed as a trigger for electro-stimulation like we 're doing with epilepsy but even if there is no signal electro-stimulation of an appropriate part of the brain can turn off a brain disorder and consider treating psychotic disorders -- and i want this involved with the ted group -- such as obsessive-compulsive disorder that presently is not well treated with drugs and includes five million americans and mr. fischer and his group at neuropace and myself believe that we can have a dramatic effect in improving ocd in america and in the world that is the first wish the second wish is at the present time the clinical trials of transcranial magnetic stimulators -- that 's what tms means device to treat migraine headaches -- appears to be quite successful well that 's the good news the present portable device is far from optimally designed both as to human factors as appearance i think she said it looks like a gun a lot of people do n't like guns engage a company having prior successes for human factors engineering and industrial design to optimize the design of the first portable tms device that will be sold to the patients who have migraine headaches and that is the second wish and of the 100,000-dollar prize money that ted was so generous to give me i am donating 50,000 dollars to the neuropace people to get on with the treatment of ocd obsessive-compulsive disorder and i 'm making another 50,000 available for a company to optimize the design of the device for migraines and that 's how i 'll use my 100,000-dollar prize money well the third and final wish is somewhat -- unfortunately it 's much more complicated because it involves lawyers well medical malpractice litigation in the us has escalated the cost of malpractice insurance so that competent physicians are leaving their practice lawyers take cases on contingency with the hope of a big share of a big settlement by a sympathetic jury because this patient really ended up badly the high cost of health care in the us is partly due to litigation and insurance costs i 've seen pictures graphs in today 's usa today showing it skyrocketing out of control and this is one factor well how can the ted community help with this situation i have a couple of ideas to begin with as a starting point for discussion with the ted group a major part of the problem is the nature of the written extent of informed consent that the patient or spouse must read and sign for example i asked the epilepsy people what are they using for informed consent would you believe 12 pages single space the patient has to read before they 're in our trial to cure their epilepsy what do you think someone has at the end of reading 12 single-spaced pages they do n't understand what the hell it 's about that 's the present system how about making a video we have entertainment people here ; we have people who know how to do videos with visual presentation of the anatomy and procedure done with animation everybody knows that we can do better with a visual thing that can be interactive with the patient where they see the video and they 're being videoed and they press do you understand this no i do n't well then let 's go to a simpler explanation then there 's a simpler one and oh yes i understand that well press the button and you 're on record you understand and that is one of the ideas now also a video is done of the patient or spouse and medical presenter with the patient agreeing that he understands the procedure to be done including all the possible failure modes the patient or spouse agrees not to file a lawsuit if one of the known procedure failures occurs now in america in fact you can not give up your right to trial by jury however if a video is there that everything was explained to you and you have it all in the video file it 'll be much less likely that some hotshot lawyer will take this case on contingency because it wo n't be nearly as good a case if a medical error occurs the patient or spouse agrees to a settlement for fair compensation by arbitration instead of going to court that would save hundreds of millions of dollars in legal costs in the united states and would decrease the cost of medicine for everyone these are just some starting points and so there that 's the end of all my wishes i wish i had more wishes but three is what i 've got and there they are i just want to say over the last few years i 've been -- had the opportunity to do this closing conference and i 've had some incredible warm-up acts about eight years ago billy graham opened for me and i thought that there was -- i thought that there was absolutely no way in hell to top that but i just wanted to say -- and i mean this without irony -- i think i can speak for everybody in the audience when i say that i wish to god that you were the president of the united states ok this is the title of my talk today i just want to give you a quick overview first of all please remember i 'm completely politically correct and i mean everything with great affection if any of you have sensitive stomachs or are feeling queasy now is the time to check your blackberry just to review this is my tedtalk we 're going to do some jokes some gags some little skits -- and then we 're going to talk about the l1 point so one of the questions i ask myself is was this the most distressing ted ever let 's try and sum things up shall we images of limb regeneration and faces filled with smallpox : 21 percent of the conference mentions of polar bears drowning : four percent images of the earth being wiped out by flood or bird flu : 64 percent and david pogue singing show tunes because this is the most distressing ted ever i 've been working with neil gershenfeld on next year 's ted bag and if the -- if the conference is anywhere near this distressing then we 're going to have a scream bag next year it 's going to be a cradle-to-cradle scream bag of course so you 're going to be able to go like this bring it over here and open it up aaaah ! meanwhile back at ted university this wonderful woman is teaching you how to chop sun chips so robert wright -- i do n't know i felt like if there was anyone that helen needed to give antidepressants to it might have been him i want to deliberately interfere with his dopamine levels he was talking about morality economy class morality is we want to bomb you back to the stone age business class morality is do n't bomb japan -- they built my car and first-class morality is do n't bomb mexico -- they clean my house yes it is politically incorrect all right now i want to do a little bit of a thing for you â€¦ all right now these are the wha -- i 'd say [ mumble mumble -- mumble mumble mumble mumble mumble ] -- ahh ! so i wanted to show you guys -- i wanted to talk about a revolutionary new computer interface that lets you work with images just as easily as you -- as a completely natural user interface and you can -- you can use really natural hand gestures to like go like this now we had a harvard professor here -- she was from harvard i just wanted to mention and -- and she was actually a professor from harvard and she was talking about seven-dimensional inverted universes with you know of course there 's the gravity brain there 's the weak brain and then there 's my weak brain which is too -- too -- absolutely too weak to understand what the fuck she was talking about now -- one of the things that is very important to me is to try and figure out what on earth am i here for and that 's why i went out and i picked up a best-selling business book you know it basically uses as its central premise greek mythology and it 's by a guy named pastor rick warren and it 's called " the porpoise driven life " and rick is as a pagan god which i thought was kind of appropriate in a certain way and now we 're going to have kind of a little more visualization about rick warren ok. all right now red is rick warren and green is daniel dennett ok the scales here are religiosity from zero percent or atheist to 100 percent bible literally true and then this is books sold -- the logarithmic scale 30,000 300,000 three million 30 million 300 million ok now they 're duking it out now they 're duking it out and rick warren 's kind of pulling ahead kind of pulling ahead yup and his installed base is getting a little bigger but darwin 's dangerous idea is coming back it 's coming back let me turn the trails on so you can see that a little bit better now one of the things that 's very important is nicholas negroponte talked to us about one lap dance per -- i 'm sorry -- about one laptop per child now let 's talk about some of the characteristics that are important for this revolutionary device i 'll tell you a little bit about the design parameters and then i 'll show it to you in person first of all it needs to be small it needs to be flat so it 's transportable lightweight portable uses very very little power very very high resolution has to be visible in bright daylight will work anywhere and broadly applicable across many platforms now we 've actually done some research -- neil gershenfeld and the fab labs went out into the market they did some research ; we came back ; and we think we have the perfect prototype of what the students in the field are actually asking for and here it is the $ 100 computer ok ok ok ok -- excellent excellent now i bought this device from clifford stoll for about 900 bucks and he and his team of junior-high school students were doing real science so we 're trying to check and trying to douse here and see who uses marijuana see who uses marijuana are we going to be able to find any marijuana jim young only if we open enough locker doors ok now smallpox is an extremely distressing illness we had dr. larry brilliant talking about how we eradicated smallpox i wanted to show you the stages of smallpox we start this is day one day two day three she gets a massively big pox on her shoulder day three day four day five and day six now the good news is because i 'm a trained medical professional i know that even though she 'll be scarred for life she 's going to make a full recovery now the good news about architects for humanity is they 're really kind of the most amazing group they 've been sponsoring a design competition to come up with innovative medical housing solutions clinic solutions in africa and they 've had a design competition now the wonderful thing is larry brilliant was just appointed the head of the google foundation and so he decided that he would support -- he would support cameron 's work and the way he decided to support that work was by shipping over 50,000 shipping containers of google snacks so i want to show you some prototypes the u.n. -- you know they took 20 years just to add a flap to a tent but i think we have some more exciting things this is a home made entirely out of fruit roll-ups and those roll-up cookies coated with white chocolate and the really wonderful thing about this is when you 're done well -- you can eat it but the thing that i 'm really really excited about is this incredible granola house and the granola house has a special sun chip roof to collect water and recycle it and it 's -- well on this side it has regular sour patch kids and gummy bears to let in the light but on this side it has sugary gummy bears to diffuse the light more slightly and we -- we wanted just to show you what this might look like in situ so einstein -- einstein tell me -- what 's your favorite song no i said what 's your favorite song no i said what 's your favorite song " free bird " ok so einstein what 's your favorite singing group could you say that again what 's your favorite singing group ok one more time -- i 'm just going to give you a little help your favorite singing group -- it 's diana ross and the -- audience : supremes ! tom reilly : exactly could we have the sound up on the laptop please " free bird " kind of reminds me that if you -- if you listen to " free bird " backwards this is what you might hear computer : satan satan satan satan satan satan satan tr : now it 's a little hard to hear the whole message so i wanted to -- so i wanted to help you a little bit computer : my sweet satan dan dennett worships satan buy " the purpose-driven life " or satan will take your soul tr : so we 've talked a lot about global warming but you know as jill said it sounds kind of nice -- good weather in the wintertime and new york city and as jay walker pointed out that is just not scary enough so al i actually think i 'm rather good at branding so i 've tried to figure out a good design process to come up with a new term to replace " global warming " so we started with babel fish we put in global warming and then we decided that we 'd change it from english to dutch -- into " het globale verwarmen " from dutch to chinese into " hordahordaneecheewa " chinese to portuguese : aquecer-se global then portuguese to pig latin aquecer-se ucked-fay and then finally back into the english which is we 're totally fucked now i do n't know about you but michael shermer talked about the willingness for human beings -- evolutionarily they 're designed to see patterns in things for example in cheese sandwiches now can you look at that carefully and see if you see the virgin mary i tried to make it a little bit clearer is it the virgin mary or is it mena trott so i talked to josh prince-ramus about the convention center and the conferences it 's getting awfully big it 's getting just a little bit too big it 's bursting at the seams here a little bit so we tried to come up with a program -- how we could remake this structure to better accommodate ted so first of all we decided -- that we needed about one-third bookstore one-third google cafe about 20 percent registration 80 percent luxury hotel about five percent for restrooms and then of course we wanted to have the simulcast lounge the lobby and the steinbeck forum now let me show you how that literally translated into the design program so first one of the problems with monterey is that if there is global warming and greenland melts as you say the ocean level is going to rise 20 feet and flood the hell out of the convention center so we 're going to build this new building on stilts so we build this building on stilts then up here -- is where we 're going to put the new steinbeck auditorium and the wonderful thing about the new bookstore is it 's going to be shaped in a spiral that 's organized by the dewey decimal system then we 're going to make an escalator that helps you get up there and finally we 're going to put the marriott hotel and the portola plaza on the top now i do n't know about you but sometimes i have these images in my head of separated at birth i do n't know about you but when i see aubrey de grey i immediately go to gandalf the grey ok. now we 've heard of course that we 're all soldiers here so what i 'd really really like you to do now is pick up your white piece of paper does everybody have their white piece of paper and i want you to get out a pen and i want you to write a terrorist note if we put up the elmo for a moment -- if we put up the elmo then we 'll get you know i 'll give you a model that you can work from ok and then i want you to fold that note into a paper airplane and once you 've folded it into a paper airplane i want you to take some anthrax -- and i want you to put that in the paper airplane and then i want you to throw it on jim young luckily i was the recipient of the ted prize this year and i wanted to see -- i want to dedicate this film to my father homer ok. now this film is n't really hard enough so i wanted to make it a little bit harder so i 'm going to try and do this while reciting pi 3.1415 2657 753 8567 24972 -- -- 85871 25871 3928 5657 2592 5624 can we cue the music please now i wanted to use this talk to talk about global warming a little bit back in 1968 you can see that the mountain range of brokeback mountain was covered in 151 inches of snow pack parenthetically over there on the slopes i did want to show you that black men ski but over the years 10 years later the snow packs eroded and if you notice the trees have started turning yellow the water level of the lake has started drying up a few years later there 's no snow left at all and all the trees have turned brown this year unfortunately the lakebed 's turned into an absolute cracked dry bed and i fear if we do nothing for our planet in 20 years it 's going to look like this mr. vice president i wish i knew how to quit you thank you very much " the better man " i was the better at getting and keeping you were the better at spend and spend ; i was the better at grubbing and heaping but who was the better man in the end yes who was the better man my friend you were the better with lords and ladies i was the better at pillaging troy ; you were the better at kissing the babies i was the better at search and destroy but who was the better man old boy who was the better man i was the better at improvisation you were the better at spinning the plates ; i was the better at procrastination you were the better at quiet debate but who was the better man old mate who was the better man you were the better at rolling a reefer i was the better at coke and rum ; remember that night on the beach in ibiza the maori twins with the tattooed bum but who was the better man old chum who was the better man now we come down to it relatives grieving out in the hall with their crocodile tears ; now that you 're out of it now that you 're leaving now that they 've sealed your arse and your ears what i 've been meaning to tell you for years and years and years and years old friend â€¦ is that you were the better man in the end ; you were the better man my friend i wrote this next poem for my mother every one of us had a mother only one -- probably the most important person in your life if you 're lucky enough to know them my mother was certainly the most important in mine let me try and describe her to you she 's 86 years old she 's frail white platinum hair why do they do that why do old ladies go to those hair shops and make those helmets bright as a button all the ducks in a row looks like a much prettier version of margaret thatcher but without any of the soft bits in margaret 's character i wrote this poem for her these are not my beliefs but my mother has lived by this creed all her life " never go back " never go back never go back never return to the haunts of your youth keep to the track to the beaten track ; memory holds all you need of the truth never look back never look back never succumb to the gorgon 's stare keep to the track to the beaten track ; no-one is waiting and nothing is there never go back never go back never surrender the future you earned keep to the track to the beaten track ; never return to the bridges you 've burned never look back never look back never retreat to the 'glorious past ' keep to the track to the beaten track ; treat every day of your life as your last never go back never go back never acknowledge the ghost on the stair keep to the track to the beaten track ; no-one is waiting and nothing is there now ladies and gentlemen i 'm up on me hobbyhorse if every commercially minded cosmetic surgeon were tied end to end along a railroad track that would be me stoking the train without a qualm in the world ladies do n't do it do n't do it you think we want you to do it but we do n't want you to do it stop it tell them to go to hell you bodies are wonderful as they are just leave them alone " to a beautiful lady of a certain age " lady lady do not weep what is gone is gone now sleep turn your pillow dry your tears count thy sheep and not thy years nothing good can come of this time rules all my dearest 't is but folly to be waging war on one who never lost before lady this is all in vain youth can never come again ; we have drunk the summer wine none can make a stitch in time nip and tuck till crack of doom what is foretold in the womb may not be foresworn with gold nor may time be bought or sold dearest do i love thee less do i shrink from thy caress think you i could cease to care never was there one so fair ! lady lady do not weep -- what is gone is gone now sleep lean against me calm your fears count thy blessings not thy years america ladies and gentlemen has done more for me financially than britain ever has or ever could have done i was born in britain as you have probably guessed even when on its worst behavior i find myself automatically defending the usa from the sneers of green-eyed europhiles playing their greek card to roman trumps america is an empire i hope you know that now all empires by definition are bumbling shambolic bullying bureaucratic affairs as certain of the rightness of their cause in infancy as they are corrupted by power in their dotage i am no historian ladies and gentlemen but it seems to be that the usa 's sins compared to those of many previous empires are of a more moderate if more pervasive kind let me put this bluntly if americans are so fat stupid and ignorant my dear friends from birmingham how come they rule the world " hail to the gods of america " hail to the gods of america ! hail to the gods of the dream invictus e pluribus unum but which of them reigns supreme which is america 's jupiter the brahmins of capital hill a sorcerer 's profit on wall street they eye of a dollar bill or is it celebrity status the worship of those we hate or the cult of living forever if only we 'd watch our weight what of the titans of media or hollywood 's siren call what of the temples of justice whose servants enslave us all what of the brand and the label what of the upstart sport and what of the constitution that bully of last resort hail to the god of america whose power the masses extol -- convenience rules america ; convenience owns our soul aye that it does and if you would like to know why i am not a father -- i who by a miracle have 22 godchildren -- the answer is in this poem which upsets me every time i read it " love came to visit me " love came to visit me shy as a fawn but finding me busy she fled with the dawn at 20 the torch of resentment was lit my rage at injustice waxed hot as the pits the flux of its lava cleared all in its path comrades and enemies fled from its wrath yet lovers grew wary once novelty waned to lie with a bloody man his terror unfeigned at 30 my powers seemed mighty to me the fruits of my rivals i shook from the tree by guile and by bluster by night and by day i battered and scattered the fools from my way and women grew willing to sham and to bluff their trinkets and baubles cost little enough from 40 to 50 grown easy and sly i wined them and dined them like pigs in a sty we feasted and reveled and rutted in muck forgetting our peril forgetting to duck forgetting times arrows are sharper than knives grown sick to our stomachs and sick of our lives love came to visit me shy as a fawn but finding me busy she fled with the dawn um there are -- i 've got far too much money and i have far too much fun in my businesses so poetry came as a complete shock to me ladies and gentlemen a complete shock i was a little ill okay i was ill okay i had a life-threatening illness you know i was in a clinic i was n't allowed to make telephone calls i was n't allowed to see any of my -- you know whatever so in the end i begged a pack of post-it notes off a nurse and from another nurse i begged a pencil pen and i did n't know what else to do so i started to write poetry that was in october of 2000 i 'm not an evil man but sometimes i try to put myself in an evil man 's position i 'm not a glorious and fantastic-looking woman who men fall down you know when she walks in a room but sometimes i try to put myself in that position not with much success but it 's interesting to me i love to write historical verse i love to think what they thought what it was like because although many of the speakers and many of the people who are in the audience although you guys can not only go to the moon you know you 're going to totally transform everything cloning will transform everything voice navigation will transform everything i do n't know you can do anything you want all you guys are so clever and women you can do it all ! but human nature does n't change mate my friends human nature is exactly the same as it was when my ancestor -- probably it was my ancestor -- got his hands around the neck of the last neanderthal and battered the bastard to death you think we did n't do that oh we did we killed every single one of them inch by inch we killed them we hunted them down wherever they were rivals for meat rivals for berries we 're still doing it with all of the genius assembled in this room our natures have n't changed a single iota and they never will even when we 've got off this little planet and have put some of our eggs in some other baskets and i am as bad as you i spent eight years running one of the most successful publishing businesses in the world and at seven o'clock every night i took me some more girls already corrupted i never did anything to anyone that was n't and i took crack cocaine every single night for seven years it was like dante 's " inferno " it was unbelievable one of the offshoots of crack cocaine is that you keep an erection for about four hours and you stay up for 12 it was absolutely unbelievable twenty-two godchildren i 've got what do i say to them i only stopped because i thought if i got caught what would happen to my mother if you 're a woman remember that the love of your son can utterly transform anything he does " our lady in white " pale she was listless ; and soft to the touch a generous mistress whom many loved much shoulder to shoulder night after night we hoarded and sold her -- our lady in white we breathed but to savor her crystal caress we craved but to favor the hem of her dress we dabbled and babbled denying our thirsts but always we scrabbled to lie with her first absent we missed her grew haggard and limp toyed with her sister or threatened her pimp came word out of babel the lady returns ! and there on the table we took her in turns sensing the power that tyranny craves there in that hour she made us her slaves many there were to covet her kiss my shame as a spur i fled the abyss but only just so a big question that we 're facing now and have been for quite a number of years now : are we at risk of a nuclear attack now there 's a bigger question that 's probably actually more important than that is the notion of permanently eliminating the possibility of a nuclear attack eliminating the threat altogether and i would like to make a case to you that over the years since we first developed atomic weaponry until this very moment we 've actually lived in a dangerous nuclear world that 's characterized by two phases which i 'm going to go through with you right now first of all we started off the nuclear age in 1945 the united states had developed a couple of atomic weapons through the manhattan project and the idea was very straightforward : we would use the power of the atom to end the atrocities and the horror of this unending world war ii that we 'd been involved in in europe and in the pacific and in 1945 we were the only nuclear power we had a few nuclear weapons two of which we dropped on japan in hiroshima a few days later in nagasaki in august 1945 killing about 250,000 people between those two and for a few years we were the only nuclear power on earth but by 1949 the soviet union had decided it was unacceptable to have us as the only nuclear power and they began to match what the united states had developed and from 1949 to 1985 was an extraordinary time of a buildup of a nuclear arsenal that no one could possibly have imagined back in the 1940s so by 1985 -- each of those red bombs up here is equivalent of a thousands warheads -- the world had 65,000 nuclear warheads and seven members of something that came to be known as the " nuclear club " and it was an extraordinary time and i am going to go through some of the mentality that we -- that americans and the rest of the world were experiencing but i want to just point out to you that 95 percent of the nuclear weapons at any particular time since 1985 -- going forward of course -- were part of the arsenals of the united states and the soviet union after 1985 and before the break up of the soviet union we began to disarm from a nuclear point of view we began to counter-proliferate and we dropped the number of nuclear warheads in the world to about a total of 21,000 it 's a very difficult number to deal with because what we 've done is we 've quote unquote " decommissioned " some of the warheads they 're still probably usable they could be " re-commissioned " but the way they count things which is very complicated we think we have about a third of the nuclear weapons we had before but we also in that period of time added two more members to the nuclear club : pakistan and north korea so we stand today with a still fully armed nuclear arsenal among many countries around the world but a very different set of circumstances so i 'm going to talk about a nuclear threat story in two chapters chapter one is 1949 to 1991 when the soviet union broke up and what we were dealing with at that point and through those years was a superpowers ' nuclear arms race it was characterized by a nation-versus-nation very fragile standoff and basically we lived for all those years and some might argue that we still do in a situation of being on the brink literally of an apocalyptic planetary calamity it 's incredible that we actually lived through all that we were totally dependent during those years on this amazing acronym which is mad it stands for mutually assured destruction so it meant if you attacked us we would attack you virtually simultaneously and the end result would be a destruction of your country and mine so the threat of my own destruction kept me from launching a nuclear attack on you that 's the way we lived and the danger of that of course is that a misreading of a radar screen could actually cause a counter-launch even though the first country had not actually launched anything during this chapter one there was a high level of public awareness about the potential of nuclear catastrophe and an indelible image was implanted in our collective minds that in fact a nuclear holocaust would be absolutely globally destructive and could in some ways mean the end of civilization as we know it so this was chapter one now the odd thing is that even though we knew that there would be that kind of civilization obliteration we engaged in america in a series -- and in fact in the soviet union -- in a series of response planning it was absolutely incredible so premise one is we 'd be destroying the world and then premise two is why do n't we get prepared for it so what we offered ourselves was a collection of things i 'm just going to go skim through a few things just to jog your memories if you 're born after 1950 this is just -- consider this entertainment otherwise it 's memory lane this was bert the turtle this was basically an attempt to teach our schoolchildren that if we did get engaged in a nuclear confrontation and atomic war then we wanted our school children to kind of basically duck and cover that was the principle you -- there would be a nuclear conflagration about to hit us and if you get under your desk things would be ok i did n't do all that well in psychiatry in medical school but i was interested and i think this was seriously delusional secondly we told people to go down in their basements and build a fallout shelter maybe it would be a study when we were n't having an atomic war or you could use it as a tv room or as many teenagers found out a very very safe place for a little privacy with your girlfriend and actually -- so there are multiple uses of the bomb shelters or you could buy a prefabricated bomb shelter that you could simply bury in the ground now the bomb shelters at that point -- let 's say you bought a prefab one -- it would be a few hundred dollars maybe up to 500 if you got a fancy one yet what percentage of americans do you think ever had a bomb shelter in their house what percentage lived in a house with a bomb shelter less than two percent about 1.4 percent of the population as far as anyone knows did anything either making a space in their basement or actually building a bomb shelter many buildings public buildings around the country -- this is new york city -- had these little civil defense signs and the idea was that you would run into one of these shelters and be safe from the nuclear weaponry and one of the greatest governmental delusions of all time was something that happened in the early days of the federal emergency management agency fema as we now know and are well aware of their behaviors from katrina here is their first big public announcement they would propose -- actually there were about six volumes written on this -- a crisis relocation plan that was dependent upon the united states having three to four days warning that the soviets were going to attack us so the goal was to evacuate the target cities we would move people out of the target cities into the countryside and i 'm telling you i actually testified at the senate about the absolute ludicrous idea that we would actually evacuate and actually have three or four days ' warning it was just completely off the wall turns out that they had another idea behind it even though this was -- they were telling the public it was to save us the idea was that we would force the soviets to re-target their nuclear weapons -- very expensive -- and potentially double their arsenal to not only take out the original site but take out sites where people were going this was what apparently as it turns out was behind all this it was just really really frightening the main point here is we were dealing with a complete disconnect from reality the civil defense programs were disconnected from the reality of what we 'd see in all-out nuclear war so organizations like physicians for social responsibility around 1979 started saying this a lot publicly they would do a bombing run they 'd go to your city and they 'd say " here 's a map of your city here 's what 's going to happen if we get a nuclear hit " so no possibility of medical response to or meaningful preparedness for all-out nuclear war so we had to prevent nuclear war if we expected to survive this disconnect was never actually resolved and what happened was -- when we get in to chapter two of the nuclear threat era which started back in 1945 chapter two starts in 1991 when the soviet union broke up we effectively lost that adversary as a potential attacker of the united states for the most part it 's not completely gone i 'm going to come back to that but from 1991 through the present time emphasized by the attacks of 2001 the idea of an all-out nuclear war has diminished and the idea of a single event act of nuclear terrorism is what we have instead although the scenario has changed very considerably the fact is that we have n't changed our mental image of what a nuclear war means so i 'm going to tell you what the implications of that are in just a second so what is a nuclear terror threat and there 's four key ingredients to describing that first thing is that the global nuclear weapons in the stockpiles that i showed you in those original maps happen to be not uniformly secure and it 's particularly not secure in the former soviet union now in russia there are many many sites where warheads are stored and in fact lots of sites where fissionable materials like highly enriched uranium and plutonium are absolutely not safe they 're available to be bought stolen whatever they 're acquirable let me put it that way from 1993 through 2006 the international atomic energy agency documented 175 cases of nuclear theft 18 of which involved highly enriched uranium or plutonium the key ingredients to make a nuclear weapon the global stockpile of highly enriched uranium is about 1,300 at the low end to about 2,100 metric tons more than 100 megatons of this is stored in particularly insecure russian facilities how much of that do you think it would take to actually build a 10-kiloton bomb well you need about 75 pounds of it so what i 'd like to show you is what it would take to hold 75 pounds of highly enriched uranium this is not a product placement it 's just -- in fact if i was coca cola i 'd be pretty distressed about this -- -- but basically this is it this is what you would need to steal or buy out of that 100-metric-ton stockpile that 's relatively insecure to create the type of bomb that was used in hiroshima now you might want to look at plutonium as another fissionable material that you might use in a bomb that -- you 'd need 10 to 13 pounds of plutonium now plutonium 10 to 13 pounds : this this is enough plutonium to create a nagasaki-size atomic weapon now this situation already i -- you know i do n't really like thinking about this although somehow i got myself a job where i have to think about it so the point is that we 're very very insecure in terms of developing this material the second thing is what about the know-how and there 's a lot of controversy about whether terror organizations have the know-how to actually make a nuclear weapon well there 's a lot of know-how out there there 's an unbelievable amount of know-how out there there 's detailed information on how to assemble a nuclear weapon from parts there 's books about how to build a nuclear bomb there are plans for how to create a terror farm where you could actually manufacture and develop all the components and assemble it all of this information is relatively available if you have an undergraduate degree in physics i would suggest -- although i do n't so maybe it 's not even true -- but something close to that would allow you with the information that 's currently available to actually build a nuclear weapon the third element of the nuclear terror threat is that who would actually do such a thing well what we 're seeing now is a level of terrorism that involves individuals who are highly organized they are very dedicated and committed they are stateless somebody once said al qaeda does not have a return address so if they attack us with a nuclear weapon what 's the response and to whom is the response and they 're retaliation-proof since there is no real retribution possible that would make any difference since there are people willing to actually give up their lives in order to do a lot of damage to us it becomes apparent that the whole notion of this mutually assured destruction would not work here is sulaiman abu ghaith and sulaiman was a key lieutenant of osama bin laden he wrote many many times statements to this effect : " we have the right to kill four million americans two million of whom should be children " and we do n't have to go overseas to find people willing to do harm for whatever their reasons mcveigh and nichols and the oklahoma city attack in the 1990s was a good example of homegrown terrorists what if they had gotten their hands on a nuclear weapon the fourth element is that the high-value u.s. targets are accessible soft and plentiful this would be a talk for another day but the level of the preparedness that the united states has achieved since 9/11 of '01 is unbelievably inadequate what you saw after katrina is a very good indicator of how little prepared the united states is for any kind of major attack seven million ship cargo containers come into the united states every year five to seven percent only are inspected -- five to seven percent this is alexander lebed who was a general that worked with yeltsin who talked about and presented to congress this idea that the russians had developed -- these suitcase bombs they were very low yield -- 0.1 to one kiloton hiroshima was around 13 kilotons -- but enough to do an unbelievable amount of damage and lebed came to the united states and told us that many many -- more than 80 of the suitcase bombs were actually not accountable and they look like this they 're basically very simple arrangements you put the elements into a suitcase it becomes very portable the suitcase can be conveniently dropped in your trunk of your car you take it wherever you want to take it and you can detonate it you do n't want to build a suitcase bomb and you happen to get one of those insecure nuclear warheads that exist this is the size of the " little boy " bomb that was dropped at hiroshima it was 9.8 feet long weighed 8,800 pounds you go down to your local rent-a-truck and for 50 bucks or so you rent a truck that 's got the right capacity and you take your bomb you put it in the truck and you 're ready to go it could happen but what it would mean and who would survive you ca n't get an exact number for that kind of probability but what i 'm trying to say is that we have all the elements of that happening anybody who dismisses the thought of a nuclear weapon being used by a terrorist is kidding themselves i think there 's a lot of people in the intelligence community -- a lot of people who deal with this work in general think it 's almost inevitable unless we do certain things to really try to defuse the risk like better interdiction better prevention better fixing you know better screening of cargo containers that are coming into the country and so forth there 's a lot that can be done to make us a lot safer at this particular moment we actually could end up seeing a nuclear detonation in one of our cities i do n't think we would see an all-out nuclear war any time soon although even that is not completely off the table there 's still enough nuclear weapons in the arsenals of the superpowers to destroy the earth many many times over there are flash points in india and pakistan in the middle east in north korea other places where the use of nuclear weapons while initially locally could very rapidly where we 'd be facing all-out nuclear war it 's very unsettling here we go ok i 'm back in my truck and we drove over the brooklyn bridge we 're coming down and we bring that truck that you just saw somewhere in here in the financial district this is a 10-kiloton bomb slightly smaller than was used in hiroshima and i want to just conclude this by just giving you some information i think -- " news you could use " kind of concept here so first of all this would be horrific beyond anything we can possibly imagine this is the ultimate and if you 're in the half-mile radius of where this bomb went off you have a 90 percent chance of not making it if you 're right where the bomb went off you will be vaporized and that 's -- i 'm just telling you this is not good you assume that two-mile radius you have a 50 percent chance of being killed and up to about eight miles away -- now i 'm talking about killed instantly -- somewhere between a 10 and 20 percent chance of getting killed the thing about this is that the experience of the nuclear detonation is -- first of all tens of millions of degrees fahrenheit at the core here where it goes off and an extraordinary amount of energy in the form of heat acute radiation and blast effects an enormous hurricane-like wind and destruction of buildings almost totally within this yellow circle here and what i 'm going to focus on as i come to conclusion here is that what happens to you if you 're in here well if we 're talking about the old days of an all-out nuclear attack you up here are as dead as the people here so it was a moot point my point now though is that there is a lot that we could do for you who are in here if you 've survived the initial blast you have when the blast goes off -- and by the way if it ever comes up do n't look at it if you look at it you 're going to be blind either temporarily or permanently so if there 's any way that you can avoid like avert your eyes that would be a good thing if you find yourself alive but you 're in the vicinity of a nuclear weapon you have -- that 's gone off -- you have 10 to 20 minutes depending on the size and exactly where it went off to get out of the way before a lethal amount of radiation comes straight down from the mushroom cloud that goes up in that 10 to 15 minutes all you have to do -- and i mean this seriously -- is go about a mile away from the blast and what happens is -- this is -- i 'm going to show you now some fallout plumes within 20 minutes it comes straight down within 24 hours lethal radiation is going out with prevailing winds and it 's mostly in this particular direction -- it 's going northeast and if you 're in this vicinity you 've got to get away so you 're feeling the wind -- and this tremendous wind now that you 're going to be feeling -- and you want to go perpendicular to the wind or downwind if you are in fact able to see where the blast was in front of you you 've got to get out of there if you do n't get out of there you 're going to be exposed to lethal radiation in very short order if you ca n't get out of there we want you to go into a shelter and stay there now in a shelter in an urban area means you have to be either in a basement as deep as possible or you have to be on a floor -- on a high floor -- if it 's a ground burst explosion which it would be higher than the ninth floor so you have to be tenth floor or higher or in the basement but basically you 've got to get out of town as quickly as possible and if you do that you actually can survive a nuclear blast over the next few days to a week there will be a radiation cloud again going with the wind and settling down for another 15 or 20 miles out -- in this case over long island and if you 're in the direct fallout zone here you really have to either be sheltered or you have to get out of there and that 's clear but if you are sheltered you can actually survive the difference between knowing information of what you 're going to do personally and not knowing information can save your life and it could mean the difference between 150,000 to 200,000 fatalities from something like this and half a million to 700,000 fatalities so response planning in the twenty-first century is both possible and is essential but in 2008 there is n't one single american city that has done effective plans to deal with a nuclear detonation disaster part of the problem is that the emergency planners themselves personally are overwhelmed psychologically by the thought of nuclear catastrophe they are paralyzed you say " nuclear " to them and they 're thinking " oh my god we 're all gone what 's the point it 's futile " and we 're trying to tell them " it 's not futile we can change the survival rates by doing some commonsensical things " so the goal here is to minimize fatalities and i just want to leave you with the personal points that i think you might be interested in the key to surviving a nuclear blast is getting out and not going into harm 's way that 's basically all we 're going to be talking about here and the farther you are away in distance the longer it is in time from the initial blast ; and the more separation between you and the outside atmosphere the better so separation -- hopefully with dirt or concrete or being in a basement -- distance and time is what will save you so here 's what you do first of all as i said do n't stare at the light flash if you can i do n't know you could possibly resist doing that but let 's assume theoretically you want to do that you want to keep your mouth open so your eardrums do n't burst from the pressures if you 're very close to what happened you actually do have to duck and cover like bert told you bert the turtle and you want to get under something so that you 're not injured or killed by objects if that 's at all possible you want to get away from the initial fallout mushroom cloud i said in just a few minutes and shelter and place you want to move downwind or crosswind for 1.2 miles you know if you 're out there and you see buildings horribly destroyed and down in that direction less destroyed here then you know that it was over there the blast and you 're going this way as long as you 're going crosswise to the wind once you 're out and evacuating you want to keep as much of your skin your mouth and nose covered as long as that covering does n't impede you moving and getting out of there and finally you want to get decontaminated as soon as possible and if you 're wearing clothing you 've taken off your clothing you 're going to get showered down some place and remove the radiation that would be -- the radioactive material that might be on you and then you want to stay in shelter for 48 to 72 hours minimum but you 're going to wait hopefully -- you 'll have your little wind-up battery-less radio and you 'll be waiting for people to tell you when it 's safe to go outside that 's what you need to do in conclusion nuclear war is less likely than before but by no means out of the question and it 's not survivable nuclear terrorism is possible -- it may be probable -- but is survivable and this is jack geiger who 's one of the heroes of the u.s. public health community and jack said the only way to deal with nuclear anything whether it 's war or terrorism is abolition of nuclear weapons and you want something to work on once you 've fixed global warming i urge you to think about the fact that we have to do something about this unacceptable inhumane reality of nuclear weapons in our world now this is my favorite civil defense slide and i -- -- i do n't want to be indelicate but this -- he 's no longer in office we do n't really care ok this was sent to me by somebody who is an aficionado of civil defense procedures but the fact of the matter is that america 's gone through a very hard time we 've not been focused we 've not done what we had to do and now we 're facing the potential of bad hell on earth thank you so i really consider myself a storyteller but i do n't really tell stories in the usual way in the sense that i do n't usually tell my own stories instead i 'm really interested in building tools that allow large numbers of other people to tell their stories people all around the world i do this because i think that people actually have a lot in common i think people are very similar but i also think that we have trouble seeing that you know as i look around the world i see a lot of gaps and i think we all see a lot of gaps and we define ourselves by our gaps there 's language gaps there 's ethnicity and racial gaps there 's age gaps there 's gender gaps there 's sexuality gaps there 's wealth and money gaps there 's education gaps there 's also religious gaps you know we have all these gaps and i think we like our gaps because they make us feel like we identify with something some smaller community but i think that actually despite our gaps we really have a lot in common and i think one thing we have in common is a very deep need to express ourselves i think this is a very old human desire it 's nothing new but the thing about self-expression is that there 's traditionally been this imbalance between the desire that we have to express ourselves and the number of sympathetic friends who are willing to stand around and listen this also is nothing new since the dawn of human history we 've tried to rectify this imbalance by making art writing poems singing songs scripting editorials and sending them in to a newspaper gossiping with friends this is nothing new what 's new is that in the last several years a lot of these very traditional physical human activities these acts of self-expression have been moving onto the internet and as that 's happened people have been leaving behind footprints footprints that tell stories of their moments of self-expression and so what i do is i write computer programs that study very large sets of these footprints and then try to draw conclusions about the people who left them -- what they feel what they think what 's different in the world today than usual these sorts of questions one project that explores these ideas which was made about a year ago is a piece called we feel fine this is a piece that every two or three minutes scans the world 's newly-posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases " i feel " or " i am feeling " and when it finds one of those phrases it grabs the sentence up to the period and then automatically tries to deduce the age gender and geographical location of the person that wrote that sentence then knowing the geographical location and the time we can also then figure out the weather when that person wrote the sentence all of this information is saved in a database that collects about 20,000 feelings a day it 's been running for about a year and a half it 's reached about seven-and-a-half million human feelings now and i 'll show you a glimpse of how this information is then visualized so this is we feel fine what you see here is a madly swarming mass of particles each of which represents a single human feeling that was stated in the last few hours the color of each particle corresponds to the type of feeling inside -- so that happy positive feelings are brightly colored and sad negative feelings are darkly colored the diameter of each dot represents the length of the sentence inside so that the large dots contain large sentences and the small dots contain small sentences any dot can be clicked and expanded and we see here " i would just feel so much better if i could curl up in his arms right now and feel his affection for me in the embrace of his body and the tenderness of his lips " so it gets pretty hot and steamy sometimes in the world of human emotions and all of these are stated by people : " i know that objectively it really does n't mean much but after spending so many years as a small fish in a big pond it 's nice to feel bigger again " the dots exhibit human qualities they kind of have their own physics and they swarm wildly around kind of exploring the world of life and then they also exhibit curiosity you can see a few of them are swarming around the cursor right now you can see some other ones are swarming around the bottom left corner of the screen around six words those six words represent the six movements of we feel fine we 're currently seeing madness there 's also murmurs montage mobs metrics and mounds and i 'll walk you through a few of those now murmurs causes all of the feelings to fly to the ceiling and then one by one in reverse chronological order they excuse themselves entering the scrolling list of feelings " i feel a bit better now " " i feel confused and unsure of what the hell i want to do " " i feel gypped out of something awesome here " " i feel so free ; i feel so good " " i feel like i 'm in this fog of depression that i ca n't get out of " and you can click any of these to go out and visit the blog from which it was collected and in that way you can connect with the authors of these statements if you feel some degree of empathy the next movement is called montage montage causes all of the feelings that contain photographs to become extracted and display themselves in a grid this grid is then said to represent the picture of the world 's feelings in the last few hours if you will each of these can be clicked and we can blow it up we see " i just feel like i 'm not going to have fun if it 's not the both of us " that was from someone in michigan we see " i feel like i have been at a computer all day " these are automatically constructed using the found objects : " i think i feel a little full " the next movement is called mobs mobs provides different statistical breakdowns of the population of the world 's feelings in the last few hours we see that " better " is the most frequent feeling right now followed by " good " " bad " " guilty " " right " " down " " sick " and so on we can also get a gender breakdown and we see that women are slightly more prolific talking about their emotions in the last few hours than men we can do an age breakdown which gives us a histogram of the world 's emotional distribution by age we see people in their twenties are the most prolific followed by teenagers and then people in their thirties and it dies out very quickly from there in weather the feelings assume the physical characteristics of the weather that they represent so that the ones collected on a sunny day swirl around as if they 're part of the sun the cloudy ones float along as if they 're on a breeze the rainy ones fall down as if they 're in a rainstorm and the snowy ones kind of flutter to the ground finally location causes the feelings to move to their positions on a world map showing the geographical distribution of feelings metrics provides more numerical views on the data we see that the world is feeling " used " at 3.3 times the normal level right now they 're feeling " warm " at 2.9 times the normal level and so on other views are also available here are gender age weather location the final movement is called mounds it 's a bit different from the others mounds visualizes the entire dataset as large gelatinous blobs which kind of jiggle and if i hold down my cursor they do a little dance we see " better " is the most frequent feeling followed by " bad " and then if i go over here the list begins to scroll and there are actually thousands of feelings that have been collected you can see the little pink cursor moving along representing our position here we see people that feel " slipping " " nauseous " " responsible " there 's also a search capability if you 're interested in finding out about a certain population for instance you could find women who feel " addicted " in their 20s when it was cloudy in bangladesh but i 'll spare you that so here are some of my favorite montages that have been collected : " i feel so much of my dad alive in me that there is n't even room for me " " i feel very lonely " " i need to be in some backwoods redneck town so that i can feel beautiful " " i feel invisible to you " " i would n't hide it if society did n't make me feel like i needed to " " i feel in love with carolyn " " i feel so naughty " " i feel these weirdoes are actually an asset to college life " " i love how i feel today " so as you can see we feel fine uses a technique that i call " passive observation " what i mean by that is that it passively observes people as they live their lives it scans the world 's blogs and looks at what people are writing and these people do n't know they 're being watched or interviewed and because of that you end up getting very honest candid sincere responses that are often very moving and this is a technique that i usually prefer in my work because people do n't know they 're being interviewed they 're just living life and they end up just acting like that another technique is directly questioning people and this is a technique that i explored in a different project the yahoo ! time capsule which was designed to take a fingerprint of the world in 2006 it was divided into ten very simple themes -- love anger sadness and so on -- each of which contained a single very open-ended question put to the world : what do you love what makes you angry what makes you sad what do you believe in and so on the time capsule was available for one month online translated into 10 languages and this is what it looked like it 's a spinning globe the surface of which is entirely composed of the pictures and words and drawings of people that submitted to the time capsule the ten themes radiate out and orbit the time capsule you can sift through this data and see what people have submitted this is in response to what 's beautiful " miss world " there are two modes to the time capsule there 's one world which presents the spinning globe and many voices which splits the data out into film strips and lets you sift through them one by one so this project was punctuated by a really amazing event which was held in the desert outside albuquerque in new mexico at the jemez pueblo where for three consecutive nights the contents of the capsule were projected onto the sides of the ancient red rock canyon walls which stand about 200 feet tall it was really incredible and we also projected the contents of the time capsule as binary code using a 35-watt laser into outer space you can see the orange line leaving the desert floor at about a 45 degree angle there this was amazing because the first night i looked at all this information and really started seeing the gaps that i talked about earlier -- the differences in age gender and wealth and so on but you know as i looked at this more and more and more and saw these images go across the rocks i realized i was seeing the same archetypal events depicted again and again and again you know : weddings births funerals the first car the first kiss the first camel or horse -- depending on the culture and it was really moving and this picture here was taken the final night from a distant cliff about two miles away where the contents of the capsule were being beamed into space and there was something very moving about all of this human expression being shot off into the night sky and it started to make me think a lot about the night sky and how humans have always used the night sky to project their great stories you know as a child in vermont on a farm where i grew up i would often look up into the dark sky and see the three star belt of orion the hunter and as an adult i 've been more aware of the great greek myths playing out in the sky overhead every night you know orion facing the roaring bull perseus flying to the rescue of andromeda zeus battling chronos for control of mount olympus i mean these are the great tales of the greeks and it caused me to wonder about our world today and it caused me to wonder specifically if we could make new constellations today what would those look like what would those be if we could make new pictures in the sky what would we draw what are the great stories of today and those are the questions that inspired my new project which is debuting here today at ted nobody 's seen this yet publicly it 's called universe : revealing our modern mythology and it uses this metaphor of an interactive night sky so it 's my great pleasure now to show this to you so universe will open here and you 'll see that it leads with a shifting star field and there 's an aurora borealis in the background kind of morphing with color the color of the aurora borealis can be controlled using this single bar of color at the bottom and we 'll put it down here to red so you see this kind of -- these stars moving along now these are n't just little points of light little pixels each of those stars actually represents a specific event in the real world -- a quote that was stated by somebody an image a news story a person a company you know some kind of heroic personality and you might notice that as the cursor begins to touch some of these stars that shapes begin to emerge we see here there 's a little man walking along or maybe a woman and we see here a photograph with a head you can start to see words emerging here and those are the constellations of today and i can turn them all on and you can see them moving across the sky now this is the universe of 2007 the last two months the data from this is global news coverage from thousands of news sources around the world it 's using the api of a really great company that i work with in new york actually called daylife and it 's kind of the zeitgeist view at this level of the world 's current mythology over the last couple of months so we can see where it 's emerging here like president ford iraq bush and we can actually isolate just the words -- i call them secrets -- and we can cause them to form an alphabetical list and we see anna nicole smith playing a big role recently president ford -- this is gerald ford 's funeral we can actually click anything in universe and have it become the center of the universe and everything else will enter its orbit so we 'll click ford and now that becomes the center and the things that relate to ford enter its orbit and swirl around it we can isolate just the photographs and we now see those we can click on one of those and have the photograph be the center of the universe now the things that relate to it are swirling around we can click on this and we see this iconic image of betty ford kissing her husband 's coffin in universe there 's kind of no end it just goes infinitely and you can just kind of click on stuff this is a photographic representation called snapshots but we can actually be more specific in defining our universe so if we want to let 's check out what bill clinton 's universe looks like and let 's see in the past week what he 's been up to so now we have a new universe which is just constrained to all things bill clinton we can have his constellations emerge here we can pull out his secrets and we see that it has a lot to do with candidates hillary presidential barack obama we can see the stories that bill clinton is taking part in right now any of those can be opened up so we see obama and the clintons meet in alabama you can see that this is an important story ; there are a lot of things in its orbit if we open this up we get different perspectives on this story you can click any of those to go out and read the article at the source this one 's from al jazeera we can also see the superstars these would be the people that are kind of the looming heroes and heroines in the universe of bill clinton so there 's bill clinton hillary iraq george bush barack obama scooter libby -- these are kind of the people of bill clinton we can also see a world map so this shows us the geographic reach of bill clinton in the last week or so we can see he 's been focused in america because he 's been campaigning probably but a little bit of action over here in the middle east and then we can also see a timeline so we see that he was a bit quiet on saturday but he was back to work on sunday morning and actually been tapering off since then this week and it 's not limited to just people or dates but we can actually put in concepts also so if i put in climate change for all of 2006 we 'll see what that universe looks like here we have our star field here we have our shapes here we have our secrets so we see again climate change is large : nairobi global conference environmental and there are also quotes that you can see if you 're interested in reading about quotes on climate change you know this is really an infinite thing the superstars of climate change in 2006 : united states britain china you know these are the towering countries that kind of define this concept so this is a piece that demands exploration this will be online in several days probably next tuesday and you 'll all be able to use it and kind of explore what your own personal mythology might be you 'll notice that in daylife -- rather in universe -- it supports both the notion of a global mythology which is represented by something as broad as say 2007 and also a personal mythology as you search for the things that are important to you in your world and then see what the constellations of those might look like so it 's been a pleasure thank you very much i became an inventor by accident i was out of the air force in 1956 no no that 's not true : i went in in 1956 came out in 1959 was working at the university of washington and i came up with an idea from reading a magazine article for a new kind of a phonograph tone arm now that was before cassette tapes c.d.s dvds -- any of the cool stuff we 've got now and it was an arm that instead of hinging and pivoting as it went across the record went straight : a radial linear tracking tone arm and it was the hardest invention i ever made but it got me started and i got really lucky after that and without giving you too much of a tirade i want to talk to you about an invention i brought with me today : my 44th invention no that 's not true either golly i 'm just totally losing it my 44th patent ; about the 15th invention i call this hypersonic sound i 'm going to play it for you in a couple minutes but i want to make an analogy before i do to this i usually show this hypersonic sound and people will say that 's really cool but what 's it good for and i say what is the light bulb good for sound light : i 'm going to draw the analogy when edison invented the light bulb pretty much looked like this has n't changed that much light came out of it in every direction before the light bulb was invented people had figured out how to put a reflector behind it focus it a little bit ; put lenses in front of it focus it a little bit better ultimately we figured out how to make things like lasers that were totally focused now think about where the world would be today if we had the light bulb but you could n't focus light ; if when you turned one on it just went wherever it wanted to that 's the way loudspeakers pretty much are you turn on the loudspeaker and after almost 80 years of having those gadgets the sound just kind of goes where it wants even when you 're standing in front of a megaphone it 's pretty much every direction a little bit of differential but not much if the light bulb was the way the speaker is and you could n't focus or sharpen the edges or define it we would n't have that or movies in general or computers or t.v sets or c.d.s or dvds -- and just go down the list of what the importance is of being able to focus light now after almost 80 years of having sound i thought it was about time that we figure out a way to put sound where you want to i have a couple of units that guy there was made for a demo i did yesterday early in the day for a big car maker in detroit who wants to put them in a car -- small version over your head -- so that you can actually get binaural sound in a car what if i could aim sound the way i aim light i got this waterfall i recorded in my back yard now you 're not going to hear a thing unless it hits you maybe if i hit the side wall it will bounce around the room the sound is being made right next to your ears is that cool because i have some limited time i 'll cut it off for a second and tell you about how it works and what it 's good for course like light it 's great to be able to put sound to highlight a clothing rack or the cornflakes or the toothpaste or a talking plaque in a movie theater lobby sony 's got an idea -- sony 's our biggest customers right now they tried this back in the '60s and were too smart and so they gave up but they want to use it -- seriously there 's a mix an inventor has to have you have to be kind of smart and though i did not graduate from college does n't mean i 'm stupid because you can not be stupid and do very much in the world today too many other smart people out there so i just happened to get my education in a little different way i 'm not at all against education i think it 's wonderful ; i think sometimes people when they get educated lose it : they get so smart they 're unwilling to look at things that they know better than and we 're living in a great time right now because almost everything 's being explored anew i have this little slogan that i use a lot which is : virtually nothing -- and i mean this honestly -- has been invented yet we 're just starting we 're just starting to really discover the laws of nature and science and physics and this is i hope a little piece of it sony 's got this vision back -- to get myself on track -- that when you stand in the checkout line in the supermarket you 're going to watch a new t.v channel they know that when you watch t.v at home because there are so many choices you can change channels miss their commercials a hundred and fifty-one million people every day stand in the line at the supermarket now they 've tried this a couple years ago and it failed because the checker gets tired of hearing the same message every 20 minutes and reaches out turns off the sound and you know if the sound is n't there the sale typically is n't made for instance like when you 're on an airplane they show the movie you get to watch it for free ; when you want to hear the sound you pay and so abc and sony have devised this new thing where when you step in the line in the supermarket -- initially it 'll be safeways it is safeways ; they 're trying this in three parts of the country right now -- you 'll be watching tv and hopefully they 'll be sensitive that they do n't want to offend you with just one more outlet but what 's great about it from the tests that have been done is if you do n't want to hear it you take about one step to the side and you do n't hear it so we create silence as much as we create sound atms that talk to you ; nobody else hears it sit in bed two in the morning watch tv ; your spouse or someone is next to you asleep ; does n't hear it does n't wake up we 're also working on noise canceling things like snoring noise from automobiles i have been really lucky with this technology : all of a sudden as it is ready the world is ready to accept it they have literally beat a path to our door we 've been selling it since about last september october and it 's been immensely gratifying if you 're interested in what it costs -- i 'm not selling them today -- but this unit with the electronics and everything if you buy one is around a thousand bucks we expect by this time next year it 'll be hundreds a few hundred bucks to buy it it 's not any more pricey than regular electronics now when i played it for you you did n't hear the thunderous bass this unit that i played goes from about 200 hertz to above the range of hearing it 's actually emitting ultrasound -- low-level ultrasound -- that 's about 100,000 vibrations per second and the sound that you 're hearing unlike a regular speaker on which all the sound is made on the face is made out in front of it in the air the air is not linear as we 've always been taught you turn up the volume just a little bit -- i 'm talking about a little over 80 decibels -- and all of a sudden the air begins to corrupt signals you propagate here 's why : the speed of sound is not a constant it 's fairly slow it changes with temperature and with barometric pressure now imagine if you will without getting too technical i 'm making a little sine wave here in the air well if i turn up the amplitude too much i 'm having an effect on the pressure which means during the making of that sine wave the speed at which it is propagating is shifting all of audio as we know it is an attempt to be more and more perfectly linear linearity means higher quality sound hypersonic sound is exactly the opposite : it 's 100 percent based on non-linearity an effect happens in the air it 's a corrupting effect of the sound -- the ultrasound in this case -- that 's emitted but it 's so predictable that you can produce very precise audio out of that effect now the question is where 's the sound made instead of being made on the face of the cone it 's made at literally billions of little independent points along this narrow column in the air and so when i aim it towards you what you hear is made right next to your ears i said we can shorten the column we can spread it out to cover the couch i can put it so that one ear hears one speaker the other ear hears the other that 's true binaural sound when you listen to stereo on your home system your both ears hear both speakers turn on the left speaker sometime and notice you 're hearing it also in your right ear so the stage is more restricted -- the sound stage that 's supposed to spread out in front of you because the sound is made in the air along this column it does not follow the inverse square law which says it drops off about two thirds every time you double the distance : 6db every time you go from one meter for instance to two meters that means you go to a rock concert or a symphony and the guy in the front row gets the same level as the guy in the back row now all of a sudden is n't that terrific so we 've been as i say very successful very lucky in having companies catch the vision of this from cars -- car makers who want to put a stereo system in the front for the kids and a separate system in the back -- oh no the kids are n't driving today i was seeing if you were listening actually i have n't had breakfast yet a stereo system in the front for mom and dad and maybe there 's a little dvd player in the back for the kids and the parents do n't want to be bothered with that or their rap music or whatever so again this idea of being able to put sound anywhere you want to is really starting to catch on it also works for transmitting and communicating data it also works five times better underwater we 've got the military -- have just deployed some of these into iraq where you can put fake troop movements quarter of a mile away on a hillside or you can whisper in the ear of a supposed terrorist some biblical verse i 'm serious and they have these infrared devices that can look at their countenance and see a fraction of a degree kelvin in temperature shift from 100 yards away when they play this thing and so another way of hopefully determining who 's friendly and who is n't we make a version with this which puts out 155 decibels pain is 120 so it allows you to go nearly a mile away and communicate with people and there can be a public beach just off to the side and they do n't even know it 's turned on we sell those to the military presently for about 70,000 dollars and they 're buying them as fast as we can make them we put it on a turret with a camera so that when they shoot at you you 're over there and it 's there i have a bunch of other inventions i invented a plasma antenna to shift gears looked up at the ceiling of my office one day -- i was working on a ground-penetrating radar project -- and my physicist ceo came in and said " we have a real problem we 're using very short wavelengths we 've got a problem with the antenna ringing when you run very short wavelengths like a tuning fork the antenna resonates and there 's more energy coming out of the antenna than there is the backscatter from the ground that we 're trying to analyze taking too much processing " i says " why do n't we make an antenna that only exists when you want it turn it on ; turn it off that 's a fluorescent tube refined " i just sold that for a million and a half dollars cash i took it back to the pentagon after it got declassified when the patent issued and told the people back there about it and they laughed and then i took them back a demo and they bought any of you ever wore a jabber headphone -- the little cell headphones that 's my invention i sold that for seven million dollars big mistake : it just sold for 80 million dollars two years ago i actually drew that up on a little crummy mac computer in my attic at my house and one of the many designs which they have now is still the same design i drew way back when so i 've been really lucky as an inventor i 'm the happiest guy you 're ever going to meet and my dad died before he realized anybody in the family would maybe hopefully make something out of themselves you 've been a great audience i know i 've jumped all over the place i usually figure out what my talk is when i get up in front of a group let me give you in the last minute one more quick demo of this guy for those of you that have n't heard it can never tell if it 's on if you have n't heard it raise your hand getting it over there get the cameraman yeah there you go i 've got a coke can opening that 's right in your head ; that 's really cool thank you once again appreciate it very much i live and work from tokyo japan and i specialize in human behavioral research and applying what we learn to think about the future in different ways and to design for that future and you know to be honest i 've been doing this for seven years and i have n't got a clue what the future is going to be like but i 've got a pretty good idea how people will behave when they get there this is my office it 's out there it 's not in the lab and it 's increasingly in places like india china brazil africa we live on a planet -- 6.3 billion people about three billion people by the end of this year will have cellular connectivity and it 'll take about another two years to connect the next billion after that and i mention this because if we want to design for that future we need to figure out what those people are about and that 's kind of where i see what my job is and what our team 's job is our research often starts with a very simple question so i 'll give you an example what do you carry if you think of everything in your life that you own when you walk out that door what do you consider to take with you when you 're looking around what do you consider of that stuff what do you carry and of that stuff what do you actually use so this is interesting to us because the conscious and subconscious decision process implies that the stuff that you do take with you and end up using has some kind of spiritual emotional or functional value and to put it really bluntly you know people are willing to pay for stuff that has value right so i 've probably done about five years ' research looking at what people carry i go in people 's bags i look in people 's pockets purses i go in their homes and we do this worldwide and we follow them around town with video cameras it 's kind of like stalking with permission and we do all this -- and to go back to the original question what do people carry and it turns out that people carry a lot of stuff ok that 's fair enough but if you ask people what the three most important things that they carry are -- across cultures and across gender and across contexts -- most people will say keys money and if they own one a mobile phone and i 'm not saying this is a good thing but this is a thing right i mean i could n't take your phones off you if i wanted to you 'd probably kick me out or something ok it might seem like an obvious thing for someone who works for a mobile phone company to ask but really the question is why right so why are these things so important in our lives and it turns out from our research that it boils down to survival -- survival for us and survival for our loved ones so keys provide an access to shelter and warmth -- transport as well in the u.s. increasingly money is useful for buying food sustenance among all its other uses and a mobile phone it turns out is a great recovery tool if you prefer this kind of maslow 's hierarchy of needs those three objects are very good at supporting the lowest rungs in maslow 's hierarchy of needs yes they do a whole bunch of other stuff but they 're very good at this and in particular it 's the mobile phone 's ability to allow people to transcend space and time and what i mean by that is you know you can transcend space by simply making a voice call right and you can transcend time by sending a message at your convenience and someone else can pick it up at their convenience and this is fairly universally appreciated it turns out which is why we have three billion plus people who have been connected and they value that connectivity but actually you can do this kind of stuff with pcs and you can do them with phone kiosks and the mobile phone in addition is both personal -- and so it also gives you a degree of privacy -- and it 's convenient you do n't need to ask permission from anyone you can just go ahead and do it right however for these things to help us survive it depends on them being carried but -- and it 's a pretty big but -- we forget we 're human that 's what we do it 's one of our features i think quite a nice feature so we forget but we 're also adaptable and we adapt to situations around us pretty well and so we have these strategies to remember and one of them was mentioned yesterday and it 's quite simply the point of reflection and that 's that moment when you 're walking out of a space and you turn around and quite often you tap your pockets even women who keep stuff in their bags tap their pockets and you turn around and you look back into the space and some people talk aloud and pretty much everyone does it at some point ok the next thing is -- most of you if you have a stable home life and what i mean is that you do n't travel all the time and always in hotels but most people have what we call a center of gravity and a center of gravity is where you keep these objects and these things do n't stay in the center of gravity but over time they gravitate there it 's where you expect to find stuff and in fact when you 're turning around and you 're looking inside the house and you 're looking for this stuff this is where you look first right ok so when we did this research we found the absolutely 100 percent guaranteed way to never forget anything ever ever again and that is quite simply to have nothing to remember ok now that sounds like something you get on a chinese fortune cookie right but is in fact about the art of delegation and from a design perspective it 's about understanding what you can delegate to technology and what you can delegate to other people and it turns out delegation -- if you want it to be -- can be the solution for pretty much everything apart from things like bodily functions going to the toilet you ca n't ask someone to do that on your behalf and apart from things like entertainment you would n't pay for someone to go to the cinema for you and have fun on your behalf or at least not yet maybe sometime in the future we will so let me give you an example of delegation in practice right so this is -- probably the thing i 'm most passionate about is the research that we 've been doing on illiteracy and how people who are illiterate communicate so the u.n. estimated -- this is 2004 figures -- that there are almost 800 million people who ca n't read and write worldwide so we 've been conducting a lot of research and one of the things we were looking at is -- if you ca n't read and write if you want to communicate over distances you need to be able to identify the person that you want to communicate with it could be a phone number it could be an e-mail address it could be a postal address simple question : if you ca n't read and write how do you manage your contact information and the fact is that millions of people do it just from a design perspective we did n't really understand how they did it and so that 's just one small example of the kind of research that we were doing and it turns out that illiterate people are masters of delegation so they delegate that part of the task process to other people the stuff that they ca n't do themselves let me give you another example of delegation this one 's a little bit more sophisticated and this is from a study that we did in uganda about how people who are sharing devices use those devices sente is a word in uganda that means money it has a second meaning which is to send money as airtime ok and it works like this so let 's say june you 're in a village rural village i 'm in kampala and i 'm the wage earner i 'm sending money back and it works like this so in your village there 's one person in the village with a phone and that 's the phone kiosk operator and it 's quite likely that they 'd have a quite simple mobile phone as a phone kiosk so what i do is i buy a prepaid card like this and instead of using that money to top up my own phone i call up the local village operator and i read out that number to them and they use it to top up their phone so they 're topping up the value from kampala and it 's now being topped up in the village you take a 10 or 20 percent commission and then you -- the kiosk operator takes 10 or 20 percent commission and passes the rest over to you in cash ok there 's two things i like about this so the first is it turns anyone who has access to a mobile phone -- anyone who has a mobile phone -- essentially into an atm machine it brings rudimentary banking services to places where there 's no banking infrastructure and even if they could have access to the banking infrastructure they would n't necessarily be considered viable customers because they 're not wealthy enough to have bank accounts there 's a second thing i like about this and that is that despite all the resources at my disposal and despite all our kind of apparent sophistication i know i could never have designed something as elegant and as totally in tune with the local conditions as this ok and yes there are things like grameen bank and micro-lending but the difference between this and that is there 's no central authority trying to control this this is just street-up innovation so it turns out the street is a never-ending source of inspiration for us and ok if you break one of these things here you return it to the carrier they 'll give you a new one they 'll probably give you three new ones right i mean that 's buy three get one free that kind of thing if you go on the streets of india and china you see this kind of stuff and this is where they take the stuff that breaks and they fix it and they put it back into circulation this is from a workbench in jilin city in china and you can see people taking down a phone and putting it back together they reverse-engineer manuals this is a kind of hacker 's manual and it 's written in chinese and english they also write them in hindi you can subscribe to these there are training institutes where they 're churning out people for fixing these things as well but what i like about this is it boils down to someone on the street with a small flat surface a screwdriver a toothbrush for cleaning the contact heads -- because they often get dust on the contact heads -- and knowledge and it 's all about the social network of the knowledge floating around and i like this because it challenges the way that we design stuff and build stuff and potentially distribute stuff it challenges the norms ok for me the street just raises so many different questions like this is viagra that i bought from a backstreet sex shop in china and china is a country where you get a lot of fakes and i know what you 're asking -- did i test it i 'm not going to answer that ok but i look at something like this and i consider the implications of trust and confidence in the purchase process and we look at this and we think well how does that apply for example for the design of -- the lessons from this -- apply to the design of online services future services in these markets this is a pair of underpants from -- -- from tibet and i look at something like this and honestly you know why would someone design underpants with a pocket right and i look at something like this and it makes me question if we were to take all the functionality in things like this and redistribute them around the body in some kind of personal area network how would we prioritize where to put stuff and yes this is quite trivial but actually the lessons from this can apply to that kind of personal area networks and what you see here is a couple of phone numbers written above the shack in rural uganda this does n't have house numbers this has phone numbers so what does it mean when people 's identity is mobile when those extra three billion people 's identity is mobile it is n't fixed your notion of identity is out-of-date already ok for those extra three billion people this is how it 's shifting and then i go to this picture here which is the one that i started with and this is from delhi it 's from a study we did into illiteracy and it 's a guy in a teashop you can see the chai being poured in the background and he 's a you know incredibly poor teashop worker on the lowest rungs in the society and he somehow has the appreciation of the values of livestrong and it 's not necessarily the same values but some kind of values of livestrong to actually go out and purchase them and actually display them for me this kind of personifies this connected world where everything is intertwined and the dots are -- it 's all about the dots joining together ok the title of this presentation is " connections and consequences " and it 's really a kind of summary of five years of trying to figure out what it 's going to be like when everyone on the planet has the ability to transcend space and time in a personal and convenient manner right when everyone 's connected and there are four things so the first thing is the immediacy of ideas the speed at which ideas go around and i know ted is about big ideas but actually the benchmark for a big idea is changing if you want a big idea you need to embrace everyone on the planet that 's the first thing the second thing is the immediacy of objects and what i mean by that is as these become smaller as the functionality that you can access through this becomes greater -- things like banking identity -- these things quite simply move very quickly around the world and so the speed of the adoption of things is just going to become that much more rapid in a way that we just totally can not conceive when you get it to 6.3 billion and the growth in the world 's population the next thing is that however we design this stuff -- carefully design this stuff -- the street will take it and will figure out ways to innovate as long as it meets base needs -- the ability to transcend space and time for example and it will innovate in ways that we can not anticipate in ways that despite our resources they can do it better than us that 's my feeling and if we 're smart we 'll look at this stuff that 's going on and we 'll figure out a way to enable it to inform and infuse both what we design and how we design and the last thing is that -- actually the direction of the conversation with another three billion people connected they want to be part of the conversation and i think our relevance and ted 's relevance is really about embracing that and learning how to listen essentially and we need to learn how to listen so thank you very very much on the 30th of may 1832 a gunshot was heard ringing out across the 13th arrondissement in paris a peasant who was walking to market that morning ran towards where the gunshot had come from and found a young man writhing in agony on the floor clearly shot by a dueling wound the young man 's name was evariste galois he was a well-known revolutionary in paris at the time galois was taken to the local hospital where he died the next day in the arms of his brother and the last words he said to his brother were " do n't cry for me alfred i need all the courage i can muster to die at the age of 20 " it was n't in fact revolutionary politics for which galois was famous but a few years earlier while still at school he 'd actually cracked one of the big mathematical problems at the time and he wrote to the academicians in paris trying to explain his theory but the academicians could n't understand anything that he wrote this is how he wrote most of his mathematics so the night before that duel he realized this possibly is his last chance to try and explain his great breakthrough so he stayed up the whole night writing away trying to explain his ideas and as the dawn came up and he went to meet his destiny he left this pile of papers on the table for the next generation maybe the fact that he stayed up all night doing mathematics was the fact that he was such a bad shot that morning and got killed but contained inside those documents was a new language a language to understand one of the most fundamental concepts of science -- namely symmetry now symmetry is almost nature 's language it helps us to understand so many different bits of the scientific world for example molecular structure what crystals are possible we can understand through the mathematics of symmetry in microbiology you really do n't want to get a symmetrical object because they are generally rather nasty the swine flu virus at the moment is a symmetrical object and it uses the efficiency of symmetry to be able to propagate itself so well but on a larger scale of biology actually symmetry is very important because it actually communicates genetic information i 've taken two pictures here and i 've made them artificially symmetrical and if i ask you which of these you find more beautiful you 're probably drawn to the lower two because it is hard to make symmetry and if you can make yourself symmetrical you 're sending out a sign that you 've got good genes you 've got a good upbringing and therefore you 'll make a good mate so symmetry is a language which can help to communicate genetic information symmetry can also help us to explain what 's happening in the large hadron collider in cern or what 's not happening in the large hadron collider in cern to be able to make predictions about the fundamental particles we might see there it seems that they are all facets of some strange symmetrical shape in a higher dimensional space and i think galileo summed up very nicely the power of mathematics to understand the scientific world around us he wrote " the universe can not be read until we have learnt the language and become familiar with the characters in which it is written it is written in mathematical language and the letters are triangles circles and other geometric figures without which means it is humanly impossible to comprehend a single word " but it 's not just scientists who are interested in symmetry artists too love to play around with symmetry they also have a slightly more ambiguous relationship with it here is thomas mann talking about symmetry in " the magic mountain " he has a character describing the snowflake and he says he " shuddered at its perfect precision found it deathly the very marrow of death " but what artists like to do is to set up expectations of symmetry and then break them and a beautiful example of this i found actually when i visited a colleague of mine in japan professor kurokawa and he took me up to the temples in nikko and just after this photo was taken we walked up the stairs and the gateway you see behind has eight columns with beautiful symmetrical designs on them seven of them are exactly the same and the eighth one is turned upside down and i said to professor kurokawa " wow the architects must have really been kicking themselves when they realized that they 'd made a mistake and put this one upside down " and he said " no no no it was a very deliberate act " and he referred me to this lovely quote from the japanese " essays in idleness " from the 14th century in which the essayist wrote " in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth " even when building the imperial palace they always leave one place unfinished but if i had to choose one building in the world to be cast out on a desert island to live the rest of my life being an addict of symmetry i would probably choose the alhambra in granada this is a palace celebrating symmetry recently i took my family -- we do these rather kind of nerdy mathematical trips which my family love this is my son tamer you can see he 's really enjoying our mathematical trip to the alhambra but i wanted to try and enrich him i think one of the problems about school mathematics is it does n't look at how mathematics is embedded in the world we live in so i wanted to open his eyes up to how much symmetry is running through the alhambra you see it already immediately you go in the reflective symmetry in the water but it 's on the walls where all the exciting things are happening the moorish artists were denied the possibility to draw things with souls so they explored a more geometric art and so what is symmetry the alhambra somehow asks all of these questions what is symmetry when [ there ] are two of these walls do they have the same symmetries can we say whether they discovered all of the symmetries in the alhambra and it was galois who produced a language to be able to answer some of these questions for galois symmetry -- unlike for thomas mann which was something still and deathly -- for galois symmetry was all about motion what can you do to a symmetrical object move it in some way so it looks the same as before you moved it i like to describe it as the magic trick moves what can you do to something you close your eyes i do something put it back down again it looks like it did before it started so for example the walls in the alhambra -- i can take all of these tiles and fix them at the yellow place rotate them by 90 degrees put them all back down again and they fit perfectly down there and if you open your eyes again you would n't know that they 'd moved but it 's the motion that really characterizes the symmetry inside the alhambra but it 's also about producing a language to describe this and the power of mathematics is often to change one thing into another to change geometry into language so i 'm going to take you through perhaps push you a little bit mathematically -- so brace yourselves -- push you a little bit to understand how this language works which enables us to capture what is symmetry so let 's take these two symmetrical objects here let 's take the twisted six-pointed starfish what can i do to the starfish which makes it look the same well there i rotated it by a sixth of a turn and still it looks like it did before i started i could rotate it by a third of a turn or a half a turn or put it back down on its image or two thirds of a turn and a fifth symmetry i can rotate it by five sixths of a turn and those are things that i can do to the symmetrical object that make it look like it did before i started now for galois there was actually a sixth symmetry can anybody think what else i could do to this which would leave it like i did before i started i ca n't flip it because i 've put a little twist on it have n't i it 's got no reflective symmetry but what i could do is just leave it where it is pick it up and put it down again and for galois this was like the zeroth symmetry actually the invention of the number zero was a very modern concept seventh century a.d. by the indians it seems mad to talk about nothing and this is the same idea this is a symmetrical -- so everything has symmetry where you just leave it where it is so this object has six symmetries and what about the triangle well i can rotate by a third of a turn clockwise or a third of a turn anticlockwise but now this has some reflectional symmetry i can reflect it in the line through x or the line through y or the line through z five symmetries and then of course the zeroth symmetry where i just pick it up and leave it where it is so both of these objects have six symmetries now i 'm a great believer that mathematics is not a spectator sport and you have to do some mathematics in order to really understand it so here is a little question for you and i 'm going to give a prize at the end of my talk for the person who gets closest to the answer the rubik 's cube how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have how many things can i do to this object and put it down so it still looks like a cube okay so i want you to think about that problem as we go on and count how many symmetries there are and there will be a prize for the person who gets closest at the end but let 's go back down to symmetries that i got for these two objects what galois realized : it is n't just the individual symmetries but how they interact with each other which really characterizes the symmetry of an object if i do one magic trick move followed by another the combination is a third magic trick move and here we see galois starting to develop a language to see the substance of the things unseen the sort of abstract idea of the symmetry underlying this physical object for example what if i turn the starfish by a sixth of a turn and then a third of a turn so i 've given names the capital letters a b c d e f are the names for the rotations b for example rotates the little yellow dot to the b on the starfish and so on so what if i do b which is a sixth of a turn followed by c which is a third of a turn well let 's do that a sixth of a turn followed by a third of a turn the combined effect is as if i had just rotated it by half a turn in one go so the little table here records how the algebra of these symmetries work i do one followed by another the answer is it 's rotation d half a turn what i if i did it in the other order would it make any difference let 's see let 's do the third of the turn first and then the sixth of a turn of course it does n't make any difference it still ends up at half a turn and there is some symmetry here in the way the symmetries interact with each other but this is completely different to the symmetries of the triangle let 's see what happens if we do two symmetries with the triangle one after the other let 's do a rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise and reflect in the line through x well the combined effect is as if i had just done the reflection in the line through z to start with now let 's do it in a different order let 's do the reflection in x first followed by the rotation by a third of a turn anticlockwise the combined effect the triangle ends up somewhere completely different it 's as if it was reflected in the line through y now it matters what order you do the operations in and this enables us to distinguish why the symmetries of these objects -- they both have six symmetries so why should n't we say they have the same symmetries but the way the symmetries interact enable us -- we 've now got a language to distinguish why these symmetries are fundamentally different and you can try this when you go down to the pub later on take a beer mat and rotate it by a quarter of a turn then flip it and then do it in the other order and the picture will be facing in the opposite direction now galois produced some laws for how these tables -- how symmetries interact it 's almost like little sudoku tables you do n't see any symmetry twice in any row or column and using those rules he was able to say that there are in fact only two objects with six symmetries and they 'll be the same as the symmetries of the triangle or the symmetries of the six-pointed starfish i think this is an amazing development it 's almost like the concept of number being developed for symmetry in the front here i 've got one two three people sitting on one two three chairs the people on the chairs are very different but the number the abstract idea of the number is the same and we can see this now : we go back to the walls in the alhambra here are two very different walls very different geometric pictures but using the language of galois we can understand that the underlying abstract symmetries of these things are actually the same for example let 's take this beautiful wall with the triangles with a little twist on them you can rotate them by a sixth of a turn if you ignore the colors we 're not matching up the colors but the shapes match up if i rotate by a sixth of a turn around the point where all the triangles meet what about the center of a triangle i can rotate by a third of a turn around the center of the triangle and everything matches up and then there is an interesting place halfway along an edge where i can rotate by 180 degrees and all the tiles match up again so rotate along halfway along the edge and they all match up now let 's move to the very different-looking wall in the alhambra and we find the same symmetries here and the same interaction so there was a sixth of a turn a third of a turn where the z pieces meet and the half a turn is halfway between the six pointed stars and although these walls look very different galois has produced a language to say that in fact the symmetries underlying these are exactly the same and it 's a symmetry we call 6-3-2 here is another example in the alhambra this is a wall a ceiling and a floor they all look very different but this language allows us to say that they are representations of the same symmetrical abstract object which we call 4-4-2 nothing to do with football but because of the fact that there are two places where you can rotate by a quarter of a turn and one by half a turn now this power of the language is even more because galois can say " did the moorish artists discover all of the possible symmetries on the walls in the alhambra " and it turns out they almost did you can prove using galois ' language there are actually only 17 different symmetries that you can do in the walls in the alhambra and they if you try to produce a different wall with this 18th one it will have to have the same symmetries as one of these 17 but these are things that we can see and the power of galois ' mathematical language is it also allows us to create symmetrical objects in the unseen world beyond the two-dimensional three-dimensional all the way through to the four- or five- or infinite-dimensional space and that 's where i work i create mathematical objects symmetrical objects using galois ' language in very high dimensional spaces so i think it 's a great example of things unseen which the power of mathematical language allows you to create so like galois i stayed up all last night creating a new mathematical symmetrical object for you and i 've got a picture of it here well unfortunately it is n't really a picture if i could have my board at the side here great excellent here we are unfortunately i ca n't show you a picture of this symmetrical object but here is the language which describes how the symmetries interact now this new symmetrical object does not have a name yet now people like getting their names on things on craters on the moon or new species of animals so i 'm going to give you the chance to get your name on a new symmetrical object which has n't been named before and this thing -- species die away and moons kind of get hit by meteors and explode -- but this mathematical object will live forever it will make you immortal in order to win this symmetrical object what you have to do is to answer the question i asked you at the beginning how many symmetries does a rubik 's cube have okay i 'm going to sort you out rather than you all shouting out i want you to count how many digits there are in that number okay if you 've got it as a factorial you 've got to expand the factorials okay now if you want to play i want you to stand up okay if you think you 've got an estimate for how many digits right -- we 've already got one competitor here if you all stay down he wins it automatically okay excellent so we 've got four here five six great excellent that should get us going all right anybody with five or less digits you 've got to sit down because you 've underestimated five or less digits so if you 're in the tens of thousands you 've got to sit down 60 digits or more you 've got to sit down you 've overestimated 20 digits or less sit down how many digits are there in your number two so you should have sat down earlier let 's have the other ones who sat down during the 20 up again okay if i told you 20 or less stand up because this one i think there were a few here the people who just last sat down okay how many digits do you have in your number 21 okay good how many do you have in yours 18 so it goes to this lady here 21 is the closest it actually has -- the number of symmetries in the rubik 's cube has 25 digits so now i need to name this object so what is your name i need your surname symmetrical objects generally -- spell it for me g-h-e-z no so2 has already been used actually in the mathematical language so you ca n't have that one so ghez there we go that 's your new symmetrical object you are now immortal and if you 'd like your own symmetrical object i have a project raising money for a charity in guatemala where i will stay up all night and devise an object for you for a donation to this charity to help kids get into education in guatemala and i think what drives me as a mathematician are those things which are not seen the things that we have n't discovered it 's all the unanswered questions which make mathematics a living subject and i will always come back to this quote from the japanese " essays in idleness " : " in everything uniformity is undesirable leaving something incomplete makes it interesting and gives one the feeling that there is room for growth " thank you welcome to africa ! or rather i should say welcome home because this is where it all really began is n't it looking at fossils dating back several millions of years -- it all points to evidence that life for the human species as we know it began right here we are on an amazing journey the next four days you 're going to hear stories of " africa : the next chapter " fantastic tales anecdotes from speakers but i want to turn that upside down for a moment and get something out on the table and clear the air so to say what 's the worst thing you 've ever heard about africa and this is not a rhetorical question i actually want answers from you go for it ! the worst famine corruption more genocide aids slavery that 's enough we 've all heard these things but this is about africa the story we have not heard the stories that we want to know and the stories that do exist about positive tales a part of my talk is going to be about investment opportunities that exist on this continent to separate the rhetoric from the reality the fact from the fiction to go to the actual data and statistics that exist about the actual things that are happening on the ground that make africa a realistic investment opportunity and option for you so let 's get going because africa to some degree is on a turnaround a turnaround in terms of how it manages its image and how it takes control of its own destiny and turnarounds are part and parcel of what i have focused on for most of my professional career and it all started almost a decade ago as a young consultant at mckinsey & amp ; company at their first african office in johannesburg and there we worked with leading ceos on african issues and african companies on turnarounds making the companies not just the best in africa but the best globally but i really formalized this focus on turnarounds when i was completing my mba in the united states it all began with a fantastic phone call it was from rosabeth moss kanter harvard business school guru and a professor of mine and she said " i want to write a case euvin -- a case on a public-sector leader that has lessons for the corporate world " and the leader that came to mind was nelson mandela because nelson mandela as he took over power as the first democratically-elected president of south africa faced a situation of a country that could have slid into the abyss of chaos but he started the country on a path of a positive cycle now the case " nelson mandela : change leader " became part of the research base for a chapter in rosabeth 's new book called " confidence " and " confidence " became a new york times bestseller and topped business week 's hardcover bestseller list and why i tell you this story is because later when i was interviewed on sabc africa on a pan-african broadcast they asked " what is your key lesson or the key thing you enjoy the most " -- because it was a huge privilege to be part of such a project the lesson from that was that it was africa -- an african story -- that was used to share news with the rest of the world of what the benchmark can be for corporate turnarounds africa was being used as a success story ! so i want to share with you a personal story about a turnaround or a transformation and that has to do with me because in 1994 i packed a few things into a backpack and headed off for a year of travel in the middle of my university career you should have seen my parents ' reaction ! but very soon i found myself from the southern part of africa in south africa -- at the very north in egypt and i sought out the most remote places i went to the siwa oasis that was one of my stops and the siwa oasis is famous for several things but the key thing is that it was the place that alexander the great went to when he wanted to find out what his destiny had in store for him and legend has it that alexander trekked through this desert half his battalion was wiped out in the sandstorm and myth says that he had an audience with the oracle and it foretold his destiny of greatness this was 300 bc so africa had long been seen as a place to go to for answers now the thing i remember about siwa was the magical view of the sky at night with no natural light source siva is one of these amazing places that when you look up you see a perfect tapestry fast forward to 2002 i 'm sitting in cambridge massachusetts at the healthcare development conference and i see the same picture but from the opposite side a satellite picture looking down at the earth and it was that picture that made such a profound impact on me because i 'll never forget it i remember the very moment and i wanted to share that image with you of what i saw at that point the first thing that i saw was north america at night -- glowing in all its glory a warm feeling light and then i saw it -- africa quite literally the " dark continent " and while africa may be dark the thing that brought the message home to me was that this is the challenge we are facing but it 's also the opportunity because whilst africa may be dark -- other than the few specks that exist north and in the south and other areas -- it 's aglow with the light in the hearts of the millions of people that are there entrepreneurs dynamic people people with hope it was george kimble the geographer who said that " the only thing dark about africa is our ignorance of it " so let 's start shedding light on this amazing eclectic continent that has so much to offer let 's start unpacking it africa is the second-largest continent a landmass second from asia it also is the second most populated continent with 900 million people in fact -- coming back to the land mass -- africa is so big that you could fit in the continental united states china and the entire europe into africa and still have space africa is home to over 1,000 languages -- 2,000 is another estimate that 's out there -- with over 2,000 languages and dialects but you could say " invest in africa in over 1,000 languages and it would n't make a difference " what does the data say as an investment banker i 'm in the cross-flow of information and the changes that are taking place in capital markets so i want to share with you some of these bellwether signals or signs and winds of change that are sweeping this continent so let 's start on that and let 's start at the high level on the macro-factors inflation in general is coming down across africa -- that 's the first sign -- in many countries reaching double-digit figures so let 's start looking at some of those i call it my z.e.n cluster zambia : from 2004 to 2006 moves from the 18 percent in inflation to the nine percent egypt : from the 16 percent to about 8.4 percent nigeria : a similar situation from the 16 percent to the eight percent single digits more fascinating you have other countries -- south africa mauritius namibia -- all in single digits but that 's just part of the story you have a similar trend with currencies -- currencies going through an extreme time of stability but that 's looking at the big picture and the first myth to dispel is that africa is not a country it 's made up -- it 's made up of 53 different countries so the very definition -- to say " invest in africa " is a no-go it 's meaningless each country has a unique value proposition you can make money you can lose money in africa but opportunities boy oh boy they exist and this is what today is about -- it 's about discussing those very opportunities so let 's start getting into the countries and into the specific material and data i was recently elected as emeka mentioned as the president of the south african chamber of commerce in america and i 'm very proud and happy to be in that role because it is a fascinating position to be in to hear this dialogue that 's just increasing in tenor and velocity of decisions about trade and companies wanting to come so the first port of call : let 's talk a little bit about south africa but not the south africa we always talk about -- the gold the minerals the first world infrastructure -- a bit about the other side of it for example south africa was recently voted as the top destination for the top 1,000 uk companies for offshore call-centers same language timeline et cetera makes sense other headlines that have recently reached south africa were bain capital and kkr the big boys of private equity headline in south africa : " they have landed " quite ominous but what were they there for to acquire assets bing capital 's acquisition of edcon a large retailer is testimony to the confidence they are starting to place in the economy because it is actually a long-term play being a retailer it is a play on the belief that this middle-class that 's growing will continue to grow that the boom and the confidence in consumer spending will continue but the story of africa and my focus is beyond south africa because there 's so much happening undoubtedly nigeria is clearly a hot spot challenges -- and we will hear a lot about nigeria in these four days but looking at goldman sachs ' work -- we had the famous bric report the new report " the next eleven " highlights that by 2020 nigeria is going to be amongst the top 10 economies in the world it 's an investment opportunity think about that is anyone -- our banks our investors -- seriously thinking about going to nigeria if you have n't why not what 's going on in nigeria a couple of things i want to talk about it from the perspective of capital markets bellwether signs again guarantee trust bank recently issued the first euro bond out of africa and this excludes south africa but the first eurobond the raising of international capital offshore off its own balance sheet without any sovereign backing -- that is an indication of the confidence that is taking place in that economy without any sovereign backing a nigerian company raising capital offshore it 's just a sign of things to come looking at the oil industry africa provides 18 percent of the u.s. 's oil supply with the middle east just 16 percent it 's an important strategic partner let 's put nigeria in perspective 2.2 to 2.4 million barrels of oil a day -- the same league as kuwait the same league as venezuela but with africa let 's start being careful about this and emeka and i have had these discussions we have to move away from what 's called " the curse of the commodities " because it 's not about oil it 's not about commodities for africa to truly be sustainable we have to move beyond to other industries so let 's unpack those very quickly and i 'm going to move through these very very very fast because i can see that clock counting down what else is going on there egypt egypt is launching a first large industrial zone -- 2.8 billion investment the announcement just came out the last few weeks close to the mediterranean near alexandria -- textiles petrochemicals it 's being managed by a singaporean-based management company so they want to emerge as an industrial powerhouse across the industries -- away from oil let 's look at agriculture let 's look at forestry what 's going on there in tanzania last week we had the launch of the east african organic produce standard again gathering together farmers gathering together stakeholders in east africa to get standards for organic produce better prices it ties in with small-scale farmers in terms of no pesticides no fertilizers again opportunity to tackle markets to get that higher price uganda : the new forest company replanting and redeveloping their forests why is that important as the energy needs are met and electricity is needed [ we will need ] poles for rolling out electricity but here is the sweetener in the deal they 're going to be tapping into carbon credits let 's go back to nigeria the banking sector has undergone tremendous transformation from over 80 banks to 25 banks strengthening of the system but what 's going on there only 10 percent of the country is banked the largest population in africa is in nigeria 135 million-plus people think about that there are only 700 atms in the country opportunity the same for telecoms across the country now let 's look at the continent as a whole people look at the roads for example and they 'd say " angola : 90 percent of roads are untarred ah problem ! " it 's more expensive to transport goods prices of goods go up inflation is affected nigeria : 70 percent of roads are untarred zambia : 80 percent in general more than 50 percent of roads are untarred this is an opportunity ! energy needs -- it 's an opportunity so what are the signs that things are fundamentally changing let 's look at the stock markets in africa if i had to ask you " in 2005 what was the best performing stock market or stock exchange in the world " would egypt come to mind in 2005 the egyptian stock exchange returned over 145 percent what 's going on in some of the other countries let 's look at some 2006 numbers kenya : over 60 percent nigeria : over 40 percent south africa : in the 20 percents high ones these are the trends that are taking place but in any investment decision the key question is " what is my alternative investment " because in africa today we are competing globally for capital and global capital is agnostic -- it has no loyalties there 's an overhang of capital in the u.s. and the key is yield pickup what africa is providing is a diversification play and also opportunities for yield pickup for the investor that 's aware of what he or she is doing now when looking at africa vis-a-vis other things and countries in africa vis-a-vis other things comparisons become important 10 years ago there were very few countries that received sovereign ratings from the standard & amp ; poors moody 's and fitch 's today 16 african countries and growing have sovereign country ratings what does this mean take nigeria again : double b-minus -- in the league of ukraine and turkey immediately we have a comparison the backbone of making investment decisions for global holders of capital some other figures south africa : triple b-plus botswana : a-plus bakino faso : b-minus and so on in fact one of the big agencies is setting up an office in africa why are they doing that because they expect investment to follow so one of the big bellwethers and one of my final points i want to mention is the interesting thing i read is that cnbc has launched their first african channel why is cnbc doing this it 's the 24-hour rolling african news channel they 're doing it because they are expecting things to happen me and you the investments we are going to be making the investments the world is going to be making -- that 's the 24-hour news channel dedicated to africa so that 's the change that 's coming down the pipeline so in conclusion i want to turn back to that very slide that made such a deep impact on me all those years ago this time [ i 'll ] give you the entire picture that i saw in 2002 and ask you that when you think about what your role can be in africa think about your journey in terms of bringing light to this continent because there are amazing opportunities available and think about the concept of transformation in the back of your mind because things can be turned around rather quickly in 1899 joseph conrad released " the heart of darkness " a tale of grim horror along the congo river if one looks carefully on the congo river is one of those bright lights and that 's the very congo river generating light -- the old heart of darkness now generating light with hydro-electric power that is a transformation in power of ideas so the next step over the next four days is us exploring more of these ideas and perchance if you can always keep this picture in your mind that when we convene maybe in the distant future in 2020 that picture will look very different thank you it is interesting that in the united states the most significant health-care budget goes to cardiovascular disease care whether it 's private or public there 's no comparison at all in africa -- where it is a major killer -- it is totally ignored and that situation can not be right we must do something about it a health status of a nation parallels development of that nation 17 million people die every year from heart disease 32 million heart attacks and strokes occur most of this is in developing countries and the majority is in africa 85 percent of global disease burden for cardiovascular disease is in developing countries -- not in the west -- and yet 90 percent of the resources are in the west who is at risk people like you it 's not just the africans that should be concerned about that all friends of africa that will have reason to be in africa at some point in time should be very concerned about this deplorable situation has anyone here wondered what will happen if you go back to your room at night and you start getting chest pains shortness of breath sweating you 're having a heart attack what are you going to do will you fly back to the u.s. germany europe no you will die 50 percent will die within 24 hours if not treated this is what 's going on in a look at the map of the u.s. -- the graph here 10 million people here 10 million here by the time you get to 50 it 's almost no one left in nigeria -- life expectancy is 47 it 's not because some people do n't survive childhood illnesses -- they do -- but they do not survive after the time that they reach about 45 years old and 50 years old and those are the times they 're most productive those are the times that they should be contributing to africa 's development but they 're not there the best way to spiral into a cycle of poverty is to kill the parents if you can not secure the parents you can not guarantee the security of the african child what are the risk factors it 's very well known i 'm not going to spend a lot of time on those these are just for information : hypertension diabetes obesity lack of exercise the usual suspects right here in tanzania 30 percent of individuals have hypertension 20 percent are getting treated only less than one percent are adequately treated if we can treat hypertension alone in africa we 'll save 250,000 lives a year that 's quite significant ! easy to treat look at the situation in mauritius in eight short years -- we 're here talking about hiv malaria which is all good we can not make the mistakes we 've made with malaria and hiv in eight short years non-communicable diseases will become the leading causes of death in africa that is something to keep in mind we ca n't deal with it with situations like this this is a typical african hospital we ca n't depend on the elites -- they go to usa germany u.k. for treatment unbelievable you ca n't depend on foreign aid alone here is the situation : countries are turning inwards post-9/11 [ the ] united states has had a lot of trouble to deal with their own internal issues so they spend their money trying to fix those problems you ca n't rightly -- it 's not their responsibility it is my responsibility i have to take care of my own problems if they help that 's good ! but that is not my expectation these worsening indices of health care or health studies in africa demand a new look we can not keep on doing things the way we 've always done them if they have not worked we have to look for alternative solutions i 'm here to talk to you about solutions this has been -- what has been a difficult sign to some of us several years ago we started thinking about it everyone knows the problem no one knows what the solutions are we decided that we needed to put our money where our mouth is everyone is ready to throw in money in terms of free money aid to developing countries talk about sustainable investment no one is interested you ca n't raise money i have done businesses in healthcare in the united states -- i live in nashville tennessee health care capital of america [ it 's ] very easy to raise money for health-care ventures but start telling them you know we 're going to try to do it in nigeria -- everyone runs away that is totally wrong those of you in the audience here if you want to help africa invest money in sustainable development let me lead you through a day in the life of the heart institute so you get a glimpse of what we do and i 'll talk a little bit more about it what we have done is to show that high-quality health care comparable to the best anywhere in the world can be done in a developing country environment we have 25 positions right now -- all of them trained board certified in the usa canada or britain we have every modality that can be done in vanderbilt cleveland clinic -- everywhere in the u.s. -- and we do it for about 10 percent of the cost that you will need to do those things in the united states additionally we have a policy that no one is ever turned away because of ability to pay we take care of everyone whether you have one dollar two dollars -- it does n't matter and i will tell you how we 're able to do it we make sure that we select our equipment properly we go for modular units units that have multi-modality functions have modular components easy to repair and because of that we do not take things that are not durable and can not last we emphasize training and we make sure that this process is regenerative very soon we will all be dead and gone but the problems will stay unless we have people taking over from where we stopped we made sure that we produced some things ourselves we do not buy unit doses of radiopharmaceuticals we get the generators from the companies we manufacture them in-house ourselves that keeps the costs down so for a radiopharmaceutical in the u.s. -- that you 'll get a unit dose for 250 dollars -- when we 're finished manufacturing it in-house we come at a price of about two dollars we recognize that the only way to bridge the gap between the rich and poor countries is through education and technology all these problems we 're talking about -- if we bring development they will all disappear technology is a great equalizer how do we make it work it 's been proved : self-care is cost-effective it extends opportunity to the rural centers and we can use expertise in a very smart way this is the way our centers are set up we currently have three locations in the caribbean and we 're planning a fourth one and we have now decided to go into africa we will be doing the west african heart institute in port harcourt nigeria that project will be starting within the next few months we hope to open in 2008-09 and we will do other centers this model can be adapted to every disease process all the units all the centers are linked through a switched hub to a central server and all the images are populated to review stations and we designed this telemedicine solution it 's proprietary to us and we are happy to share what we have learned with anyone who is interested in doing it you can still be profitable we make sure that the telemedicine platform gives access to expert medical specialists anywhere in the world just by a click of the button i 'll lead you through to see how this happens this is at the heart institute the doctors from anywhere can log in i can call you in switzerland and say " listen go into our system look at mrs. jones look at the study tell me what you think " they 'll give me that information and we 'll make the care of the patient better the patient does n't have to travel he does n't have to experience the anxiety of not knowing because of limited expertise we also use [ an ] electronic medical record system i 'm happy to say that the things we have implemented -- 80 percent of u.s. practices do not have them and yet the technology is there but you know they have that luxury because if you ca n't get it in nashville you can travel to birmingham two hours away and you 'll get it if you ca n't get it in cleveland you can go to cincinnati we do n't have that luxury so we have to make it happen when we do it we will put the cost of care down and we 'll extend it to the rural centers and make it affordable and everyone will get the care they deserve it can not just be technology we recognize that prevention must be part of the solution -- we emphasize that but you know you have to tell people what can be done it 's not possible to tell people to do what is going to be expensive and they go home and ca n't do it they need to be alive they need to feed we recommend exercise as the most effective simple easy thing to do we have had walks every year -- every march april we form people into groups and make them go into challenges which group loses the most weight we give them prizes which groups record more walking distance by pedometer we give them prizes we do this constantly we encourage them to bring children that way we start exposing the children from very early on on what these issues are because once they learn it they will stay with it in doing this we have created at least 100 skilled jobs in jamaica alone and these are physicians with expertise and special training we have taken care of over 1,000 indigent patients that could have died including four free pacemakers in patients with complete heart block for those that understand cardiology complete heart block means certain death if you do n't get this pacemaker you will be dead so we are pleased with that indirectly we have saved the government of jamaica five million dollars from people that would have gone to miami or atlanta for care and we 've hopefully saved a lot of lives by the end of this year we would have contributed over one million dollars in indigent care in the first four months it 's been 340,000 dollars averaging 85,000 dollars a month the government will not do that because they have competing needs they need to put resources elsewhere but we can still do it people say " how can you do that " this is how we can do that at least 4,000 rich jamaicans that were heading to miami for treatment have self-confessed that they did not go to miami because of the heart institute of the caribbean and if they went to miami they will spend significantly more -- eight to 10 times more and they feel happy spending it at home getting the same quality of care and for that money -- for every one patient that has the money to pay it gives us an opportunity to take care of at least four people that do not have the resources to pay for this to work this progress must be sustainable so we emphasize training training is critical we have gone further : we have formed a relationship with the university of technology jamaica where i now have an appointment and we are starting a biomedical engineering program so that we will train people locally who can repair that equipment that way we 're not going to deal with obsolescence and all those kinds of issues we 're also starting ancillary health-care technology training programs -- training people in echocardiography cardiac ultrasound those kinds of things now with that kind of training it gives people motivation because now they will get a bachelors degree in medical imaging and all that kind of stuff in the process i want you to just hear from the trainees themselves what it has meant for them dr. jason topping : my name is jason topping i 'm a senior resident in anesthesia in intensive care at the university hospital of the west indies i came to the heart institute in 2006 as part of my elective in my anesthesia and intensive care program i spent three months at the heart institute there 's been no doubt around my colleagues about the utility of the training i received here and i think there 's been an increased interest now in -- particularly in echocardiography and its use in our setting sharon lazarus : i am an echocardiographer at the heart institute of the caribbean since the past two years i received training at this institution i think this aspect of training in cardiology that the heart institute of the caribbean has introduced in jamaica is very important in terms of diagnosing cardiac diseases ernest madu : the lesson in this is that it can be done and it can be sustained and you can make it possible for everyone who are we to decide that poor people can not get the best care when have you been appointed to play god it is not my decision my job is to make sure that every person no matter what fate has assigned to you will have the opportunity to get the best quality health care in life next stop is west african heart institute that we are going to be doing in port harcourt nigeria as i said before we will do other centers across west africa we will extend the same system into other areas like dialysis treatment and anyone who is interested in doing it in any health care situation we will be happy to assist you and tell you how we 've done it and how you can do it if we do this we can change the face of health care in africa africa has been good to us ; it is time for us to give back to africa i am going those who want to come i welcome you to come along with me thank you this is aunt zip from sodom north carolina she was 105 years old when i took this picture she was always saying things that made me stop and think like " time may be a great healer but it ai n't no beauty specialist " she said " be good to your friends why without them you 'd be a total stranger " this is one of her songs let 's see if we can get into the flow here and all do this one together and i 'm going to have michael manring play bass with me give him a big old hand one

you think you can have anything you want you do n't know how hard it is to earn money your dad works so hard you think money grows on trees you 've never worked a day in your lives you boys make me so mad you 're going to get a job this summer " she pulled the car over ; she said " get out of the car " my brother and i stepped out of the car we were standing on the edge of thousands of acres of cotton there were about a hundred black folks out there picking my mom grabbed us by the shoulders she marched us out in the field she went up to the foreman ; she said " i 've got these two little boys never worked a day in their lives " of course we were just eight and 10 she said " would you put them to work " well that must have seemed like a funny idea to that foreman : put these two middle-class little white boys out in a cotton field in august in texas -- it 's hot so he gave us each a cotton sack about 10 feet long about that big around and we started picking now cotton is soft but the outside of the plant is just full of stickers and if you do n't know what you 're doing your hands are bleeding in no time and my brother and i started to pick it and our hands were startin ' to bleed and then -- " mom ! " and mom was just sitting by the car like this she was n't going to give up well the foreman could see he was in over his head i guess he kind of just snuck up behind us and he sang out in a low voice he just sang : " well there 's a long white robe in heaven i know do n't want it to leave me behind well there 's a long white robe in heaven i know do n't want it to leave me behind " and from all around as people started singing and answering back he sang : " good news good news : chariot 's coming good news : chariot 's coming good news : chariot 's coming and i do n't want it to leave me behind " now my brother and i had never heard anything like that in our whole lives it was so beautiful we sat there all day picking cotton without complaining without crying while they sang things like : " oh mary do n't you weep do n't you moan " and " wade in the water " and " i done done " " this little light of mine " finally by the end of the day we 'd each picked about a quarter of a bag of cotton but the foreman was kind enough to give us each a check for a dollar but my mother would never let us cash it i 'm 57 ; still have the check now my mother hoped that we learned from that the value of hard work but if you have children you know it does n't often work that way no we learned something else the first thing i learned that day was that i never ever wanted to work that hard again and pretty much never did but i also learned that some people in this world do have to work that hard every day and that was an eye-opener and i also learned that a great song can make hard work go a little easier and it also can bring the group together in a way that nothing else can now i was just a little eight-year-old boy that day when my mama put me out of the car in that hot texas cotton field i was n't even aware of music -- not even aware of it but that day in the cotton field out there picking when those people started singing i realized i was in the very heart of real music and that 's where i 've wanted to be ever since try this old song with me i sing : well there 's a long white robe in heaven i know well there 's a long white robe in heaven i know do n't want it to leave me behind good news good news : chariot 's coming good news : chariot 's coming good news : chariot 's coming and i do n't want it to leave me -- it 's been a while since you guys have been picking your last bale of cotton is n't it let 's try it one more time there 's a starry crown in heaven i know do n't want it to leave me behind there 's a starry crown in heaven i know do n't want it to leave me behind good news : chariot 's coming good news : chariot 's coming good news : chariot 's coming and i do n't want it to leave me behind it was a few years ago but i sort of remembered this story and i told it at a concert my mom was in the audience after the -- she was glad to have a story about herself of course but after the concert she came up and she said " david i 've got to tell you something i set that whole thing up i set it up with the foreman i set it up with the owner of the land i just wanted you boys to learn the value of hard work i did n't know it was going to make you fall in love with music though " let 's try good news : chariot 's coming good news : chariot 's coming good news : chariot 's coming and i do n't want it to leave me behind well this is the steel guitar it 's an american-made instrument it was originally made by the dopyera brothers who later on made the dobro which is a wood-bodied instrument with a metal cone for -- where the sound comes from it 's usually played flat on your lap it was made to play hawaiian music back in the 1920s before they had electric guitars trying to make a loud guitar and then african-american folks figured out you could take a broken bottle neck just like that -- a nice merlot works very well that wine we had yesterday would have been perfect break it off put it on your finger and slide into the notes this instrument pretty much saved my life fifteen years ago 14 years ago i guess this year my wife and i lost our daughter sarah jane in a car accident and it was the most -- it almost took me out -- it almost took me out of this world and i think i learned a lot about what happiness was by going through such unbelievable grief just standing on the edge of that abyss and just wanting to jump in i had to make lists of reasons to stay alive i had to sit down and make lists because i was ready to go ; i was ready to check out of this world and you know at the top of the list of course were jenny and my son zeb my parents -- i did n't want to hurt them but then when i thought about it beyond that it was very simple things i did n't care about -- i had a radio show i have a radio show on public radio " riverwalk " i did n't care about that i did n't care about awards or money or anything nothing nothing on the list it would be stuff like seeing the daffodils bloom in the spring the smell of new-mown hay catching a wave and bodysurfing the touch of a baby 's hand the sound of doc watson playing the guitar listening to old records of muddy waters and uncle dave macon and for me the sound of a steel guitar because one of my parents ' neighbors just gave me one of these things and i would sit around with it and i did n't know how to play it but i would just play stuff as sad as i could play and it was the only instrument that of all the ones that i play that would really make that connection this is a song that came out of that well i hear you 're having trouble lord i hate to hear that news if you want to talk about it you know i will listen to you through words no longer say it ; let me tell you what i always do i just break off another bottleneck and play these steel guitar blues people say " oh snap out of it ! " oh yeah that 's easier said than done while you can hardly move they 're running around having all kinds of fun sometimes i think it 's better just to sink way down in your funky mood 'til you can rise up humming these steel guitar blues now you can try to keep it all inside with drink and drugs and cigarettes but you know that 's not going to get you where you want to get but i got some medicine here that just might shake things loose call me in the morning after a dose of these steel guitar blues open up now oh i think i 've got time to tell you about this my dad was an inventor we moved to california when sputnik went up in 1957 and he was working on gyroscopes ; he has a number of patents for that kind of thing and we moved across the street from michael and john whitney they were about my age john went on and michael did too to become some of the inventors of computer animation michael 's dad was working on something called the computer this was 1957 i was a little 10-year-old kid ; i did n't know what that was but he took me down to see one you know what they were making it was like a library just full of vacuum tubes as far as you could see just floors and floors of these things and one of the engineers said some day you 're going to be able to put this thing in your pocket i thought damn those are going to be some big pants ! so that christmas -- maybe i 've got time for this -- that christmas i got the mister wizard fun-o-rama chemistry set well i wanted to be an inventor just like my dad ; so did michael his great-granddad had been eli whitney the inventor of the cotton gin so we looked in that -- this was a commercial chemistry set it had three chemicals we were really surprised to see : sulfur potassium nitrate and charcoal man we were only 10 but we knew that made gunpowder we made up a little batch and we put it on the driveway and we threw a match and phew it flared up ah it was great well obviously the next thing to do was build a cannon so we went over into michael 's garage -- his dad had all kinds of stuff and we put a pipe in the vice there and screwed a cap on the end of the pipe drilled a hole in the back of the pipe took some of our firecrackers pulled out the fuses tied them together put them in the back there and -- down in that hole -- and then stuffed some of our gunpowder down that pipe and put three ball bearings on the top in the garage we were n't stupid : we put up a sheet of plywood about five feet in front of it we stood back we lit that thing and they flew out of there -- they went through that plywood like it was paper through the garage two of them landed in the side door of his new citroen we tore everything down and buried it in his backyard that was pacific palisades ; it probably is still there back there well my brother heard that we had made gunpowder he and his buddies they were older and they were pretty mean they said they were going to beat us up if we did n't make some gunpowder for them we said well what are you going to do with it they said we 're going to melt it down and make rocket fuel sure we 'll make you a big batch so we made them a big batch and it was in my -- now we 'd just moved here we 'd just moved to california mom had redone the kitchen ; mom was gone that day we had a pie tin it became chris berquist 's job to do the melting down michael and i were standing way at the side of the kitchen he said " yeah hey it 's melting yeah the sulfur 's melting no problem yeah you know " it just flared up and he turned around and he looked like this no hair no eyelashes no nothing there were big welts all over my mom 's kitchen cabinet ; the air was the just full of black smoke she came home she took that chemistry set away and we never saw it again but we thought of it often because every time she 'd cook tuna surprise it made -- tasted faintly of gunpowder so i like to invent things too and i think i 'll close out my set with something i invented a good while back when drum machines were new i got to thinking why could n't you take the oldest form of music the hambone rhythms and combine it with the newest technology i call this thunderwear at that time drum triggers were new and so i put them all together and sewed 12 of them in this suit i showed you some of the hambone rhythms yesterday ; i 'm going to be doing some of the same ones i have a trigger here trigger here here here right there it 's going to really hurt if i do n't take that off okay now the drum triggers go out my tail here into the drum machine and they can make various sounds like drums so let me put them all together and also i can change the sounds by stepping on this pedal right here and -- let me just close out here by doing you a little hambone solo or something like this thank you folks chris has been so nice i do n't know how you keep it up chris i really do n't so nice all week he 's the kind of man you could say to " chris i 'm really sorry i 've crashed your car and it gets worse i crashed it into your house your house has caught fire and what 's more your wife has just run off with your best friend " and you know that chris would say " thank you " " thank you for sharing that 's really interesting " " thank you for taking me to a place that i did n't know existed thank you " one of the -- thank you for inviting us one of the things about appearing later on in the ted week is that gradually as the days go by all the other speakers cover most of what you were going to say nuclear fusion i had about 10 minutes on that spectroscopy that was another one parallel universes and so this morning i thought " oh well i 'll just do a card trick " that one 's gone as well and today is emmanuel 's day i think we 've agreed that already have n't we emmanuel absolutely i was planning on finishing on a dance â€¦ so that 's going to look pretty shabby now so what i thought i 'd do is -- in honor of emmanuel -- is what i can do is to launch today the first ted global auction if i could start this is the enigma decoding machine who will start me with $ 1,000 anyone thank you bruno 's face just then he said " no do n't go through this do n't please do n't do n't go through this do n't do it " i 'm worried when i first got the invitation they said somewhere in the thing they said " 15 minutes to change the world your moment onstage " 15 minutes to change the world i do n't know about you it takes me 15 minutes to change a plug so the idea of changing the world is really quite an extraordinary one well of course now we know we do n't have to change a plug now we 've seen that wonderful demonstration of the wireless electric -- fantastic you know it inspires us 300 years ago he 'd have been burnt at the stake for that and now it 's an idea it 's great it 's fantastic but you do meet some fantastic people people who look at the world in a totally different way yesterday david deutsch another one who covered most of what i was going to say but when you think of the world in that way it does make going to starbucks a whole new experience do n't you think i mean he must walk in and they will say " would you like a macchiato or a latte or an americano or a cappuccino " and he 'll say " you 're offering me things that are infinitely variable " " how can your coffee be true " and they will say " would you mind if i serve the next customer " and elaine morgan yesterday was n't she wonderful fantastic really good her talk about the aquatic ape and the link of course the link between darwinism and the fact that we are all naked beneath this -- we 're not hirsute and we can swim rather well and she said you know she 's 90 she 's running out of time she said and she 's desperate to find more evidence for the link and i think " i 'm sitting next to lewis pugh " this man has swum around the north pole what more evidence do you want and there he is that 's how ted brings these connections together i was n't here on tuesday i did n't actually see gordon brown 's job application -- um sorry i 'm so sorry i 'm so sorry no no no no ahh â€¦ : " global problems require scottish solutions " the problem i have is because gordon brown he comes onstage and he looks for all the world like a man who 's just taken the head off a bear suit : " hello can i tell you what happened in the woods back there uh no " " i 'm sorry i 've only got 18 minutes 18 minutes to talk about saving the world saving the planet global institutions our work on climate change i 've only got 18 minutes unfortunately i 'm not able to tell you about all the wonderful things we 're doing to promote the climate change agenda in great britain like the third runway we 're planning at heathrow airport â€¦ " " the large coal-fired power station we 're building at king 's north and of course the exciting news that only today only this week britain 's only manufacturer of wind turbines has been forced to close no time unfortunately to mention those " " british jobs for scottish people â€¦ no " " christian principles christian values thou shalt not kill thou shalt not steal thou shalt not covet thy neighbor 's wife " " although to be honest when i was at number 11 that was never going to be a problem " : " yeah alright come on eh alright gordon come on eh i just can i just say a few things about first about cherie because she 's a wonderful lady my wife with a wonderful smile that reminds me i must post that letter " " i just think you know what people forget gordon and i we always got on perfectly well alright it was never exactly 'brokeback mountain ' " " you know i wrote to him just before i left office i said 'can i rely on your support for the next month ' and he wrote back he said 'no you ca n't ' which kind of surprised me because i 'd never seen 'ca n't ' spelled that way before " another thing gordon could have mentioned in his speech to the mansion house in 2002 -- that was to the building ; the people were n't listening but the people when talking about the finance industry he said " what you as the city of london have done for financial services we as a government hope to do for the economy as a whole " when you think what 's happened to financial services and you see what 's happened to the economy you think " well there is a man who delivers on his promises " but we 're in a new world now we 're in a completely new world this is the first time that i can remember where if you get a letter from the bank manager about a loan you do n't know if you 're borrowing money from him or if he 's borrowing money from you am i right these extraordinary things icelandic internet accounts did anyone here have an icelandic internet account why would you do that why would -- it 's like one step up from replying to one of those emails from nigeria is n't it asking for your bank details and you know iceland it was never going to cut it it did n't have that kind of collateral what does it have it has fish that 's all that 's why the prime minister went on television he said " this has left us all with a very big haddock " a lot of what i do -- i have to try and make sense of things before i can make nonsense of them and making sense of the financial crisis is very very difficult luckily somebody like george bush was really helpful he summed it up really at a dinner he was speaking at a dinner he said " wall street got drunk " " and now it 's got a hangover " and that 's you know that 's something -- and that 's something we can relate to it 's certainly something he can relate to and the other one of course is donald rumsfeld who said " there are the known knowns the things we know we know and then you got the known unknowns the things we know we do n't know and then you got the unknown unknowns those are the things we do n't know we do n't know " and being english when i first heard that i thought " what a load of cock " and then you 're now well actually that 's what this is about this whole what ben bernanke has said the chaotic unwinding of the world 's financial system it 's about -- they do n't know they did n't know what they were doing in 2006 the head of the american mortgage bankers association said quote " as we can clearly see no seismic occurrence is about to overwhelm the u.s economy " now there is a man on top of his job and when the crisis was happening the head of quantitative equities at lehman brothers said " events which models predicted would happen once every 10,000 years happened every day for three days " so it 's extraordinary it 's a new world that 's very very difficult to make sense of but we have a new hope we have a new man america has now elected its first openly black president wonderful news not only that he 's left-handed have you noticed this how many people here are left-handed you see a lot of the people that i most admire they 're great artists great designers great thinkers they 're left-handed and somebody said to me last night you know being left-handed you have to learn to write without smudging the ink and somebody was talking about metaphors on monday and i thought what a wonderful metaphor is n't it an american president who has to write without smudging the ink you like that one as opposed to you could see george bush well what 's the metaphor there i think it would be something out of the aquatic ape thing would n't it " well you know i 'm sorry about that i 'm right-handed but i seem to have smudged that ink as well " but you know he 's gone now he 's gone that 's eight years of american history eight minutes of my act just gone like that " you know it 's the end of an error [ sic ] i happen to believe it was a great error i know folks said to me they believe it was one of the greatest errors in the history of the united states but we proved them wrong in iraq they said there was no link between iraq and al qaeda there is now " " but i have a message for the suicide bombers for those people who 've blown themselves up " " we 're going to find you " " we 're going to make sure you do n't do it again " but now he 's gone and it 's great to see one of the -- arguably one of the worst speech makers in american history now given way to one of the greatest in obama you were there maybe on the night of his victory and he spoke to the crowd in chicago he said " if there is anyone out there who still doubts that america is a place where all things are possible â€¦ " i ca n't do the whole thing because it would take too long it really would but you get the picture and then it goes to the inauguration and he and the chief justice they trip over each other they get their words wrong and they screw the thing up and there is george bush sitting there going " heh heh heh heh â€¦ " " not so easy is it heh heh heh " but the interesting thing is gordon brown was talking about cicero who said people would listen to a speech they said " great speech " and then they 'd listen to demosthenes and they 'd say " let 's march " and we all want to believe in president obama it 's rather like that line in the film " as good as it gets " do you remember that film with helen hunt and jack nicholson and helen hunt says to jack nicholson " what do you see in me " and jack nicholson just says " you make me want to be a better man " and you want a leader who inspires and challenges and makes you want to be a better citizen right but at the moment it 's a cicero thing we like what barack obama says but we do n't do anything about it so he comes over to this country and he says " we need a big fiscal stimulus " and everyone goes " great ! " he leaves the country and the french and the germans go " no no forget about that absolutely not " nothing happens he goes to strasburg he says " we need more boots on the ground in afghanistan " and everyone goes " great idea " he leaves people go " no no no we 're not going to do that 5,000 maximum and no rockets no no not going to do it " he goes to prague he says " we believe in a nuclear-free world " and it 's great to have an american president who can say the word " nuclear " let 's just point that out first do you remember that george bush " a nu-ca-ler " sorry what " a nu-ca-ler " could you say " avuncular " " avunclear " thank you very much but he says " we want a nuclear-free world " and that day north korea that very day north korea is just seeing if it can just get one over japan -- -- and land it before â€¦ so where do we look for inspiration we 've still got bill clinton " travels the world " " i believe i believe it was president dwight d. eisenhower who said â€¦ " " tell a lie ; it was diana ross â€¦ " " â€¦ who said reach out and touch â€¦ " " â€¦ somebody 's gla -- hand " " make this world a better place if you can i just think that 's important i really do and i was hoping hillary would get to the white house because she 'd have been out of our home for four years and i you know " " so when that did n't work out i had to make a few arrangements let me tell you " so there 's him in britain we have prince charles : " and the environment is so important all we can do my wife gets fed up with me constantly trying to push emissions up her agenda " or any south africans we have mandela to inspire mandela the great man mandela he 's been honored with a statue now the previous highest honor he had in britain was a visit from the team from ground force a gardening program " so nelson how would you like a nice water feature " " ahh listen to me mr titchmarsh " " i was held in prison for nearly 30 years on an island in the middle of the ocean why would i need a bloody water feature " very quickly : i was n't quite sure how to end this talk and then yesterday that man came up with a wonderful quote from the " japanese essays on idleness " which said it 's nice to have something which is unfinished because it implies there is still room for growth thank you very much indeed so anyway who am i i usually say to people when they say " what do you do " i say " i do hardware " because it sort of conveniently encompasses everything i do and i recently said that to a venture capitalist casually at some valley event to which he replied " how quaint " and i sort of really was dumbstruck and i really should have said something smart and now i 've had a little bit of time to think about it i would have said " well you know if we look at the next 100 years and we 've seen all these problems in the last few days most of the big issues -- clean water clean energy -- and they 're interchangeable in some respects -- and cleaner more functional materials -- they all look to me to be hardware problems this does n't mean we should ignore software or information or computation " and that 's in fact probably what i 'm going to try and tell you about so this talk is going to be about how do we make things and what are the new ways that we 're going to make things in the future now ted sends you a lot of spam if you 're a speaker about " do this do that " and you fill out all these forms and you do n't actually know how they 're going to describe you and it flashed across my desk that they were going to introduce me as a futurist and i 've always been nervous about the term " futurist " because you seem doomed to failure because you ca n't really predict it and i was laughing about this with the very smart colleagues i have and said " you know well if i have to talk about the future what is it " and george homsey a great guy said " oh the future is amazing it is so much stranger than you think we 're going to reprogram the bacteria in your gut and we 're going to make your poo smell like peppermint " so you may think that 's sort of really crazy but there are some pretty amazing things that are happening that make this possible so this is n't my work but it 's work of good friends of mine at mit this is called the registry of standard biological parts this is headed by drew endy and tom knight and a few other very very bright individuals basically what they 're doing is looking at biology as a programmable system literally think of proteins as subroutines that you can string together to execute a program now this is actually becoming such an interesting idea this is a state diagram that 's an extremely simple computer this one is a two-bit counter so that 's essentially the computational equivalent of two light switches and this is being built by a group of students at zurich for a design competition in biology and from the results of the same competition last year a university of texas team of students programmed bacteria so that they can detect light and switch on and off so this is interesting in the sense that you can now do " if-then-for " statements in materials in structure this is a pretty interesting trend because we used to live in a world where everyone 's said glibly " form follows function " but i think i 've sort of grown up in a world -- you listened to neil gershenfeld yesterday ; i was in a lab associated with his -- where it 's really a world where information defines form and function i spent six years thinking about that but to show you the power of art over science -- this is actually one of the cartoons i write these are called " howtoons " i work with a fabulous illustrator called nick dragotta took me six years at mit and about that many pages to describe what i was doing and it took him one page and so this is our muse tucker he 's an interesting little kid -- and his sister celine -- and what he 's doing here is observing the self-assembly of his cheerios in his cereal bowl and in fact you can program the self-assembly of things so he starts chocolate-dipping edges changing the hydrophobicity and the hydrophylicity in theory if you program those sufficiently you should be able to do something pretty interesting and make a very complex structure in this case he 's done self-replication of a complex 3d structure and that 's what i thought about for a long time because this is how we currently make things this is a silicon wafer and essentially that 's just a whole bunch of layers of two-dimensional stuff sort of layered up the feature side is -- you know people will say [ unclear ] down around about 65 nanometers now on the right that 's a radiolara that 's a unicellular organism ubiquitous in the oceans and that has feature sizes down to about 20 nanometers and it 's a complex 3d structure we could do a lot more with computers and things generally if we knew how to build things this way the secret to biology is it builds computation into the way it makes things so this little thing here polymerase is essentially a supercomputer designed for replicating dna and the ribosome here is another little computer that helps in the translation of the proteins i thought about this in the sense that it 's great to build in biological materials but can we do similar things can we get self-replicating-type behavior can we get complex 3d structure automatically assembling in inorganic systems because there are some advantages to inorganic systems like higher speed semiconductors etc so this is some of my work on how do you do an autonomously self-replicating system and this is sort of babbage 's revenge these are little mechanical computers these are five-state state machines so that 's about three light switches lined up in a neutral state they wo n't bind at all now if i make a string of these a bit string they will be able to replicate so we start with white blue blue white that encodes ; that will now copy from one comes two and then from two comes three and so you 've got this sort of replicating system it was work actually by lionel penrose father of roger penrose the tiles guy he did a lot of this work in the '60s and so a lot of this logic theory lay fallow as we went down the digital computer revolution but it 's now coming back so now i 'm going to show you the hands-free autonomous self-replication so we 've tracked in the video the input string which was green green yellow yellow green we set them off on this air hockey table you know high science uses air hockey tables -- -- and if you watch this thing long enough you get dizzy but what you 're actually seeing is copies of that original string emerging from the parts bin that you have here so we 've got autonomous replication of bit strings so why would you want to replicate bit strings well it turns out biology has this other very interesting meme that you can take a linear string which is a convenient thing to copy and you can fold that into an arbitrarily complex 3d structure so i was trying to you know take the engineer 's version : can we build a mechanical system in inorganic materials that will do the same thing so what i 'm showing you here is that we can make a 2d shape -- the b -- assemble from a string of components that follow extremely simple rules and the whole point of going with the extremely simple rules here and the incredibly simple state machines in the previous design was that you do n't need digital logic to do computation and that way you can scale things much smaller than microchips so you can literally use these as the tiny components in the assembly process so neil gershenfeld showed you this video on wednesday i believe but i 'll show you again this is literally the colored sequence of those tiles each different color has a different magnetic polarity and the sequence is uniquely specifying the structure that is coming out now hopefully those of you who know anything about graph theory can look at that and that will satisfy you that that can also do arbitrary 3d structure and in fact you know i can now take a dog carve it up and then reassemble it so it 's a linear string that will fold from a sequence and now i can actually define that three-dimensional object as a sequence of bits so you know it 's a pretty interesting world when you start looking at the world a little bit differently and the universe is now a compiler and so i 'm thinking about you know what are the programs for programming the physical universe and how do we think about materials and structure sort of as an information and computation problem not just where you attach a micro-controller to the end point but that the structure and the mechanisms are the logic are the computers having totally absorbed this philosophy i started looking at a lot of problems a little differently with the universe as a computer you can look at this droplet of water as having performed the computations you set a couple of boundary conditions like gravity the surface tension density etc. and then you press " execute " and magically the universe produces you a perfect ball lens so this actually applied to the problem of -- so there 's a half a billion to a billion people in the world do n't have access to cheap eyeglasses so can you make a machine that could make any prescription lens very quickly on site this is a machine where you literally define a boundary condition if it 's circular you make a spherical lens if it 's elliptical you can make an astigmatic lens you then put a membrane on that and you apply pressure -- so that 's part of the extra program and literally with only those two inputs -- so the shape of your boundary condition and the pressure -- you can define an infinite number of lenses that cover the range of human refractive error from minus 12 to plus eight diopters up to four diopters of cylinder and then literally you now pour on a monomer you know i 'll do a julia childs here this is three minutes of uv light and you reverse the pressure on your membrane once you 've cooked it pop it out i 've seen this video but i still do n't know if it 's going to end right so you reverse this this is a very old movie so with the new prototypes actually both surfaces are flexible but this will show you the point now you 've finished the lens you literally pop it out that 's next year 's yves klein you know eyeglasses shape and you can see that that has a mild prescription of about minus two diopters and as i rotate it against this side shot you 'll see that that has cylinder and that was programmed in -- literally into the physics of the system so this sort of thinking about structure as computation and structure as information leads to other things like this this is something that my people at squid labs are working on at the moment called " electronic rope " so literally you think about a rope it has very complex structure in the weave and under no load it 's one structure under a different load it 's a different structure and you can actually exploit that by putting in a very small number of conducting fibers to actually make it a sensor so this is now a rope that knows the load on the rope at any particular point in the rope just by thinking about the physics of the world materials as the computer you can start to do things like this i 'm going to segue a little here i guess i 'm just going to casually tell you the types of things that i think about with this one thing i 'm really interested about this right now is how if you 're really taking this view of the universe as a computer how do we make things in a very general sense and how might we share the way we make things in a general sense the same way you share open source hardware and a lot of talks here have espoused the benefits of having lots of people look at problems share the information and work on those things together so a convenient thing about being a human is you move in linear time and unless lisa randall changes that we 'll continue to move in linear time so that means anything you do or anything you make you produce a sequence of steps -- and i think lego in the '70s nailed this and they did it most elegantly but they can show you how to build things in sequence so i 'm thinking about how can we generalize the way we make all sorts of things so you end up with this sort of guy right and i think this applies across a very broad -- sort of a lot of concepts you know cameron sinclair yesterday said " how do i get everyone to collaborate on design globally to do housing for humanity " and if you 've seen amy smith she talks about how you get students at mit to work with communities in haiti and i think we have to sort of redefine and rethink how we define structure and materials and assembly things so that we can really share the information on how you do those things in a more profound way and build on each other 's source code for structure i do n't know exactly how to do this yet but you know it 's something being actively thought about so you know that leads to questions like is this a compiler is this a sub-routine interesting things like that maybe i 'm getting a little too abstract but you know this is the sort of -- returning to our comic characters -- this is sort of the universe or a different universe view that i think is going to be very prevalent in the future -- from biotech to materials assembly it was great to hear bill joy they 're starting to invest in materials science but these are the new things in materials science how do we put real information and real structure into new ideas and see the world in a different way and it 's not going to be binary code that defines the computers of the universe -- it 's sort of an analog computer but it 's definitely an interesting new worldview i 've gone too far so that sounds like it 's it i 've probably got a couple of minutes of questions or i can show -- i think they also said that i do extreme stuff in the introduction so i may have to explain that so maybe i 'll do that with this short video so this is actually a 3,000-square-foot kite which also happens to be a minimal energy surface so returning to the droplet again thinking about the universe in a new way this is a kite designed by a guy called dave kulp and why do you want a 3,000-square-foot kite so that 's a kite the size of your house and so you want that to tow boats very fast so i 've been working on this a little also with a couple of other guys but you know this is another way to look at the -- if you abstract again this is a structure that is defined by the physics of the universe you could just hang it as a bed sheet but again the computation of all the physics gives you the aerodynamic shape and so you can actually sort of almost double your boat speed with systems like that so that 's sort of another interesting aspect of the future i hope you 'll understand my english in the mornings it is terrible and the afternoon is worst during many years i made some speeches starting with this saying : " city is not a problem it 's a solution " and more and more i 'm convinced that it 's not only a solution for a country but it 's a solution for the problem of climate change but we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities i 'm working in cities for almost 40 years and where every mayor is trying to tell me his city is so big or the other mayors say " we do n't have financial resources " i would like to say from the experience i had : every city in the world can be improved in less than three years there 's no matter of scale it 's not a question of scale it 's not a question of financial resources every problem in a city has to have its own equation of co-responsibility and also a design so to start i want to introduce some characters from a book i made for teenagers the best example of quality of life is the turtle because the turtle is an example of living and working together and when you realize that the casque of the turtle looks like an urban tessitura and can we imagine if we cut the casque of the turtle how sad she 's going to be and that 's what we 're doing in our cities : living here working here having leisure here and most of the people are leaving the city and living outside of the city so the other character is otto the automobile he is invited for a party -- he never wants to leave the chairs are on the tables and still drinking and he drinks a lot and he coughs a lot very egotistical : he carries only one or two people and he asks always for more infrastructure freeways he 's a very demanding person and on the other hand accordion the friendly bus he carries 300 people -- 275 in sweden ; 300 brazilians speaking about the design : every city has its own design curitiba my city : three million in the metropolitan area 1,800,000 people in the city itself curitiba rio : it 's like two birds kissing themselves oaxaca san francisco -- it 's very easy : market street van ness and the waterfront and every city has its own design but to make it happen sometimes you have to propose a scenario and to propose a design -- an idea that everyone or the large majority will help you to make it happen and that 's the structure of the city of curitiba and it 's an example of living and working together and this is where we have more density ; it 's where we have more public transport so this system started in '74 we started with 25,000 passengers a day now it 's 2,200,000 passengers a day and it took 25 years until another city â€¦ which is bogota and they did a very good job and now there 's 83 cities all over the world that they are doing what they call the brt of curitiba and one thing : it 's important not for only your own city ; every city besides its normal problems they have a very important role in being with the whole humanity that means mostly two main issues -- mobility and sustainability -- are becoming very important for the cities and this is an articulated bus double-articulated and we are very close to my house you can come when you are in curitiba and have a coffee there and that 's the evolution of the system what in the design that made the difference is the boarding tubes : the boarding tube gives to the bus the same performance as a subway that 's why i 'm trying to say it 's like metro-nizing the bus this is the design of the bus and you can pay before entering the bus you 're boarding and for handicapped they can use this as a normal system what i 'm trying to say is the major contribution on carbon emissions are from the cars -- more than 50 percent -- so when we depend only on cars it 's â€¦ -- that 's why when we 're talking about sustainability it 's not enough green buildings it 's not enough a new materials it 's not enough new sources of energy it 's the concept of the city the design of the city that 's also important too and also how to teach the children i 'll speak on this later on our idea of mobility is trying to make the connections between all the systems we started in '83 proposing for the city of rio how to connect the subway with the bus the subway was against of course and 23 years after they called us to develop -- we 're developing this idea and you can understand how different it 's going to be the image of rio with the system -- one-minute frequency and it 's not shanghai it 's not being colored during the day only at night it will look this way and before you say it 's a norman foster design we designed this in '83 and this is the model how it 's going to work so it 's the same system ; the vehicle is different and that 's the model what i 'm trying to say is i 'm not trying to prove which system of transport is better i 'm trying to say we have to combine all the systems and with one condition : never -- if you have a subway if you have surface systems if you have any kind of system -- never compete in the same space and coming back to the car i always used to say that the car is like your mother-in-law : you have to have good relationship with her but she can not command your life so when the only woman in your life is your mother-in-law you have a problem so all the ideas about how to transform through design -- old quarries and open universities and botanic garden -- all of it 's related to how we teach the children and the children we teach during six months how to separate their garbage and after the children teach their parents and now we have 70 percent -- since 20 years it 's the highest rate of separation of garbage in the world seven zero so teach the children i would like to say if we want to have a sustainable world we have to work with everything what 's said but do n't forget the cities and the children i 'm working in a museum and also a multi-use city because you can not have empty places during 18 hours a day you should have always a structure of living and working together try to understand the sectors in the city that could play different roles during the 24 hours another issue is a city 's like our family portrait we do n't rip our family portrait even if we do n't like the nose of our uncle because this portrait is you and these are the references that we have in any city this is the main pedestrian mall ; we did it in 72 hours yes you have to be fast and these are the references from our ethnic contribution this is the italian portal the ukrainian park the polish park the japanese square the german park all of a sudden the soviet union they split and since we have people from uzbekistan kazakhstan tajikistan [ unclear ] we have to stop the program do n't forget : creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget if you cut two zeros it 's much better and this is the wire opera theater we did it in two months parks -- old quarries that they were transformed into parks quarries once made the nature and sometimes we took this and we transformed and every part can be transformed ; every frog can be transformed in a prince so in a city you have to work fast planning takes time and i 'm proposing urban acupuncture that means me with some focal ideas to help the normal process of planning and this is an acupuncture note -- or i.m pei 's some small ones can make the city better the smallest park in new york the most beautiful : 32 meters so i want just to end saying that you can always propose new materials -- new sustainable materials -- but keep in mind that we have to work fast to the end because we do n't have the whole time to plan and i think creativity innovation is starting and we can not have all the answers so when you start -- and we can not be so prepotent on having all the answers -- it 's important starting and having the contribution from people and they could teach you if you 're not in the right track at the end i would like if you can help me to sing the sustainable song ok please allow me just two minutes you 're going to make the music and the rhythm â™«

you can do it ! please do it now ! â™« thank you this meeting has really been about a digital revolution but i 'd like to argue that it 's done ; we won we 've had a digital revolution but we do n't need to keep having it and i 'd like to look after that to look what comes after the digital revolution so let me start projecting forward these are some projects i 'm involved in today at mit looking what comes after computers this first one internet zero up here -- this is a web server that has the cost and complexity of an rfid tag -- about a dollar -- that can go in every light bulb and doorknob and this is getting commercialized very quickly and what 's interesting about it is n't the cost ; it 's the way it encodes the internet it uses a kind of a morse code for the internet so you could send it optically ; you can communicate acoustically through a power line through rf it takes the original principle of the internet which is inter-networking computers and now lets devices inter-network that we can take the whole idea that gave birth to the internet and bring it down to the physical world in this internet zero this internet of devices so this is the next step from there to here and this is getting commercialized today a step after that is a project on fungible computers fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded so half as much grain is half as much useful but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer and we 've been trying to make computers that work that way so what you see in the background is a prototype this was from a thesis of a student bill butow now at intel who wondered why instead of making bigger and bigger chips you do n't make small chips put them in a viscous medium and pour out computing by the pound or by the square inch and that 's what you see here on the left was postscript being rendered by a conventional computer ; on the right is postscript being rendered from the first prototype we made but there 's no frame buffer io processor any of that stuff -- it 's just this material unlike this screen where the dots are placed carefully this is a raw material if you add twice as much of it you have twice as much display if you shoot a gun through the middle nothing happens if you need more resource you just apply more computer so that 's the step after this -- of computing as a raw material that 's still conventional bits the step after that is -- this is an earlier prototype in the lab ; this is high-speed video slowed down now integrating chemistry in computation where the bits are bubbles this is showing making bits this is showing -- once again slowed down so you can see it bits interacting to do logic and multiplexing and de-multiplexing so now we can compute that the output arranges material as well as information and ultimately these are some slides from an early project i did computing where the bits are stored quantum-mechanically in the nuclei of atoms so programs rearrange the nuclear structure of molecules all of these are in the lab pushing further and further and further not as metaphor but literally integrating bits and atoms and they lead to the following recognition we all know we 've had a digital revolution but what is that well shannon took us in the '40s from here to here : from a telephone being a speaker wire that degraded with distance to the internet and he proved the first threshold theorem that shows if you add information and remove it to a signal you can compute perfectly with an imperfect device and that 's when we got the internet von neumann in the '50s did the same thing for computing ; he showed you can have an unreliable computer but restore its state to make it perfect this was the last great analog computer at mit : a differential analyzer and the more you ran it the worse the answer got after von neumann we have the pentium where the billionth transistor is as reliable as the first one but all our fabrication is down in this lower left corner a state-of-the-art airplane factory rotating metal wax at fixed metal or you maybe melt some plastic a 10-billion-dollar chip fab uses a process a village artisan would recognize -- you spread stuff around and bake it all the intelligence is external to the system ; the materials do n't have information yesterday you heard about molecular biology which fundamentally computes to build it 's an information processing system we 've had digital revolutions in communication and computation but precisely the same idea precisely the same math shannon and von neuman did has n't yet come out to the physical world so inspired by that colleagues in this program -- the center for bits and atoms at mit -- which is a group of people like me who never understood the boundary between physical science and computer science i would even go further and say computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science -- -- because the canon -- computer science -- many of them are great but the canon of computer science prematurely froze a model of computation based on technology that was available in 1950 and nature 's a much more powerful computer than that so you 'll hear tomorrow from saul griffith he was one of the first students to emerge from this program we started to figure out how you can compute to fabricate this was just a proof of principle he did of tiles that interact magnetically where you write a code much like protein folding that specifies their structure so there 's no feedback to a tool metrology ; the material itself codes for its structure in just the same ways that protein are fabricated so you can for example do that you can do other things that 's in 2d it works in 3d the video on the upper right -- i wo n't show for time -- shows self-replication templating so something can make something that can make something and we 're doing that now over maybe nine orders of magnitude those ideas have been used to show the best fidelity and direct rate dna to make an organism in functionalizing nanoclusters with peptide tails that code for their assembly -- so much like the magnets but now on nanometer scales laser micro-machining : essentially 3d printers that digitally fabricate functional systems all the way up to building buildings not by having blueprints but having the parts code for the structure of the building so these are early examples in the lab of emerging technologies to digitize fabrication computers that do n't control tools but computers that are tools where the output of a program rearranges atoms as well as bits now to do that -- with your tax dollars thank you -- i bought all these machines we made a modest proposal to the nsf we wanted to be able to make anything on any length scale all in one place because you ca n't segregate digital fabrication by a discipline or a length scale so we put together focused nano beam writers and supersonic water jet cutters and excimer micro-machining systems but i had a problem once i had all these machines i was spending too much time teaching students to use them so i started teaching a class modestly called " how to make almost anything " and that was n't meant to be provocative ; it was just for a few research students but the first day of class looked like this you know hundreds of people came in begging all my life i 've been waiting for this class ; i 'll do anything to do it then they 'd ask can you teach it at mit it seems too useful and then the next -- -- surprising thing was they were n't there to do research they were there because they wanted to make stuff they had no conventional technical background at the end of a semester they integrated their skills i 'll show an old video kelly was a sculptor and this is what she did with her semester project : kelly : hi i 'm kelly and this is my scream buddy do you ever find yourself in a situation where you really have to scream but you ca n't because you 're at work or you 're in a classroom or you 're watching your children or you 're in any number of situations where it 's just not permitted well scream buddy is a portable space for screaming when a user screams into scream buddy their scream is silenced it is also recorded for later release where when and how the user chooses so einstein would like this this student made a web browser for parrots -- lets parrots surf the net and talk to other parrots this student 's made an alarm clock you wrestle to prove you 're awake ; this is one that defends -- a dress that defends your personal space this is n't technology for communication ; it 's technology to prevent it this is a device that lets you see your music this is a student who made a machine that makes machines and he made it by making lego bricks that do the computing just year after year -- and i finally realized the students were showing the killer app of personal fabrication is products for a market of one person you do n't need this for what you can get in wal-mart ; you need this for what makes you unique ken olsen famously said nobody needs a computer in the home but you do n't use it for inventory and payroll ; dec is now twice bankrupt you do n't need personal fabrication in the home to buy what you can buy because you can buy it you need it for what makes you unique just like personalization so with that in turn 20 million dollars today does this ; 20 years from now we 'll make star trek replicators that make anything the students hijacked all the machines i bought to do personal fabrication today when you spend that much of your money there 's a government requirement to do outreach which often means classes at a local school a website -- stuff that 's just not that exciting so i made a deal with my nsf program managers that instead of talking about it i 'd give people the tools this was n't meant to be provocative or important but we put together these fab labs it 's about 20,000 dollars in equipment that approximate both what the 20 million dollars does and where it 's going a laser cutter to do press-fit assembly with 3d from 2d a sign cutter to plot in copper to do electromagnetics a micron scale numerically-controlled milling machine for precise structures programming tools for less than a dollar 100-nanosecond microcontrollers it lets you work from microns and microseconds on up and they exploded around the world this was n't scheduled but they went from inner-city boston to pobal in india to secondi-takoradi on ghana 's coast to soshanguve in a township in south africa to the far north of norway uncovering or helping uncover for all the attention to the digital divide we would find unused computers in all these places a farmer in a rural village -- a kid needs to measure and modify the world not just get information about it on a screen that there 's really a fabrication and an instrumentation divide bigger than the digital divide and the way you close it is not it for the masses but it development for the masses so in place after place we saw this same progression : that we 'd open one of these fab labs where we did n't -- this is too crazy to think of we did n't think this up that we would get pulled to these places ; we 'd open it the first step was just empowerment you can see it in their face just this joy of i can do it this is a girl in inner-city boston who had just done a high-tech on-demand craft sale in the inner city community center it goes on from there to serious hands-on technical education informally out of schools in ghana we had set up one of these labs we designed a network sensor and kids would show up and refuse to leave the lab there was a girl who insisted we stay late at night -- : kids : i love the fab lab -- her first night in the lab because she was going to make the sensor so she insisted on fabbing the board learning how to stuff it learning how to program it she did n't really know what she was doing or why she was doing it but she knew she just had to do it there was something electric about it this is late at you know 11 o'clock at night and i think i was the only person surprised when what she built worked the first time and i 've shown this to engineers at big companies and they say they ca n't do this any one thing she 's doing they can do better but it 's distributed over many people and many sites and they ca n't do in an afternoon what this little girl in rural ghana is doing : girl : my name is valentina kofi ; i am eight years old i made a stacking board and again that was just for the joy of it then these labs started doing serious problem solving -- instrumentation for agriculture in india steam turbines for energy conversion in ghana high-gain antennas in thin client computers and then in turn businesses started to grow like making these antennas and finally the lab started doing invention we 're learning more from them than we 're giving them i was showing my kids in a fab lab how to use it they invented a way to do a construction kit out of a cardboard box -- which as you see up there that 's becoming a business -- but their design was better than saul 's design at mit so there 's now three students at mit doing their theses on scaling the work of eight-year-old children because they had better designs real invention is happening in these labs and i still kept -- so in the last year i 've been spending time with heads of state and generals and tribal chiefs who all want this and i keep saying but this is n't the real thing wait like 20 years and then we 'll be done and i finally got what 's been going on this is kernigan and ritchie inventing unix on a pdp pdps came between mainframes and minicomputers they were tens of thousands of dollars hard to use but they brought computing down to work groups and everything we do today happened there these fab labs are the cost and complexity of a pdp the projection of digital fabrication is n't a projection for the future ; we are now in the pdp era we talked in hushed tones about the great discoveries then it was very chaotic it was n't sort of clear what was going on in the same sense we are now today in the minicomputer era of digital fabrication the only problem with that is it breaks everybody 's boundaries in dc i go to every agency that wants to talk you know ; in the bay area i go to every organization you can think of -- they all want to talk about it but it breaks their organizational boundaries in fact it 's illegal for them in many cases to equip ordinary people to create rather than consume technology and that problem is so severe that the ultimate invention coming from this community surprised me : it 's the social engineering that the lab in far north of norway -- this is so far north its satellite dishes look at the ground rather than the sky because that 's where the satellites are -- the lab outgrew the little barn that it was in it was there because they wanted to find animals in the mountains but it outgrew it so they built this extraordinary village for the lab this is n't a university ; it 's not a company it 's essentially a village for invention ; it 's a village for the outliers in society and those have been growing up around these fab labs all around the world so this program has split into an ngo foundation a fab foundation to support the scaling a micro vc fund the person who runs it nicely describes it as " machines that make machines need businesses that make businesses : " it 's a cross between micro-finance and vc to do fan-out and then the research partnerships back at mit for what 's making it possible so i 'd like to leave you with two thoughts there 's been a sea change in aid from top-down mega-projects to bottom-up grassroots micro-finance investing in the roots so that everybody 's got that that 's what works but we still look at technology as top-down mega-projects computing communication energy for the rest of the planet are these top-down mega-projects if this room full of heroes is just clever enough you can solve the problems the message coming from the fab labs is that the other five billion people on the planet are n't just technical sinks ; they 're sources the real opportunity is to harness the inventive power of the world to locally design and produce solutions to local problems i thought that 's the projection 20 years hence into the future but it 's where we are today it breaks every organizational boundary we can think of the hardest thing at this point is the social engineering and the organizational engineering but it 's here today and finally any talk like this on the future of computing is required to show moore 's law but my favorite version -- this is gordon moore 's original one from his original paper -- and what 's happened is year after year after year we 've scaled and we 've scaled and we 've scaled and we 've scaled and we 've scaled and we 've scaled and we 've scaled and we 've scaled and there 's this looming bug of what 's going to happen at the end of moore 's law ; this ultimate bug is coming but we 're coming to appreciate is the transition from 2d to 3d from programming bits to programming atoms turns the ends of moore 's law scaling from the ultimate bug to the ultimate feature so we 're just at the edge of this digital revolution in fabrication where the output of computation programs the physical world so together these two projects answer questions i had n't asked carefully the class at mit shows the killer app for personal fabrication in the developed world is technology for a market of one : personal expression in technology that touches a passion unlike anything i 've seen in technology for a very long time and the killer app for the rest of the planet is the instrumentation and the fabrication divide : people locally developing solutions to local problems thank you when you think about resilience and technology it 's actually much easier you 're going to see some other speakers today i already know who are going to talk about breaking-bones stuff and of course with technology it never is so it 's very easy comparatively speaking to be resilient i think that if we look at what happened on the internet with such an incredible last half a dozen years that it 's hard to even get the right analogy for it a lot of how we decide how we 're supposed to react to things and what we 're supposed to expect about the future depends on how we bucket things and how we categorize them and so i think the tempting analogy for the boom-bust that we just went through with the internet is a gold rush it 's easy to think of this analogy as very different from some of the other things you might pick for one thing both were very real in 1849 in that gold rush they took over $ 700 million worth of gold out of california it was very real the internet was also very real this is a real way for humans to communicate with each other it 's a big deal huge boom huge boom huge bust huge bust you keep going and both things are lots of hype i do n't have to remind you of all the hype that was involved with the internet -- like getrich.com but you had the same thing with the gold rush " gold gold gold " sixty-eight rich men on the steamer portland stacks of yellow metal some have 5,000 many have more a few bring out 100,000 dollars each people would get very excited about this when they read these articles " the eldorado of the united states of america : the discovery of inexhaustible gold mines in california " and the parallels between the gold rush and the internet rush continue very strongly so many people left what they were doing and what would happen is -- and the gold rush went on for years people on the east coast in 1849 when they first started to get the news they thought " ah this is n't real " but they keep hearing about people getting rich and then in 1850 they still hear that and they think it 's not real by about 1852 they 're thinking " am i the stupidest person on earth by not rushing to california " and they start to decide they are these are community affairs by the way local communities on the east coast would get together and whole teams of 10 20 people would caravan across the united states and they would form companies these were typically not solitary efforts but no matter what if you were a lawyer or a banker people dropped what they were doing no matter what skill set they had to go pan for gold this guy on the left dr. richard beverley cole he lived in philadelphia and he took the panama route they would take a ship down to panama across the isthmus and then take another ship north this guy dr. toland went by covered wagon to california this has its parallels too doctors leaving their practices these are both very successful -- a physician in one case a surgeon in the other same thing happened on the internet you get drkoop.com in the gold rush people literally jumped ship the san francisco harbor was clogged with 600 ships at the peak because the ships would get there and the crews would abandon to go search for gold so there were literally 600 captains and 600 ships they turned the ships into hotels because they could n't sail them anywhere you had dotcom fever and you had gold fever and you saw some of the excesses that the dotcom fever created and the same thing happened the fort in san francisco at the time had about 1,300 soldiers half of them deserted to go look for gold and they would n't let the other half out to go look for the first half because they were afraid they would n't come back and one of the soldiers wrote home and this is the sentence that he put : " the struggle between right and six dollars a month and wrong and 75 dollars a day is a rather severe one " they had bad burn rate in the gold rush a very bad burn rate this is actually from the klondike gold rush this is the white pass trail they loaded up their mules and their horses and they did n't plan right and they did n't know how far they would really have to go and they overloaded the horses with hundreds and hundreds of pounds of stuff in fact it was so bad that most of the horses died before they could get where they were going it got renamed the " dead horse trail " and the canadian minister of the interior wrote this at the time : " thousands of pack horses lie dead along the way sometimes in bunches under the cliffs with pack saddles and packs where they 've fallen from the rock above sometimes in tangled masses filling the mud holes and furnishing the only footing for our poor pack animals on the march often i regret to say exhausted but still alive a fact we were unaware of until after the miserable wretches turned beneath the hooves of our cavalcade the eyeless sockets of the pack animals everywhere account for the myriads of ravens along the road the inhumanity which this trail has been witness to the heartbreak and suffering which so many have undergone can not be imagined they certainly can not be described " and you know without the smell that would have accompanied that we had the same thing on the internet : very bad burn rate calculations i 'll just play one of these and you 'll remember it this is a commercial that was played on the super bowl in the year 2000 : bride # 1 : you said you had a large selection of invitations clerk : but we do bride # 2 : then why does she have my invitation announcer : what may be a little thing to some â€¦ bride # 3 : you are mine little man announcer : could be a really big deal to you husband # 1 : is that your wife husband # 2 : not for another 15 minutes announcer : after all it 's your special day ourbeginning.com life 's an event announce it to the world jeff bezos : it 's very difficult to figure out what that ad is for but they spent three and a half million dollars in the 2000 super bowl to air that ad even though at the time they only had a million dollars in annual revenue now here 's where our analogy with the gold rush starts to diverge and i think rather severely and that is in a gold rush when it 's over it 's over here 's this guy : " there are many men in dawson at the present time who feel keenly disappointed they 've come thousands of miles on a perilous trip risked life health and property spent months of the most arduous labor a man can perform and at length with expectations raised to the highest pitch have reached the coveted goal only to discover the fact that there is nothing here for them " and that was of course the very common story because when you take out that last piece of gold -- and they did incredibly quickly i mean if you look at the 1849 gold rush -- the entire american river region within two years -- every stone had been turned and after that only big companies who used more sophisticated mining technologies started to take gold out of there so there 's a much better analogy that allows you to be incredibly optimistic and that analogy is the electric industry and there are a lot of similarities between the internet and the electric industry with the electric industry you actually have to -- one of them is that they 're both sort of thin horizontal enabling layers that go across lots of different industries it 's not a specific thing but electricity is also very very broad so you have to sort of narrow it down you know it can be used as an incredible means of transmitting power it 's an incredible means of coordinating in a very fine-grained way information flows there 's a bunch of things that are interesting about electricity and the part of the electric revolution that i want to focus on is sort of the golden age of appliances the killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb so the light bulb is what wired the world and they were n't thinking about appliances when they wired the world they were really thinking about -- they were n't putting electricity into the home ; they were putting lighting into the home and but it really -- it got the electricity it took a long time this was a huge -- as you would expect -- a huge capital build out all the streets had to be torn up this is work going on down in lower manhattan where they built some of the first electric power generating stations and they 're tearing up all the streets the edison electric company which became edison general electric which became general electric paid for all of this digging up of the streets it was incredibly expensive but that is not the -- and that 's not the part that 's really most similar to the web because remember the web got to stand on top of all this heavy infrastructure that had been put in place because of the long-distance phone network so all of the cabling and all of the heavy infrastructure -- i 'm going back now to sort of the explosive part of the web in 1994 when it was growing 2,300 percent a year how could it grow at 2,300 percent a year in 1994 when people were n't really investing in the web well it was because that heavy infrastructure had already been laid down so the light bulb laid down the heavy infrastructure and then home appliances started coming into being and this was huge the first one was the electric fan -- this was the 1890 electric fan and the appliances the golden age of appliances really lasted -- it depends how you want to measure it -- but it 's anywhere from 40 to 60 years it goes on a long time it starts about 1890 and the electric fan was a big success the electric iron also very big by the way this is the beginning of the asbestos lawsuit there 's asbestos under that handle there this is the first vacuum cleaner the 1905 skinner vacuum from the hoover company and this one weighed 92 pounds and took two people to operate and cost a quarter of a car so it was n't a big seller this was truly truly an early-adopter product -- the 1905 skinner vacuum but three years later by 1908 it weighed 40 pounds now not all these things were highly successful this is the electric tie press which never really did catch on people i guess decided that they would not wrinkle their ties these never really caught on either : the electric shoe warmer and drier never a big seller this came in like six different colors i do n't know why but i thought you know sometimes it 's just not the right time for an invention ; maybe it 's time to give this one another shot so i thought we could build a super bowl ad for this we 'd need the right partner and i thought that really -- i thought that would really work to give that another shot now the toaster was huge because they used to make toast on open fires and it took a lot of time and attention i want to point out one thing this is -- you guys know what this is they had n't invented the electric socket yet so this was -- remember they did n't wire the houses for electricity they wired them for lighting so your -- your appliances would plug in they would -- each room typically had a light bulb socket at the top and you 'd plug it in there in fact if you 've seen the carousel of progress at disney world you 've seen this here are the cables coming up into this light fixture all the appliances plug in there and you would just unscrew your light bulb if you wanted to plug in an appliance the next thing that really was a big big deal was the washing machine now this was an object of much envy and lust everybody wanted one of these electric washing machines on the left-hand side this was the soapy water and there 's a rotor there -- that this motor is spinning and it would clean your clothes this is the clean rinse-water so you 'd take the clothes out of here put them in here and then you 'd run the clothes through this electric ringer and this was a big deal you 'd keep this on your porch it was a little bit messy and kind of a pain and you 'd run a long cord into the house where you could screw it into your light socket and that 's actually kind of an important point in my presentation because they had n't invented the off switch that was to come much later -- the off switch on appliances -- because it did n't make any sense i mean you did n't want this thing clogging up a light socket so you know when you were done with it you unscrewed it that 's what you did you did n't turn it off and as i said before they had n't invented the electric outlet either so the washing machine was a particularly dangerous device and there are -- when you research this there are gruesome descriptions of people getting their hair and clothes caught in these devices and they could n't yank the cord out because it was screwed into a light socket inside the house and there was no off switch so it was n't very good and you might think that that was incredibly stupid of our ancestors to be plugging things into a light socket like this but you know before i get too far into condemning our ancestors i thought i 'd show you : this is my conference room this is a total kludge if you ask me first of all this got installed upside down this light socket -- and so the cord keeps falling out so i taped it in this is supposed -- do n't even get me started but that 's not the worst one this is what it looks like under my desk i took this picture just two days ago so we really have n't progressed that much since 1908 it 's a total total mess and you know we think it 's getting better but have you tried to install 802.11 yourself i challenge you to try it 's very hard i know ph.d.s in computer science -- this process has brought them to tears absolute tears and that 's assuming you already have dsl in your house try to get dsl installed in your house the engineers who do it everyday ca n't do it they have to -- typically they come three times and one friend of mine was telling me a story : not only did they get there and have to wait but then the engineers when they finally did get there for the third time they had to call somebody and they were really happy that the guy had a speakerphone because then they had to wait on hold for an hour to talk to somebody to give them an access code after they got there so we 're not -- we 're pretty kludge-y ourselves by the way dsl is a kludge i mean this is a twisted pair of copper that was never designed for the purpose it 's being put to -- you know it 's the whole thing -- we 're very very primitive and that 's kind of the point because you know resilience -- if you think of it in terms of the gold rush then you 'd be pretty depressed right now because the last nugget of gold would be gone but the good thing is with innovation there is n't a last nugget every new thing creates two new questions and two new opportunities and if you believe that then you believe that where we are -- this is what i think -- i believe that where we are with the incredible kludge -- and i have n't even talked about user interfaces on the web -- but there 's so much kludge so much terrible stuff -- we are at the 1908 hurley washing machine stage with the internet that 's where we are we do n't get our hair caught in it but that 's the level of primitiveness of where we are we 're in 1908 and if you believe that then stuff like this does n't bother you this is 1996 : " all the negatives add up to making the online experience not worth the trouble " 1998 : " amazon.toast " in 1999 : " amazon.bomb " my mom hates this picture she -- but you know if you really do believe that it 's the very very beginning if you believe it 's the 1908 hurley washing machine then you 're incredibly optimistic and i do think that that 's where we are and i do think there 's more innovation ahead of us than there is behind us and in 1917 sears -- i want to get this exactly right this was the advertisement that they ran in 1917 it says : " use your electricity for more than light " and i think that 's where we are we 're very very early thank you very much welcome to 10,000 feet let me explain why we are here and why some of you have a pine cone close to you once upon a time i did a book called " how buildings learn " today 's event you might call " how mountains teach " a little background : for 10 years i 've been trying to figure out how to hack civilization so that we can get long-term thinking to be automatic and common instead of difficult and rare -- or in some cases non-existent it would be helpful if humanity got into the habit of thinking of the now not just as next week or next quarter but you know next 10,000 years and the last 10,000 years -- basically civilization 's story so far so we have the long now foundation in san francisco it 's an incubator for about a dozen projects all having to do with continuity over the long term our core project is a rather ambitious folly -- i suppose a mythic undertaking : to build a 10,000-year clock that can really keep good time for that long a period and the design problems of a project like that are just absolutely delicious go to the clock and what we have here is something many of you saw here three years ago it 's the first working prototype of the clock it 's about nine feet high designed by danny hillis and alexander rose it 's presently in london and is ticking away very deliberately at the science museum there so the design problem for today is going to be how do you house an eventual monumental clock like this so it can really tick save time beautifully for 100 centuries well this was the first solution alexander rose came up with this idea of a spiraloid tower with continuous sloping ramps and it looked like a way to go until you start thinking about what does deep time do to a building well this is what deep time does to a building this is the parthenon it 's only 2,450 years old and look what happened to it here 's a beautiful project they really knew it 'd last forever because they 'd build it out of absolutely huge stones and now it 's a pathetic ruin and no one even knows what it was used for that 's what happens to buildings they 're vulnerable even the most durable and intactable buildings like the pyramids of giza are in bad shape when you look up close they 've been looted inside and out and they 're built to protect things but they do n't protect things so we got to thinking if you ca n't put things safely in a building where can you safely put them we thought ok underground how about underground with a view underground in a place that 's really solid so the obvious answer was we need a mountain you do n't want just any mountain you need absolutely the right mountain if you 're going to have a clock for 10,000 years so here 's an image of the long view of the search problem and we got to thinking for various reasons it ought to be a desert mountain so we got looking in the dry areas of the southwest we looked at mesas in new mexico we were looking at dead volcanoes in arizona then roger kennedy who was the director of the national parks service led us to eastern nevada to america 's newest and oldest national park which is called great basin national park it 's right on the eastern border of nevada it 's the highest range in the state -- over 13,000 feet and you 'll notice that on the left on the left on the west it 's very steep and on the right it 's gentle this place is remote it 's over 200 miles from any major city it 's nowhere near any interstate or railroad and it 's -- the only thing that goes by is what 's called america 's loneliest highway u.s. 50 now inside the yellow line here on the right is -- that 's all national park inside the green line is national forest and then over to the left is bureau of land management land and some private land now as it happened that two-mile-long strip right in the middle this vertical was available because it was private land and thanks to jay walker who was here and mitch kapor who was here who started the process long now was able to get that two-mile-long strip of land and now let 's look at the grand truth of what 's there we 're in pole canyon looking west up the western escarpment of mount washington which is 11,600 feet on top those white cliffs are a dense cambrian limestone that 's a 2,000-foot thick formation and it might be a beautiful place to hide a clock it would be a pilgrimage to get to it ; it would be a serious hike to get up to where the clock is so last june the long now board some staff and some donors and advisors made a two-week expedition to the mountain to explore it and investigate one if it 's the right mountain and two if it 's the right mountain how it might actually work for us now danny hillis sort of framed the problem he has a theory of how the overall clock experience should work it 's what he calls the seven stages of a mythic adventure it starts with the image the image is a picture you have in your mind of the goal at the end of the journey in this case it might well be an image of the clock then there 's the point of embarkation that is the point of transition from ordinary life to being a pilgrim on a quest then -- this is a nice image of it there 's the labyrinth the labyrinth is a concept it 's like a twilight zone it 's a place where it 's difficult where you get disoriented maybe you get scared -- but you have to go through it if you 're going to get to some kind of deep reintegration then there should always be in sight the draw -- a kind of a beacon that draws you on through the labyrinth to finish the process of getting there now brian eno who 's been in the thick of the long now process spent two years making a c.d called " january 7003 " and it 's " bell studies for the clock of the long now " based on -- parts of it are based on an algorithm that danny hillis developed so that a peal of 10 bells makes a different peal every day for 10,000 years the hillis algorithm 10 factorial gives you that number and in fact pretty soon we 'll hear the sound january 7003 there it is ok back to danny 's list number five of the seven is the payoff this is it the climax the goal the main thing that you 're trying to get to and then danny says a really great journey will have a secret payoff something you did n't expect that caps what you did expect then there 's the return you 've got to have a gradual return to the ordinary world so you have time to assimilate what you 've learned and then how about a memento number seven at the end of it there 's something physical a kind of reward that you take away it might be a piece of a core drill of the mountain something that 's just yours how do you study a mountain for the kinds of things we 're talking about this is not a normal building project what do you look for what are the elements that will most affect your ideas and decisions start with borders if you look on the left side of the cliffs here that 's national park that 's sacrosanct -- you ca n't do anything with that to the right of it is national forest there 's possibilities the borders are important other elements were mines weather approaches and elevation and especially trees look at those things up on top there it turns out that mount washington is covered with bristlecone pines they 're the world 's oldest living thing people think they 're just the size of shrubs but that 's not actually true there are trees on that mountain that are 5,000 years old and still living the wood is so solid it 's like stone and it lasts for a long time so when you do tree ring studies of trunks that are on the mountain some of them go back 10,000 years the stone itself is absolutely beautiful sculpted by millennia of very tough winters up there we had tree ring analysts from the university of arizona join us on the expedition now if you guys have a pine cone handy now 's a good time to put it in your hand and feel it especially on the end that 's interesting you 'll find out why it 's called a bristlecone pine a little sensory experience here 's danny hillis in the midst of a bristlecone pine forest on long now land i should say that the age of bristlecones was discovered led by a theory edmund schulman in the 1950s had been studying trees under great stress at timberline and came to the realization that he put in an article in science magazine called " longevity under adversity in conifers " and then based on that principle he started looking around at the various trees at timberline and realized that the bristlecone pines -- he found some in the white mountains that were over 4,000 years old longevity under adversity is a pretty interesting design principle in its own right ok onto the mines the first asking price for the property when we looked at it in 1998 was one billion dollars for 180 acres and a couple of mines because the owner said " there 's one billion dollars of beryllium in that mountain " and we said " wow that 's great listen we 'll counter how about zero and we 're a non-profit foundation you can give us the property and take a hell of a tax deduction all you have to do is prove to the government it 's worth a billion dollars " well a few years went by and there was some kind of back and forth and by and by thanks to mitch and jay we were able to buy the whole property for 140,000 dollars this is one of the mines it does n't have any beryllium in it it 's called the pole adit and it does have tungsten a little bit of tungsten left over that 's the kind of mine it was but it goes a mile-and-a-half in a straight line due east into the range into very interesting territory -- except that as you 'll see when we go inside in a minute we were hoping for limestone but in there is just shale and shale is not quite completely competent rock competent rock is rock that will hold itself up without any shoring the shale would like some shoring and so parts of it are caved in in there that 's ben roberts from -- he 's the bat specialist from the national park but there are many wonders back in there like this weird fungus on some of the collapsed timbers ok here 's another mine that 's up on top of the property and it dates back to 1870 that 's what the property was originally built around -- it was a set of mining claims it was a very productive silver mine in fact it was the highest-operating mine in nevada and it ran year round you can imagine what it was like in the winter at 10,000 feet you may recognize a couple of the miners there there 's jeff bezos on the right and paul saville on the left looking for galena which is the lead-silver thing they did n't find any they both kept their day jobs here 's the last mine it 's called the bonanza adit it 's down in a canyon and alexander rose on the left there worked with a bunch of people from the national park to survey the whole mine it 's a mile deep and they also found four species of bats in there now almost all those mines by the way meet underneath the mountain they do n't quite but it 's something to think about they do n't quite meet let 's go to weather mountains specialize in interesting weather way more interesting than monterey even today and so one tuesday morning last june there we were woke up in the morning -- the mountain was covered with snow that was a great time to go up and visit our weather station which again thanks to mitch kapor we 're building up there and it 's a pretty interesting scene this is on the left there the joyful lady is pat irwin who 's the regional head of the national forest service and they gave us the temporary use permit to be there we want a temporary use permit for the clock eventually -- 10,000-year temporary use permit the weather station 's pretty interesting kurt bollacker and alexander rose designed a radically wireless station it runs on solar and it sends a signal with that antenna and bounces it off of micrometeorite trails in the atmosphere to a place in bozeman montana where the data is taken down and then sent through landlines to san francisco where we put the data in real time up on our website and there you see a week of weather at 9,400 feet on mount washington let 's go to approaches as it happens there are no trails anywhere on mount washington just a few old mining roads like this so you have to bushwhack everywhere but there 's no bears and there 's no poison oak and there 's basically no people because this place has been empty for a long time you can hike for days and not encounter anybody well here 's a potential approach you need to come up the lincoln canyon it 's this beautiful world all of its own surrounded by cliffs and it 's an easy hike to stroll up the canyon bottom until you get to this barrier and it actually presents a problem so you can scratch lincoln canyon as an approach another possible approach is right up the western front of the mountain you can see why we sometimes call it long mountain and from where you 're standing at 6,000 feet in the valley it 's an easy hike up to the mature pinyon and juniper forest through that knoll at the front at 7,600 feet and you can carry right on up through meadows and steepening forest to the high base of the cliffs at 10,500 feet where there 's a bit of a problem now jeff bezos advised us when he left at the end of the expedition " make the clock inaccessible the harder it is to get to the more people will value it " and check -- those are 600-foot vertical walls there so alexander rose wanted to explore this route and he started over here on the left from his pickup truck at 8,900 feet and headed up the mountain now as you gain elevation your iq goes down -- but your emotional affect goes up which is great for having a mythic experience whether you want to or not in fact danny hillis can estimate altitude by how much math he ca n't do in his head now i happened to be on the radio with alexander when he got to this point at the base of the cliffs and he said quote " there 's a hidden notch i think i can get up a ways " now he 's a rock climber but you know he 's our executive director i do n't want him killed i know he 's going to love cliffs i 'm saying " be careful be careful be careful " then he starts going up and the next thing i hear is " i 'm half-way up it 's like climbing stairs i 'm going up 60 degrees it 's a secret passage it 's like something from tolkien " and i 'm going " careful careful please be careful " and then of course the next thing i hear is " i 've made it to the top you can see all of creation from up here " and he dashed across the top of the mountains in fact there he is that 's alexander rose first ascent of the western face to mount washington and a solo ascent at that this discovery changed everything about our sense of these cliffs and what to do with them we realized that we had to name this thing that alexander discovered how about zander 's crevice no so we finally decided on alexander 's siq zander 's siq is named after -- some of you have been to petra there 's this wonderful slot canyon that leads into petra called the siq and so this is the siq and it really is hidden i ca n't find it in this image and i 'm not sure you can only when you get fresh snow can you see just along the rim there and that brings it out now danny and i were up at this same area one day and danny looked over to the right and noticed something halfway up the cliffs which is a kind of a porch or a cliff shelf with bristlecones on it and supposed that people going up to the clock inside the mountain could come out onto that shelf and look down at the view and the people toiling up the mountain could see them these tiny little people up there incredibly halfway up the cliff how did they get there do i have to do that and so that maybe becomes part of the draw and part of the labyrinth you can get another angle on danny 's porch by going around to the south and looking north at the whole formation there and you need to know that danny 's clock is to be kept accurate by a ray of sunshine that perfect noon hitting it every sunny day and the pulse of heat from that sets off a solar trigger which resets the clock to make it perfectly accurate so even with the slowing of the rotation of the earth and so on the clock will keep perfectly good time so here we 're looking from the south look north this is all forest service land if you go up on top of those cliffs that 's some of the long now land in those trees and if you go up there and look back then you 'll get a sense of what the view starts to be like from the top of the mountain that 's the long view that 's 80 miles to the horizon and that 's also timberline and those bristlecones really are shrubs that 's a different place to be it 's 11,400 feet and it 's exquisite now if you go over to the right from this image to looking at the edge of the cliffs it 's 600 foot just about a yard to the left of kurt bollacker 's foot there is a 600-foot drop he 's ambling on over to zander 's siq that 's what it looks like looking down it we should probably put in a rail or something over on the eastern side it 's gentle as you can see and that 's not snow -- that 's what the white limestone looks like you also see there a bighorn sheep their herd was reintroduced from wyoming and they 're doing pretty well but they 've got a bit of trouble this is danny hillis and he 's figuring out a design problem he 's trying to determine if where he is on a bit of long now land would appear from down in the valley to be the actual peak of the mountain because the real peak is hidden around the corner this is what in the infantry we used to call the military crest and as it turned out the answer is yes that is from down below in the valley it does look like the peak and that might be conjured with we gradually realized we have three serious design domains to work on with this one is the experience of the mountain another is the experience in the mountain and the third is the experience from the mountain which is really dominated by the view shed of the spring valley there behind danny and if you look off to the right out there 15 miles across to the schell creek range in the front there are 10 ranches strung right along the base of the mountains using the water from the mountains in fact there are artesian wells where water springs right into the air one of the ranches is called the kirkeby ranch and i 'll take you there for a minute it 's a very nice ranch alfalfa and cattle run by paul and ronnie brenham and it 's pretty idyllic it 's also hard work and most of these ranches are having trouble keeping going this is their view to the west of the schell creek range and if you go out to that line of trees at the far end you 'll see what the valley used to look like this is rocky mountain junipers that have been there for thousands of years and a scheme emerged that long now is looking to see if it might be possible to buy up the whole valley because those 10 ranches with their 17,000 acres dominate a 500 square mile valley with their grazing allotments and so on and there 's a possibility that you could get the whole thing for five million dollars and gradually restore it to its wild condition and somewhere in the process turn it back over to the national park and it would double the size of great basin national park that would be swell ok let 's take one more look at the mountain itself the clock experience should be profound but from the outside it should be invisible now at the base of the high cliffs there 's this natural cave it 's only about 12 feet deep but what if it were deepened from inside you excavated from somewhere came up from inside and deepened it and then you could have an entrance which was very rough and narrow as you first went in that gradually becomes more refined and then actually quite exquisite and this stone takes a perfect polish you 'd have a polished set of passages and chambers in there eventually leading to the 10,000 year clock and it 's not a mine this would be a nuanced evocation of the basic structure of the mountain and you would be appreciating it as much from inside as you do from outside this is architecture not made by building but by what you very carefully take away so that 's what the mountain taught us most of the amazingness of the clock we can borrow from the amazingness of the mountain all we have to do is highlight its spectacular features and blend in with them it 's not a clock in a mountain -- it 's a mountain clock now the tewa indians in the southwest have a saying for what you need to do when you want to think long term about anything they say " pin peya obe " -- welcome to the mountain thank you i have like a thing about sleeping i do n't sleep that much and i 've come to this thing about like not sleeping much as being a great virtue after years of kind of battling it as being a terrible detriment or something and now i really like sort of sitting up you know but for years i 've been sitting up and i think that like my creativity is greatly motivated by this kind of insomnia i lie awake i think thoughts i walk aimlessly sometimes i used to walk more at night i walk during the day and i follow people who i think look interesting and sometimes -- actually once it was on page six in the post that i was cruising this guy like sort of whatever but i was actually just following because he had these really great shoes on and so i was following this guy and i took a picture of his shoes and we thanked each other and just went on our way but i do that all the time as a matter of fact i think a lot of my design ideas come from mistakes and tricks of the eye because i feel like you know there are so many images out there so many clothes out there and the only ones that look interesting to me are the ones that look slightly mistaken of course or very very surprising and often i 'm driving in a taxi and i see a hole in a shirt or something that looks very interesting or pretty or functional in some way that i 'd never seen happen before and so i 'd make the car stop and i 'd get out of the car and walk and see that in fact there was n't a hole but it was a trick of my eye it was a shadow you know or if there was a hole i 'd think like oh damn there was actually someone thought of that thought already someone made that mistake already so i ca n't do it anymore i do n't know where inspiration comes from it does not come for me from research i do n't get necessarily inspired by research as a matter of fact one of the most fun things i 've ever ever done in my whole life was this christmas season at the guggenheim in new york i read " peter and the wolf " with this beautiful band from juilliard and i did like you know the narrator and i read it and i saw this really smart critic who i love this woman joan acocella who 's a friend of mine and she came backstage and she said oh you know isaac did you know that talking about stalinism and talking about you know like the '30s in russia and i said how do i know about stalinism i know about a wolf and a bird and you know he ate the bird and then in the end you hear you know you hear the bird squeaking or something you know so i do n't really know that i do n't really -- actually i do my own kind of research you know if i 'm commissioned to do the costumes for an 18th-century opera or something like that i will do a lot of research because it 's interesting not because it 's what i 'm supposed to do i 'm very very very inspired by movies the color of movies and the way light makes the colors light from behind the projection or light from the projection makes the colors look so impossible and anyway roll this little clip i 'll just show you i sit up at night and i watch movies and i watch women in movies a lot and i think about you know their roles and about how you have to like watch what your daughters look at because i look at the way women are portrayed all the time whether they 're kind of glorified in this way or whether they 're kind of you know ironically glorified or whether they 're you know sort of denigrated or ironically denigrated i go back to color all the time color is something that motivates me a lot it 's rarely color that i find in nature although you know juxtaposed next to artificial color natural color is so beautiful so that 's what i do i study color a lot but for the most part i think like how can i ever make anything that is as beautiful as that image of natalie wood how can i ever make anything as beautiful as greta garbo i mean that 's just not possible you know and so that 's what makes me lie awake at night i guess you know i want to show you -- i 'm also like a big -- i go to astrologers and tarot card readers often and that 's another thing that motivates me a lot people say oh do that an astrologer tells me to do something so i do it when i was about 21 an astrologer told me that i was going to meet the man of my dreams and that his name was going to be eric right so you know for years i would go to bars and sort of anyone i met whose name was eric i was humping immediately or something and there were times when i was actually so desperate i would just you know walk into a room and just go like " eric ! " and anybody who would turn around i would sort of make a beeline for and i had this really interesting tarot reading a long time ago the last card he pulled which was representing my destiny was this guy on like a straw boater with a cane and you know sort of spats and this you know a minstrel singer right i want to show you this clip because i do this kind of crazy thing where i do a cabaret act so actually check this out very embarrassing : thank you we can do anything you ask the name of the show is based on this story that i have to tell you about my mother it 's sort of an excerpt from a quote of hers i was dating this guy right and this has to do with being happy i swear i was dating this guy and it was going on for about a year right and we were getting serious so we decided to invite them all to dinner our parents and we you know sort of introduced them to each other my mother was sort of very sensitive to his mother who it seemed was a little bit skeptical about the whole alternative lifestyle thing you know homosexuality right so my mother was a little offended she turned to her and she said " are you kidding they have the greatest life together they eat out they see shows " they eat out they see shows that 's the name of the show they eat out they -- that 's on my tombstone when i die " he ate out he saw shows " right so in editing these clips i did n't have the audacity to edit a clip of me singing at joe 's pub so you 'll have to like go check it out and come see me or something because it 's mortifying and yet it feels â€¦ i do n't know how to put this i feel as little comfort as possible is a good thing you know and at least you know in my case because if i just do one thing all the time i do n't know i get very very bored i bore very easily and you know i do n't say that i do everything well i just say that i do a lot of things that 's all and i kind of try not to look back you know except i guess that 's what staying up every night is about like looking back and thinking what a fool you made of yourself you know but i guess that 's okay right because if you do many things you get to feel lousy about everything and not just one you know you do n't master feeling lousy about one thing yeah exactly i will show you this next thing speaking of costumes for operas i do work with different choreographers i work with twyla tharp a lot and i work with mark morris a lot who is one of my best friends and i designed three operas with him and the most recent one " king arthur " i 'd been very ingrained in the dance world since i was a teenager i went to performing arts high school where i was an actor and many of my friends were ballet dancers again i do n't know where inspiration comes from i do n't know where it comes from i started making puppets when i was a kid maybe that 's where the whole inspiration thing started from puppets right and then performing arts high school there i was in high school meeting dancers and acting and somehow from there i got interested in design i went to parsons school of design and then i began my career as a designer i do n't really think of myself as a designer i do n't really think of myself necessarily as a fashion designer and frankly i do n't really know what to call myself i think of myself as a â€¦ i do n't know what i think of myself as it 's just that but i must say this whole thing about being slightly bored all the time that is what -- i think that is a very important thing for a fashion designer you always have to be slightly bored with everything and if you 're not you have to pretend to be slightly bored with everything but i am really a little bored with everything i always say to my partner marisa gardini who books everything -- she books everything and she makes everything happen and she makes all the deals and i always tell her that i find myself with a lot of time on the computer bridge program too much time on computer bridge which is you know like that 's so â€¦ somehow like about ten years ago i thought that the most unboring place in the world would be like a t.v studio like for a day show some kind of day talk show because it 's all of these things that i love all kind of in one place and if you ever get bored you can look at another thing and do another thing and talk about it right and so i had this t.v show and that was a very very very big part of my process actually could you roll the clip please this is one of my favorite clips of rosie isaac mizrahi : we 're back on the set hi there rosie o'donnell : hello ben im : look how cute she looks with this just a slick back man : her grandmother says " delish ! " im : ah wow delish all right so now where should i position myself i want to stay out of the way i do n't want to be -- okay here we go do you get nervous ashleigh ashleigh : doing what rod : cutting hair a : cutting hair never never i do n't think there was ever a day where i cut hair i was nervous im : you look so cute already by the way rod : you like it all right im : do you have a problem with looking cute you want to look cute rod : of course i want to look cute im : just checking because some people want to look you know aggressively ugly rod : no not me no im : you read about all these people who have a lot of money and they have kids and the kids always end up somehow like really messed up you know what i mean and there 's got to be some way to do that rosie because just because if you 're fabulously rich and fabulously famous does that mean you should n't have kids because you know they 're going to end up getting messed up rod : no but it means that your priority has to be their well-being first i think but you have to make the decision for yourself my kids are seven who the hell knows they 're going to be like 14 and in rehab and they 're going to be playing this clip : " i 'm such a good mother " my god this is the shortest i 've ever had im : it looks good yeah a : i was going to ask you has your hair ever been -- rod : no ! it 's all right -- go crazy im : i feel like it needs to be a little closer down here a : oh no we 're just staging rod : we 're just staging it im : are you freaking out you look so cute rod : no i love it it 's the new me im : oh it 's so fabulous ! rod : flock of rosie wooo ! im : so by the way of all the most unboring things in the world right i mean like making someone who 's already cute look terrible like that that is not boring that is nothing if it 's not boring actually i read this great quote the other day which was " style makes you feel great because it takes your mind off the fact that you 're going to die " right and then i realized that was on my website and then it said like you know the quote was attributed to me and i thought oh i said something you know in an interview i forgot that i said that but it 's really true i want to show you this last clip because it 's going to be my last goodbye i 'll tell you that i cook a lot also i love to cook and i often look at things as though they 're food like i say oh you know would you serve a rotten chicken then how could you serve you know a beat up old dress or something how could you show a beat up old dress i always relate things to kitchen-ry and so i think that 's what it all boils down to everything boils down to that so check this out this is what i 've been doing because i think it 's the most fun thing in the world it 's like this website it 's got a lot of different things on it it 's a polymathematical website we actually shoot segments like t.v show segments and it 's kind of my favorite thing in the world and it just began like in the beginning of february so who knows and again i do n't say it 's good i just think it 's not boring right and here is the last bit im : i have to tell you i make buttermilk pancakes or buttermilk waffles all the time chef : do you im : yeah but i can never find buttermilk ever chef : oh im : you ca n't find buttermilk at citarella ; you ca n't find buttermilk chef : you ca n't im : it 's always low-fat buttermilk chef : no but that 's all it is im : is that all it is chef : oh you do n't know let me tell you something let me tell you something interesting im : you know what stop laughing it 's not funny just because i do n't know that whole -- that there 's no such thing as whole buttermilk sorry what chef : well here 's the deal let me tell you the deal in the old days when they used to make butter you know how you make butter im : churns chef : for cream im : yeah exactly chef : so you take heavy high-fat milk which is cream and you churn it until it separates into these curds and water the liquid is actually that clear liquid if you 've ever overbeaten your whipped cream it 's actually buttermilk and that 's what it was in the early days and that 's what people used for baking and all sorts of things now the buttermilk that you get is actually low-fat or skim milk im : excuse me i did n't know all right chef : the reason he thought that is because buttermilk is so wonderfully thick and delicious im : yeah it is exactly so who would think that it was low-fat well that 's it thank you very much happy ted it 's so wonderful here i love it i love it i love it thanks bye three years ago i got a phone call based on an earlier film i had made with an offer to embed the new hampshire national guard my idea -- and literally i woke up in the middle of the night and we 've all have those moments you know you go to sleep -- i was excited with this phone call i was thinking i just finished making another film about world war ii vets and i realized i 'd gotten to know their stories and i realized this was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tell a warrior 's story as it unfolded so i went to bed that night pretty excited not sure of all the details but excited it was n't at four in the morning but it was closer to midnight woke straight up wide-awake as could be and i had this idea : what if i could in effect virtually embed and create a permeable relationship with the soldiers to tell the story from the inside out versus the outside in so i called back major heilshorn who 's the public affairs officer of the new hampshire national guard and he knew me so i was like " greg " he 's like " yes deborah " told him my idea and you know he is one of the bravest men in the world as is general blair who in the end gave me permission to try this experiment within 10 days i was down at fort dix he gave me my pick of units i picked one unit -- charlie company third of the 172nd they 're mountain infantry -- for two reasons one they 're infantry number two they were going to be based at lsa anaconda so i knew they would have internet access the caveat for my access was i had to get the soldiers to volunteer this was a big thing that i think when major h told me i was n't really totally gathering what that would mean so what that meant was when i went down to fort dix i had to hop out in front of 180 guys and tell them of my vision you can imagine the hailstorm of questions i got the opening one was " what the fuck do you know about the national guard " i started with the 1607 massachusetts bay colony pequot indian wars gave them about a nine minute response and there we went so i 'd like to show the clip of the film it 's our trailer because i know obviously you guys are busy many of you may not have had a chance to see it so i want to show the trailer and then i 'm going to take apart one scene in detail if we could roll stephen pink : this is sergeant stephen pink michael moriarty : specialist michael moriarty zack bazzi : do i really want to go probably not soldier : we 're not supposed to talk to the media sp : i 'm not the media dammit ! mm : the day is here life will change voice : the real deal man ! narrator : you ready soldier : bring it on ! narrator : you ready voice 2 : iraq here we come ! zb : every soldier eventually wants to go in combat it 's natural instinct sp : if you let fear get to you then you 're not going to be doing your job mm : every single time you go out there there 's attacks it 's unbelievable zb : hey nestor your ass crack is right in my face soldiers : iv ! are we on fire iv ! man down ! man down ! mm : keep going brother you wan na play michael moriarty 's wife : it 's really hard for him to not have his dad mm : this little kid is in the middle of a war zone stephen pink 's girlfriend : in the beginning he 's like " write something dirty ! " george w. bush : the world 's newest democracy mm : they 're shooting at me sp : you do n't put 150,000 troops in there and say we 're there to create democracy soldier : we 've got a drive through window at burger king now sp : we 're here to create money mm : i support george bush we 're not there for the oil jon baril : the worst thing in my life sp : baril do n't look at it bud michael moriarty 's wife : he 's not the same person anymore mm : i will not go back kevin shangraw : the iraqi people are who we are there to help -- and we just killed one soldiers : sergeant smith is down ! sergeant smith is down there they are ! right there ! fire fire ! jb : it 'll be a better country in 20 years 'cause we were there i hope deborah scranton : thank you one of the things i 'd like to talk to you about is having a conversation about something that is difficult to talk about and i 'd like to relate an experience i had here at ted i do n't know how many of you might imagine it but there 's actually a tedster who recently got back from iraq paul come on stand up this is paul anthony he served -- -- with the marines and i want to tell you a little brief story we were one of the lucky ones to get in the class with the sony cameras and the vista software right and we started talking people will see my tag and they 'll see " the war tapes " and then we 'll start talking about war we got in a conversation with some other people in the class and it went on and on i mean we were there for an hour talking and it really highlighted something that i would like to ask you guys to think about and hopefully to help with which is i think a lot of us are very afraid to have conversations about war and about politics and really -- because maybe we 're going to disagree maybe it 's going to get uncomfortable how do we open it up to really be able to have a conversation and you know paul was talking and he then turned to constance and said " you know i would n't have this conversation if she were n't here because i know she has my back " and i want to say i was nervous because i 'm used to doing q & amp ; as i really related to what james was saying yesterday because i 'm behind the camera you know i can answer questions about my movie but for me to come up and talk for 18 minutes is a really long time so i wanted to say paul i 'm happy you 're here because i know you have my back this film was not about the internet but it could not have been made without it the guys ' tapes on average took two weeks to get from iraq to me in the meantime the soldiers -- we would email and im i did n't save all of them because i did n't realize at the beginning that it would be something that i would want to keep track of but there were 3,211 emails and ims and text messages that i was able to save the reason i quantify that is because we really embarked on this as a mutual journey to really get inside of it so i wanted to show you a clip and then i was going tell you a little bit of how it got put together if we could roll the clip sp : today is sport [ unclear ] radio : [ unclear ] christian soldiers sp : we like to give these insurgents a fair chance so what we do we ride with the windows down because you know we obviously have the advantage i 'm just kidding we do n't fucking ride with the goddam windows down it 's not true very unsafe whoa soldier : right there sp : all right let 's get over to that site be advised we 're leaving taji right now we believe that the blast was right outside the gate of taji we 're heading to that location now soldier : that 's a fucking car bomb ! soldier : motherfuckers ! soldiers : get your vest on ! hey get over the fucking -- yeah yeah any one-four elements get to the gate ! sp : sheriff one-six or any one-four elements we need you at the gate of taji right now over soldier : i 'll walk you through it sp : stay low head over to the right get your bag get your bag ! sp : it was mass casualties probably 20 dead at least 20 or 30 wounded iraqis sp : it just looked like you know someone had thrown a quarter through a guy and it was just like -- there was no blood coming from the shrapnel wounds everything was cauterized and it was just like there was a void going through the body this is the scene north they just removed a burnt body or half a body from here i do n't think there was anything left from his abdominal down this is blood and you know you walk and you hear the pieces of skin and that 's it that 's all that 's left i remember giving three ivs bandaging several wounded soldiers sitting in the corner of a sandbag wall shaking and screaming medics who were terrified and could n't perform i later heard that iraqi casualties were not to be treated in taji they can work on the post for pennies but ca n't die there they 've got to die outside if one of those incompetent medical officers told me to stop treatment i would 've slit his throat right there 21:00 hours and it 's just our squad going through today 's events in our heads whether we want to or not news anchor : more violence in iraq twin suicide car bombings killed eight iraqis and wounded dozens more near a coalition base north of baghdad sp : we made the news i feel exploited and proud at the same time i 've lost all faith in the media -- a hapless joke i would much rather laugh at than become a part of i should really thank god for saving my lucky ass i 'll do that then i 'm gon na jerk off because these pages smell like linds and there wo n't be any time for jerking off tomorrow another mission at 06:00 ds : now -- -- thanks when i said earlier to try and tell a story from the inside out versus the outside in -- part of what chris said so eloquently in his introduction -- is this melding it 's a new way of trying to make a documentary when i met the guys and 10 of them agreed to take cameras -- in total 21 ended up filming five soldiers filmed the entire time there are three featured in the film the way i learned about taji was steve pink sent me an email and in it attached a photo of that burned body out at the car and the tone from the email was you know it had been a very bad day obviously and i saw in my im window that mike moriarty was at the base so i pinged mike and i said " mike can you please go get that interview with pink " because the thing that very often is missing is in the military what they call " hot wash " it 's that immediate interview after something immediately happens you know and if you let time go by it kind of softens and smooths the edges and for me i really wanted that so in order to get the intimacy to share that experience with you the guys -- the two most popular mounts -- there was a camera on the turret the gun turret and then on the dashboard of the humvee most of the humvees we ended up mounting two cameras in them so you get to experience that in real time right the interview that you see is the one that mike went and did within 24 hours of that episode happening steve pink reading his journal happened five months after he came home i knew about that journal but it was very very private and you know you earn someone 's trust especially in doc filmmaking through your relationship so it was n't until five months after he was home that he would read that journal now the news footage i put in there to try to show -- you know i think mainstream media tries to do the best they can in the format that they have but the thing that i know you all have heard a lot of times american soldiers saying " why do n't they talk about the good stuff that we do " ok this is a perfect example pink 's squad and another squad spent their entire day outside the wire they did n't have to go outside the wire there were not americans hurt out there they spent their entire day outside the wire trying to save iraqi lives -- the iraqis who work on the post so when you may hear soldiers complaining that 's what they 're talking about you know and i think it 's such an amazing gift that they would share this as a way of bridging and when i talk about that polarity i get at so many different q & amp ; as and people are really opinionated but it seems like people do n't want to hear so much or listen or try to have an exchange and i 'm as fiery as the next person but i really think -- you know different speakers have talked about their concern for the world and my concern is that we have to have these conversations and we have to be able to go into scary places where we may you know we think we know but we just have to leave that little bit of openness to know there 's such a disconnect and for me it 's trying to bridge that disconnect i 'll share one story i get -- i 'm often asked you know for me what have been some of the special moments from having worked on this film and at screenings inevitably -- you know as i 'm sure all of you obviously do speaking stuff -- usually you have people who hang around and want to ask you more questions and usually the first questions are " oh what kind of cameras did you use " or you know these things but there 's always a few guys almost always who are the last ones and i 've learned over time that those are always the soldiers and they wait until pretty much everybody 's gone and for me one of the most profound stories someone shared with me that then became my story was -- for those of you who have n't seen the film and it 's not a spoiler -- it 's very common there are a lot of civilian accidents where people get in front of humvees and they get killed in this film there is a scene where an iraqi woman is killed a soldier came up to me and stood you know really pretty close a foot away from me he 's a big guy and he looked at me and i smiled and then i saw the tears start welling up in his eyes and he was n't going to blink and he said " my gunner was throwing candy " and i knew what he was going to say the gunner was throwing candy they used to throw candy to the kids kids got too close very often and he said " i killed a child and i 'm a father i have children i have n't been able to tell my wife i 'm afraid she 's going to think i 'm a monster " i hugged him of course and i said you know " it 's going to be ok " and he said " i 'm going to bring her to see your film and then i 'm going to tell her " so when i talk about a disconnect it 's not only for maybe those people who do n't know a soldier which there obviously are you know these days it 's not like world war ii where there was a war front and a home front and everybody seemed involved you can go for days here and not feel like there 's a war going on and often i 'll hear people say who maybe know that i did this film and they say " oh you know i 'm against the war but i support the soldiers " and i 've started to ask them " well that 's nice what are you doing are you volunteering at a va you go and see anybody do you if you find out your neighbor 's been do you spend some time not necessarily ask questions but see if they want to talk do you give money to any of the charities " you know obviously like dean kamen 's working on that amazing thing but there 's charities where you can sponsor computers for wounded soldiers i think i challenge us to say -- to operationalize those terms when we say we support someone you know are you a friend to them do you really care and i would just say it 's my hope and i would ask you guys to please you know reach out a hand and really do give them a hug thank you i have a story a story that i would like to share with you and it 's an african story it is a story of hope resilience and glamour there was hollywood then came bollywood today we have nollywood the third-largest film industry in the world in 2006 alone almost 2,000 films were made in nigeria now try to imagine 40 50 films wrapped distributed every week in the streets of lagos nigeria and west africa some estimates put the value of this industry at 250 million dollars it has created thousands if not tens of thousands of jobs and it 's expanding but keep in mind that this was a grassroots movement this is something that happened without foreign investment without government aid and actually it happened against all odds in one of the most difficult moments in nigerian economy the industry is 15 years old and so maybe you 're thinking now why how an italian filmmaker based in boston is so interested in this story and so i think i have to tell you just a few words a few things about my personal life because i think there is a connection my grandfather lived most of his life and is buried in zambia my father also lived most of his adult life in east africa and i was born in zambia even though i left when i was only three years old i really felt that africa was this big part of my life and it really was a place where i learned to walk i think i uttered the first words and my family bought their first home so when we came back to italy and one of the things that i remember the most is my family having this hard time to share stories it seemed that for our neighbors and friends africa was either this exotic place this imaginary land that probably exists only in their imagination or the place of horror famine and so we were always caught in this stereotype and i remember really this desire to talk about africa as a place where we lived and people live and go about their lives and have dreams like we all have so when i read in a newspaper in the business page the story of nollywood i really felt this is an incredible opportunity to tell a story that goes against all these preconceived notions here i can tell a story of africans making movies like i do and actually i felt this was an inspiration for me i have the good fortune of being a filmmaker-in-residence at the center of digital imaging arts at boston university and we really look how digital technology is changing and how young independent filmmakers can make movies at a fraction of the cost so when i proposed the story i really had all the support to make this film and not only had the support i found two wonderful partners in crime in this adventure aimee corrigan a very talented and young photographer and robert caputo a friend and a mentor who is a veteran of national geographic and told me " you know franco in 25 years of covering africa i do n't know if i have come across a story that is so full of hope and so fun " so we went to lagos in october 2005 and we went to lagos to meet bond emeruwa a wonderful talented film director who is with us tonight the plan was to give you a portrait of nollywood of this incredible film industry following bond in his quest to make an action movie that deals with the issue of corruption called " checkpoint " police corruption and he had nine days to make it we thought this was a good story in the meantime we had to cover nollywood and we talked to a lot of filmmakers but i do n't want to create too many expectations i would like to show you six minutes and these are six minutes they really prepared for the ted audience there are several themes from the documentary but they are re-edited and made for you ok so i guess it 's a world premier man : action milverton nwokedi : you cut a nice movie with just 10,000 dollars in nigeria here and you shoot in seven days peace piberesima : we 're doing films for the masses we 're not doing films for the elite and the people in their glass houses they can afford to watch their " robocop " and whatever mahmood ali balogun : i think filmmaking in nigeria for those who work in it is a kind of subsistence filmmaking -- what they do to make a living it 's not the fancy filmmaking where you say oh you want to put all the razzmatazz of hollywood and where you have big budgets here is that you make these films it sells you jump onto the location again to make another film because if you do n't make the next film you 're not going to feed bond emeruwa : so while we 're entertaining we should be able to educate i believe in the power of audiovisuals i mean 90 percent of the population will watch nollywood i think it 's the most viable vehicle right now to pass information across a dedicated cable so if you 're making a movie no matter what your topic is put in a message in there woman : you still have to report the incident he needs proper medical attention pp : i keep trying to explain to people it 's not about the quality at the moment -- the quality is coming i mean there are those films that people are making for quality but the first thing you have to remember about this society is that africa still has people that live on one dollar a day and these are the people that really watch these films sonny mcdon w : nollywood is a fantastic industry that has just been born in this part of the world because nobody believed that nollywood can come out of africa lancelot imasen : but our films they are stories that our people can relate to themselves they are stories about our people for our people and consistently they are glued to their screen whenever they see the story narrator : suspense fun and intrigue it 's the blockbuster comedy you 'll crack your ribs bernard pinayon agbaosi : we have been so deep into the foreign movies it 's all about the foreign movies but we can do something too we can do something something that when the world sees it they say wow this is nigeria man : just arrest yourself sergeant do n't embarrass yourself come on do n't run away come back come back smw : you can now walk the street and see a role model it 's not just what you see in picture you see the person live you see how he talks you see how he lives he influences you really good you know it 's not just what you see in the picture it is not what you hear you know from the western press man : see you bye action saint obi : i was so fascinated you know with those cowboy movies but then when i discovered the situation in my country at that time there was so much corruption for a young man to really make it out here you got to think of some negative things and all that or some kind of vices and i did n't want that you know and i discovered that i could be successful in life as an actor without doing crime without cheating nobody without telling no lies just me and god-given talent man : let 's go ok it 's time to kick some ass cover this it 's your own move it roboger animadu : in big countries when they do the movies they have all these things in place but here we improvise these items like the gunshots like they go here now now you see the gun there but you wo n't see any guns shot we use knock-out kevin books ikeduba : what i 'm scared of is just the explosion will come up in my face woman : that 's why i use enough masking tape the masking tape will hold it wat wait just hold this for me kbi : i 'm just telling her to make sure she places it well so that it wo n't affect my face -- the explosion you know but she 's a professional she knows what she 's doing i 'm trying to protect my face too this ai n't going to be my last movie you know this is nollywood where the magic lives ra : so now you 're about to see how we do our own movies here with or without any assistance from anybody man : action cut franco sacchi : so many things to say so little time so many themes in this story i just ca n't tell you -- there 's one thing i want to tell you i spent you know several weeks with all these actors producers and the problems they have to go through are unimaginable for you know a westerner a filmmaker who works in america or in europe but always with a smile always with an enthusiasm that is incredible werner herzog the german filmmaker said " i need to make movies like you need oxygen " and i think they 're breathing the nigerian filmmakers really really are doing what they like and so it 's a very very important thing for them and for their audiences a woman told me " when i see a nollywood film i can relax i really -- i can breathe better " there is also another very important thing that i hope will resonate with this audience it 's technology i 'm very interested in it and i really think that the digital non-linear editing has slashed you know the cost now is a fraction of what it used to be incredible cameras cost under 5,000 dollars and this has unleashed tremendous energy and guess what we did n't have to tell to the nigerian filmmakers they understood it they embraced the technology and they run with it and they 're successful i hope that the nollywood phenomenon will go both ways i hope it will inspire other african nations to embrace the technology look at the nigerian model make their films create jobs create a narrative for the population something to identify something positive something that really is psychological relief and it 's part of the culture but i really think this is a phenomenon that can inspire us i really think it goes both ways filmmakers friends of mine they look at nollywood and they say " wow they are doing what we really want to do and make a buck and live with this job " so i really think it 's a lesson that we 're actually learning from them and there 's one thing one small challenge that i have for you and should make us reflect on the importance of storytelling and i think this is really the theme of this session try to imagine a world where the only goal is food and a shelter but no stories no stories around the campfire no legends no fairytales nothing no novels difficult eh it 's meaningless so this is what i really think i think that the key to a healthy society is a thriving community of storytellers and i think that the nigerian filmmakers really have proved this i would like you to hear their voices just a few moments it 's not an added sequence just some voices from nollywood toyin alousa : nollywood is the best thing that can happen to them if you have an industry that puts a smile on people 's face that 's nollywood so : i believe very soon we 're not only going to have better movies we 'll have that original nigerian movie be : it 's still the same basic themes love action but we 're telling it our own way our own nigerian way african way we have diverse cultures diverse cultures there are so many that in the natal lifetimes i do n't see us exhausting the stories we have fs : my job ends here and the nollywood filmmakers really have now to work and i really hope that there will be many many collaborations where we teach each other things and i really hope that this will happen thank you very much chris anderson : stop i 've got two questions franco you described this as the world 's third largest film industry what does that translate to in terms of numbers of films really fs : oh yes i think i mentioned briefly -- it 's close to 2,000 films there is scientific data on this ca : 2,000 films a year fs : 2,000 films a year 2005 or 6 the censor board has censored 1,600 films alone and we know that there are more so it 's safe to say that there are 2,000 films so imagine 45 films per week there are challenges there are challenges there is a glut of film the quality has to be raised they need to go to the next level but i 'm optimistic ca : and these are n't films that are primarily seen in cinemas fs : oh yes of course this is very important maybe you know for you to try to imagine this these are films that are distributed directly in markets they are bought in video shops they can be rented for pennies ca : on what format fs : oh the format -- thank you for the question yes it 's vcds it 's a cd it 's a little bit more compressed image they started with vhs they actually did n't wait for you know the latest technology they started in '92 '94 so there are 57 million vcrs in nigeria that play you know vhs and these vcds it 's a cd basically it 's a compact disc ca : so on the streets are film casts â€¦ fs : you can be in a lagos traffic jam and you can buy a movie or some bananas or some water yes and i have to say this really proves that storytelling it 's a commodity it 's a staple there is no life without stories ca : franco thank you so much i 'm going to go right into the slides and all i 'm going to try and prove to you with these slides is that i do just very straight stuff and my ideas are -- in my head anyway -- they 're very logical and relate to what 's going on and problem solving for clients i either convince clients at the end that i solve their problems or i really do solve their problems because usually they seem to like it let me go right into the slides can you turn off the light down i like to be in the dark i do n't want you to see what i 'm doing up here anyway i did this house in santa monica and it got a lot of notoriety in fact it appeared in a porno comic book which is the slide on the right this is in venice i just show it because i want you to know i 'm concerned about context on the left-hand side i had the context of those little houses and i tried to build a building that fit into that context when people take pictures of these buildings out of that context they look really weird and my premise is that they make a lot more sense when they 're photographed or seen in that space and then once i deal with the context i then try to make a place that 's comfortable and private and fairly serene as i hope you 'll find that slide on the right and then i did a law school for loyola in downtown l.a i was concerned about making a place for the study of law and we continue to work with this client the building on the right at the top is now under construction the garage on the right -- the gray structure -- will be torn down finally and several small classrooms will be placed along this avenue that we 've created this campus and it all related to the clients and the students from the very first meeting saying they felt denied a place they wanted a sense of place and so the whole idea here was to create that kind of space in downtown in a neighborhood that was difficult to fit into and it was my theory or my point of view that one did n't upstage the neighborhood -- one made accommodations i tried to be inclusive to include the buildings in the neighborhood whether they were buildings i liked or not in the '60s i started working with paper furniture and made a bunch of stuff that was very successful in bloomingdale 's we even made flooring walls and everything out of cardboard and the success of it threw me for a loop i could n't deal with the success of furniture -- i was n't secure enough as an architect -- and so i closed it all up and made furniture that nobody would like so nobody would like this and it was in this preliminary to these pieces of furniture that ricky and i worked on furniture by the slice and after we failed i just kept failing the piece on the left -- and that ultimately led to the piece on the right -- happened when the kid that was working on this took one of those long strings of stuff and folded it up to put it in the wastebasket and i put a piece of tape around it as you see there and realized you could sit on it and it had a lot of resilience and strength and so on so it was an accidental discovery i got into fish i mean the story i tell is that i got mad at postmodernism -- at po-mo -- and said that fish were 500 million years earlier than man and if you 're going to go back we might as well go back to the beginning and so i started making these funny things and they started to have a life of their own and got bigger -- as the one glass at the walker and then i sliced off the head and the tail and everything and tried to translate what i was learning about the form of the fish and the movement and a lot of my architectural ideas that came from it -- accidental again -- it was an intuitive kind of thing and i just kept going with it and made this proposal for a building which was only a proposal i did this building in japan i was taken out to dinner after the contract for this little restaurant was signed and i love sake and kobe and all that stuff and after i got -- i was really drunk -- i was asked to do some sketches on napkins and i made some sketches on napkins -- little boxes and morandi-like things that i used to do and the client said " why no fish " and so i made a drawing with a fish and i left japan three weeks later i received a complete set of drawings saying we 'd won the competition now it 's hard to do it 's hard to translate a fish form because they 're so beautiful -- perfect -- into a building or object like this and oldenburg who i work with a little once in a while told me i could n't do it and so that made it even more exciting but he was right -- i could n't do the tail i started to get the head ok but the tail i could n't do it was pretty hard the thing on the right is a snake form a ziggurat and i put them together and you walk between them it was a dialog with the context again now if you saw a picture of this as it was published in architectural record -- they did n't show the context so you would think " god what a pushy guy this is " but a friend of mine spent four hours wandering around here looking for this restaurant could n't find it so â€¦ as for craft and technology and all those things that you 've all been talking about i was thrown for a complete loop this was built in six months the way we sent drawings to japan : we used the magic computer in michigan that does carved models and we used to make foam models which that thing scanned we made the drawings of the fish and the scales and when i got there everything was perfect -- except the tail so i decided to cut off the head and the tail and i made the object on the left for my show at the walker and it 's one of the nicest pieces i 've ever made i think and then jay chiat a friend and client asked me to do his headquarters building in l.a for reasons we do n't want to talk about it got delayed toxic waste i guess is the key clue to that one and so we built a temporary building -- i 'm getting good at temporary -- and we put a conference room in that 's a fish and finally jay dragged me to my hometown toronto canada and there is a story -- it 's a real story -- about my grandmother buying a carp on thursday bringing it home putting it in the bathtub when i was a kid i played with it in the evening when i went to sleep the next day it was n't there and the next night we had gefilte fish and so i set up this interior for jay 's offices and i made a pedestal for a sculpture and he did n't buy a sculpture so i made one i went around toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother 's and i put the fish in it was a joke i play with funny people like [ claes ] oldenburg we 've been friends for a long time and we 've started to work on things a few years ago we did a performance piece in venice italy called " il corso del coltello " -- the swiss army knife and most of the imagery is -- claes ' but those two little boys are my sons and they were claes ' assistants in the play he was the swiss army knife he was a souvenir salesman who always wanted to be a painter and i was frankie p. toronto p for palladio dressed up like the at & amp ; t building by claes -- with a fish hat the highlight of the performance was at the end this beautiful object the swiss army knife which i get credit for participating in and i can tell you -- it 's totally an oldenburg i had nothing to do with it the only thing i did was i made it possible for them to turn those blades so you could sail this thing in the canal because i love sailing we made it into a sailing craft i 've been known to mess with things like chain link fencing i do it because it 's a curious thing in the culture when things are made in such great quantities absorbed in such great quantities and there 's so much denial about them people hate it and i 'm fascinated with that which like the paper furniture -- it 's one of those materials and i 'm always drawn to that and so i did a lot of dirty things with chain link which nobody will forgive me for but claes made homage to it in the loyola law school and that chain link is really expensive it 's in perspective and everything and then we did a camp together for children with cancer and you can see we started making a building together of course the milk can is his but we were trying to collide our ideas to put objects next to each other like a morandi -- like the little bottles -- composing them like a still life and it seemed to work as a way to put he and i together then jay chiat asked me to do this building on this funny lot in venice and i started with this three-piece thing and you entered in the middle and jay asked me what i was going to do with the piece in the middle and he pushed that and one day i had a -- oh well the other way i had the binoculars from claes and i put them there and i could never get rid of them after that oldenburg made the binoculars incredible when he sent me the first model of the real proposal it made my building look sick and it was this interaction between that kind of up-the-ante stuff that became pretty interesting it led to the building on the left and i still think the time magazine picture will be of the binoculars you know leaving out the -- what the hell i use a lot of metal in my work and i have a hard time connecting with the craft the whole thing about my house the whole use of rough carpentry and everything was the frustration with the crafts available i said " if i ca n't get the craft that i want i 'll use the craft i can get " there were plenty of models for that in rauschenberg and jasper johns and many artists who were making beautiful art and sculpture with junk materials i went into the metal because it was a way of building a building that was a sculpture and it was all of one material and the metal could go on the roof as well as the walls the metalworkers for the most part do ducts behind the ceilings and stuff i was given an opportunity to design an exhibit for the metalworkers ' unions of america and canada in washington and i did it on the condition that they become my partners in the future and help me with all future metal buildings etc etc and it 's working very well to have these people these craftsmen interested in it i just tell the stories it 's a way of connecting at least with some of those people that are so important to the realization of architecture the metal continued into a building -- herman miller in sacramento and it 's just a complex of factory buildings and herman miller has this philosophy of having a place -- a people place i mean it 's kind of a trite thing to say but it is real that they wanted to have a central place where the cafeteria would be where the people would come and where the people working would interact so it 's out in the middle of nowhere and you approach it it 's copper and galvanize i used the galvanize and copper in a very light gauge so it would buckle i spent a lot of time undoing richard meier 's aesthetic everybody 's trying to get the panels perfect and i always try to get them sloppy and fuzzy and they end up looking like stone this is the central area there 's a ramp and that little dome in there is a building by stanley tigerman stanley was instrumental in my getting this job and when i was awarded the contract i at the very beginning asked the client if they would let stanley do a cameo piece with me because these were ideas that we were talking about building things next to each other making -- it 's all about [ a ] metaphor for a city maybe and so stanley did the little dome thing and we did it over the phone and by fax he would send me a fax and show me something he 'd made a building with a dome and he had a little tower i told him " no no that 's too ongepotchket i do n't want the tower " so he came back with a simpler building but he put some funny details on it and he moved it closer to my building and so i decided to put him in a depression i put him in a hole and made a kind of a hole that he sits in and so then he put two bridges -- this all happened on the fax going back and forth over a couple of weeks ' period and he put these two bridges with pink guardrails on it and so then i put this big billboard behind it and i call it " david and goliath " and that 's my cafeteria in boston we had that old building on the left it was a very prominent building off the freeway and we added a floor and cleaned it up and fixed it up and used the kind of -- i thought -- the language of the neighborhood which had these cornices projecting cornices mine got a little exuberant but i used lead copper which is a beautiful material and it turns green in 100 years instead of like copper in 10 or 15 we redid the side of the building and re-proportioned the windows so it sort of fit into the space and it surprised both boston and myself that we got it approved because they have very strict kind of design guideline and they would n't normally think i would fit them the detailing was very careful with the lead copper and making panels and fitting it tightly into the fabric of the existing building in barcelona on las ramblas for some film festival i did the hollywood sign going and coming made a building out of it and they built it i flew in one night and took this picture but they made it a third smaller than my model without telling me and then more metal and some chain link in santa monica -- a little shopping center and this is a laser laboratory at the university of iowa in which the fish comes back as an abstraction in the back it 's the support labs which by some coincidence required no windows and the shape fit perfectly i just joined the points in the curved part there 's all the mechanical equipment that solid wall behind it is a pipe chase -- a pipe canyon -- and so it was an opportunity that i seized because i did n't have to have any protruding ducts or vents or things in this form it gave me an opportunity to make a sculpture out of it this is a small house somewhere they 've been building it so long i do n't remember where it is it 's in the west valley and we started with the stream and built the house along the stream -- dammed it up to make a lake these are the models the reality with the lake -- the workmanship is pretty bad and it reminded me why i play defensively in things like my house when you have to do something really cheaply it 's hard to get perfect corners and stuff that big metal thing is a passage and in it is -- you go downstairs into the living room and then down into the bedroom which is on the right it 's kind of like a whole built town i was asked to do a hospital for schizophrenic adolescents at yale i thought it was fitting for me to be doing that this is a house next to a philip johnson house in minnesota the owners had a dilemma -- they asked philip to do it he was too busy he did n't recommend me by the way we ended up having to make it a sculpture because the dilemma was how do you build a building that does n't look like the language is it going to look like this beautiful estate is sub-divided etc etc you 've got the idea and so we finally ended up making it these people are art collectors and we finally made it so it appears very sculptural from the main house and all the windows are on the other side and the building is very sculptural as you walk around it it 's made of metal and the brown stuff is fin-ply -- it 's that formed lumber from finland we used it at loyola on the chapel and it did n't work i keep trying to make it work in this case we learned how to detail it in cleveland there 's burnham mall on the left it 's never been finished going out to the lake you can see all those new buildings we built and we had the opportunity to build a building on this site there 's a railroad track this is the city hall over here somewhere and the courthouse and the centerline of the mall goes out burnham had designed a railroad station that was never built and so we followed sohio is on the axis here and we followed the axis and they 're two kind of goalposts and this is our building which is a corporate headquarters for an insurance company we collaborated with oldenburg and put the newspaper on top folded the health club is fastened to the garage with a c-clamp for cleveland you drive down so it 's about a 10-story c-clamp and all this stuff at the bottom is a museum and an idea for a very fancy automobile entry this owner has a pet peeve about bad automobile entries and this would be a hotel so the centerline of this thing -- we 'd preserve it and it would start to work with the scale of the new buildings by pelli and kohn pederson fox etc. that are underway it 's hard to do high-rise i feel much more comfortable down here this is a piece of property in brentwood and a long time ago about '82 or something after my house -- i designed a house for myself that would be a village of several pavilions around a courtyard -- and the owner of this lot worked for me and built that actual model on the left and she came back i guess wealthier or something -- something happened -- and asked me to design a house for her on this site and following that basic idea of the village we changed it as we got into it i locked the house into the site by cutting the back end -- here you see on the photographs of the site -- slicing into it and putting all the bathrooms and dressing rooms like a retaining wall creating a lower level zone for the master bedroom which i designed like a kind of a barge looking like a boat and that 's it built the dome was a request from the client she wanted a dome somewhere in the house she did n't care where when you sleep in this bedroom i hope -- i mean i have n't slept in it yet i 've offered to marry her so i could sleep there but she said i did n't have to do that but when you 're in that room you feel like you 're on a kind of barge on some kind of lake and it 's very private the landscape is being built around to create a private garden and then up above there 's a garden on this side of the living room and one on the other side these are n't focused very well i do n't know how to do it from here focus the one on the right it 's up there left -- it 's my right anyway you enter into a garden with a beautiful grove of trees that 's the living room servants ' quarters a guest bedroom which has this dome with marble on it and then you enter into the living room and then so on this is the bedroom you come down from this level along the stairway and you enter the bedroom here going into the lake and the bed is back in this space with windows looking out onto the lake these stonehenge things were designed to give foreground and to create a greater depth in this shallow lot the material is lead copper like in the building in boston and so it was an intent to make this small piece of land -- it 's 100 by 250 -- into a kind of an estate by separating these areas and making the living room and dining room into this pavilion with a high space in it and this happened by accident that i got this right on axis with the dining room table it looks like i got a baldessari painting for free but the idea is the windows are all placed so you see pieces of the house outside eventually this will be screened -- these trees will come up -- and it will be very private and you feel like you 're in your own kind of village this is for michael eisner -- disney we 're doing some work for him and this is in anaheim california and it 's a freeway building you go under this bridge at about 65 miles an hour and there 's another bridge here and you 're through this room in a split second and the building will sort of reflect that on the backside it 's much more humane -- entrance dining hall etc and then this thing here -- i 'm hoping as you drive by you 'll hear the picket fence effect of the sound hitting it kind of a fun thing to do i 'm doing a building in switzerland basel which is an office building for a furniture company and we struggled with the image these are the early studies but they have to sell furniture to normal people so if i did the building and it was too fancy then people might say " well the furniture looks ok in his thing but no it ai n't going to look good in my normal building " so we 've made a kind of pragmatic slab in the second phase here and we 've taken the conference facilities and made a villa out of them so that the communal space is very sculptural and separate and you 're looking at it from the offices and you create a kind of interaction between these pieces this is in paris along the seine palais des sports the gare de lyon over here the minister of finance -- the guy that moved from the louvre -- goes in here there 's a new library across the river and back in here in this already treed park we 're doing a very dense building called the american center which has a theater apartments dance school an art museum restaurants and all kinds of -- it 's a very dense program -- bookstores etc in a very tight small -- this is the ground level and the french have this extraordinary way of screwing things up by taking a beautiful site and cutting the corner off they call it the plan coupe and i struggled with that thing -- how to get around the corner these are the models for it i showed you the other model the one -- this is the way i organized myself so i could make the drawing -- so i understood the problem i was trying to get around this plan coupe -- how do you do it apartments etc and these are the kind of study models we did and the one on the left is pretty awful you can see why i was ready to commit suicide when this one was built but out of it came finally this resolution where the elevator piece worked frontally to this parallel to this street and also parallel to here and then this kind of twist with this balcony and the skirt kind of like a ballerina lifting her skirt to let you into the foyer the restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater etc so it would all be built in stone in french limestone except for this metal piece and it faces into a park and the idea was to make this express the energy of this on the side facing the street it 's much more normal except i slipped a few mansards down so that coming on the point these housing units made a gesture to the corner and this will be some kind of high-tech billboard if any of you guys have any ideas for it please contact me i do n't know what to do jay chiat is a glutton for punishment and he hired me to do a house for him in the hamptons and it 's got a fish and i keep thinking " this is going to be the last fish " it 's like a drug addict i say " i 'm not going to do it anymore -- i do n't want to do it anymore -- i 'm not going to do it " and then i do it there it is but it 's the living room and this piece here is -- i do n't know what it is i just added it so that we 'd have enough money in the budget so we could take something out this is euro disney and i 've worked with all of the guys that presented to you earlier we 've had a lot of fun working together i think i 'm from mars for them and they are for me but somehow we all manage to work together and i think productively so far this is a shopping thing you come into the magic kingdom and the hotel that tony baxter 's group is doing out here and then this is a kind of a shopping mall with a rodeo and restaurants and another restaurant what i did -- because of the paris skies being quite dull i made a light grid that 's perpendicular to the train station to the route of the train it looks like it 's kind of been there and then crashed all these simpler forms into it the light grid will have a light be lit up at night and give a kind of light ceiling in switzerland -- germany actually -- on the rhine across from basel we did a furniture factory and a furniture museum and i tried to -- there 's a nick grimshaw building over here there 's an oldenburg sculpture over here -- i tried to make a relationship urbanistically and i do n't gave good slides to show -- it 's just been completed -- but this piece here is this building and these pieces here and here and as you pass by it 's always part -- you see it as all of these pieces accrue and become part of an overall neighborhood it 's plaster and just zinc and you wonder if this is a museum what it 's going to be like inside if it 's going to be so busy and crazy that you would n't show anything and just wait i 'm so cunning and clever -- i made it quiet and wonderful but on the outside it does scream out at you a bit it 's actually basically three square rooms with a couple of skylights and stuff and from the building in the back you see it as an iceberg floating by in the hills i know i 'm over time see that skylight goes down and becomes that one so it 's pretty quiet inside this is the disney hall -- the concert hall it 's a complicated project it has a chamber hall it 's related to an existing chandler pavilion that was built with a lot of love and tears and caring and it 's not a great building but i approached it optimistically that we would make a compositional relationship between us that would strengthen both of us and the plan of this -- it 's a concert hall this is the foyer which is kind of a garden structure there 's commercial at the ground floor these are offices which really in the competition we did n't have to design but finally there 's a hotel there these were the kind of relationships made to the chandler composing these elevations together and relating them to the buildings that existed -- to moca etc the acoustician in the competition gave us criteria which led to this compartmentalized scheme which we found out after the competition would not work at all but everybody liked these forms and liked the space and so that 's one of the problems of a competition you have to then try and get that back in some way and we studied many models this was our original model these were the three buildings that were the ideal -- the concertgebouw boston and berlin everybody liked the surround actually this is the smallest hall in size and it has more seats than any of these because it has double balconies our client does n't want balconies so -- and when we met our new acoustician he told us this was the right shape or this was the right shape and we tried many shapes trying to get the energy of the original design within an acoustical acceptable format we finally settled on a shape that was the proportion of the concertgebouw with the sloping outside walls which the acoustician said were crucial to this and later decided they were n't but now we have them and our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room that 's the idea and the corners would have skylights and these columns would be structural and the nice thing about introducing columns is they give you a kind of sense of proscenium from wherever you sit and create intimacy now this is not a final design -- these are just on the way to being -- and so i would n't take it literally except the feeling of the space we studied the acoustics with laser stuff and they bounce them off this and see where it all works but you get the sense of the hall in section most halls come straight down into a proscenium in this case we 're opening it back up and getting skylights in the four corners and so it will be quite a different shape the original building because it was frog-like fit nicely on the site and cranked itself well when you get into a box it 's harder to do it -- and here we are struggling with how to put the hotel in and this is a teapot i designed for alessi i just stuck it on there but this is how i do work i do take pieces and bits and look at it and struggle with it and cut it away and of course it 's not going to look like that but it is the crazy way i tend to work and then finally in l.a i was asked to do a sculpture at the foot of interstate bank tower the highest building in l.a larry halprin is doing the stairs and i was asked to do a fish and so i did a snake it 's a public space and i made it kind of a garden structure and you can go in it it 's a kiva and larry 's putting some water in there and it works much better than a fish in barcelona i was asked to do a fish and we 're working on that at the foot of a ritz-carlton tower being done by skidmore owings and merrill and the ritz-carlton tower is being designed with exposed steel non-fire proof much like those old gas tanks and so we took the language of this exposed steel and used it perverted it into the form of the fish and created a kind of a 19th-century contraption that looks like that will sit -- this is the beach and the harbor out in front and this is really a shopping center with department stores and we split these bridges originally this was all solid with a hole in it we cut them loose and made several bridges and created a kind of a foreground for this hotel we showed this to the hotel people the other day and they were terrified and said that nobody would come to the ritz-carlton anymore because of this fish and finally i just threw these in -- lou danziger i did n't expect lou danziger to be here but this is a building i did for him in 1964 i think a little studio -- and it 's sadly for sale time goes on and this is my son working with me on a small fast-food thing he designed the robot as the cashier and the head moves and i did the rest of it and the food was n't as good as the stuff and so it failed it should have been the other way around -- the food should have been good first it did n't work thank you very much in terms of invention i 'd like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects i think it 's one of the most exciting that i 'm working on but i think it 's also the simplest it 's a project that has the potential to make a huge impact around the world it addresses one of the biggest health issues on the planet the number one cause of death in children under five which is â€¦ water-borne diseases diarrhea malnutrition no it 's breathing the smoke from indoor cooking fires -- acute respiratory infections caused by this can you believe that i find this shocking and somewhat appalling ca n't we make cleaner burning cooking fuels ca n't we make better stoves how is it that this can lead to over two million deaths every year i know bill joy was talking to you about the wonders of carbon nanotubes so i 'm going to talk to you about the wonders of carbon macro-tubes which is charcoal so this is a picture of rural haiti haiti is now 98 percent deforested you 'll see scenes like this all over the island it leads to all sorts of environmental problems and problems that affect people throughout the nation a couple years ago there was severe flooding that led to thousands of deaths -- that 's directly attributable to the fact that there are no trees on the hills to stabilize the soil so the rains come they go down the rivers and the flooding happens now one of the reasons why there are so few trees is this : people need to cook and they harvest wood and they make charcoal in order to do it it 's not that people are ignorant to the environmental damage they know perfectly well but they have no other choice fossil fuels are not available and solar energy does n't cook the way that they like their food prepared and so this is what they do you 'll find families like this who go out into the forest to find a tree cut it down and make charcoal out of it so not surprisingly there 's a lot of effort that 's been done to look at alternative cooking fuels about four years ago i took a team of students down to haiti and we worked with peace corps volunteers there this is one such volunteer and this is a device that he had built in the village where he worked and the idea was that you could take waste paper ; you could compress it ; and make briquettes that could be used for fuel but this device was very slow so our engineering students went to work on it and with some very simple changes they were able to triple the throughput of this device so you could imagine they were very excited about it and they took the briquettes back to mit so that they could test them and one of the things that they found was they did n't burn so it was a little discouraging to the students and in fact if you look closely right here you can see it says " u.s. peace corps " as it turns out there actually was n't any waste paper in this village and while it was a good use of government paperwork for this volunteer to bring it back with him to his village it was 800 kilometers away and so we thought perhaps there might be a better way to come up with an alternative cooking fuel what we wanted to do is we wanted to make a fuel that used something that was readily available on the local level you see these all over haiti as well they 're small-scale sugar mills and the waste product from them after you extract the juice from the sugarcane is called " bagasse " it has no other use it has no nutritional value so they do n't feed it to the animals it just sits in a pile near the sugar mill until eventually they burn it what we wanted to do was we wanted to find a way to harness this waste resource and turn it into a fuel that would be something that people could easily cook with something like charcoal so over the next couple of years students and i worked to develop a process so you start with the bagasse and then you take a very simple kiln that you can make out of a waste fifty five-gallon oil drum after some time after setting it on fire you seal it to restrict the oxygen that goes into the kiln and then you end up with this carbonized material here however you ca n't burn this it 's too fine and it burns too quickly to be useful for cooking so we had to try to find a way to form it into useful briquettes and conveniently one of my students was from ghana and he remembered a dish his mom used to make for him called " kokonte " which is a very sticky porridge made out of the cassava root and so what we did was we looked and we found that cassava is indeed grown in haiti under the name of " manioc " and in fact it 's grown all over the world -- yucca tapioca manioc cassava it 's all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable and you can make a very thick sticky porridge out of it which you can use to bind together the charcoal briquettes so we did this we went down to haiti these are the graduates of the first ecole de chabon or charcoal institute and these -- -- that 's right so i 'm actually an instructor at mit as well as cit and these are the briquettes that we made now i 'm going to take you to a different continent this is india and this is the most commonly used cooking fuel in india ; it 's cow dung and more than in haiti this produces really smoky fires and this is where you see the health impacts of cooking with cow dung and biomass as a fuel kids and women are especially affected by it because they 're the ones who are around the cooking fires so we wanted to see if we could introduce this charcoal-making technology there well unfortunately they did n't have sugarcane and they did n't have cassava but that did n't stop us what we did was we found what were the locally available sources of biomass and there was wheat straw and there was rice straw in this area and what we could use as a binder was actually small amounts of cow manure which they used ordinarily for their fuel and we did side-by-side tests and here you can see the charcoal briquettes and here the cow dung and you can see that it 's a lot cleaner burning of a cooking fuel and in fact it heats the water a lot more quickly and so we were very happy thus far but one of the things that we found was when we did side-by-side comparisons with wood charcoal it did n't burn as long and the briquettes crumbled a little bit and we lost energy as they fell apart as they were cooking so we wanted to try to find a way to make a stronger briquette so that we could compete with wood charcoal in the markets in haiti so we went back to mit we took out the instron machine and we figured out what sort of forces did you need in order to compress a briquette to the level and at the same time that we had students in the lab looking at this we also had community partners in haiti working to develop the process to improve it and to make it more accessible to people in the villages there and after some time we developed a low-cost press that allows you to produce charcoal which actually now burns longer cleaner than wood charcoal so now we 're in a situation where we have a product which is actually better than what you can buy in haiti in the marketplace which is a very wonderful place to be in haiti alone about 30 million trees are cut down every year there 's a possibility of this being implemented and saving a good portion of those in addition the revenue generated from that charcoal is 260 million dollars that 's an awful lot for a country of haiti -- with a population of eight million and an average income of less than 400 dollars so this is where we 're also moving ahead with our charcoal project and one of the things that i think is also interesting is i have a friend up at uc berkeley who 's been doing risk analysis and he 's looked at the problem of the health impacts of burning wood versus charcoal and he 's found that worldwide you could prevent a million deaths switching from wood to charcoal as a cooking fuel that 's remarkable but up until now there were n't ways to do it without cutting down trees but now we have a way that 's using an agricultural waste material to create a cooking fuel one of the really exciting things though is something that came out of the trip that i took to ghana just last month and this is i think the coolest thing and it 's even lower tech than what you just saw so what is this this is corncobs turned into charcoal and the beauty of this is that you do n't need to form briquettes -- it comes ready made this is my $ 100 laptop right here and actually like nick i brought samples so we can pass these around they 're fully functional field-tested ready to roll out and i think one of the things which is also remarkable about this technology is that the technology transfer is so easy compared to the sugarcane charcoal where we actually have to teach people how to form it into briquettes and you have the extra step of cooking the binder this comes pre-briquetted and this is about the most exciting thing in my life right now which is perhaps a sad commentary on my life but once you see it like you guys in the front row all right yeah ok so anyway -- -- here it is and this is i think a perfect example of what robert wright was talking about in those non-zero-sum things so not only do you have health benefits you have environmental benefits but this is one of the incredibly rare situations where you also have economic benefits people can make their own cooking fuel from waste products they can generate income from this they can save the money that they were going to spend on charcoal and they can produce excess and sell it in the market to people who are n't making their own it 's really rare that you do n't have trade-offs between health and economics or environment and economics so this is a project that i just find extremely exciting and i 'm really looking forward to see where it takes us so when we talk about now the future we will create one of the things that i think is necessary is to have a very clear vision of the world that we live in and now i do n't actually mean the world that we live in i mean the world where women spend two to three hours everyday grinding grain for their families to eat i mean the world where advanced building materials means cement roofing tiles that are made by hand and where when you work 10 hours a day you 're still only earning 60 dollars in a month i mean the world where women and children spend 40 billion hours a year fetching water that 's as if the entire workforce of the state of california worked full time for a year doing nothing but fetching water it 's a place where for example if this were india in this room only three of us would have a car if this were afghanistan only one person in this room would know how the use the internet if this were zambia 300 of you would be farmers 100 of you would have aids or hiv and more than half of you would be living on less than a dollar a day these are the issues that we need to come up with solutions for these are the issues that we need to be training our engineers our designers our business people our entrepreneurs to be facing these are the solutions that we need to find i have a few areas that i believe are especially important that we address one of them is creating technologies to promote micro-finance and micro-enterprise so that people who are living below the poverty line can find a way to move out -- and that they 're not doing it using the same traditional basket making poultry rearing etc but there are new technologies and new products that they can make on a small scale the next thing i believe is that we need to create technologies for poor farmers to add value to their own crops and we need to rethink our development strategies so that we 're not promoting educational campaigns to get them to stop being farmers but rather to stop being poor farmers and we need to think about how we can do that effectively we need to work with the people in these communities and give them the resources and the tools that they need to solve their own problems that 's the best way to do it we should n't be doing it from outside so we need to create this future and we need to start doing it now thank you chris anderson : tell us -- just while we see if someone has a question -- just tell us about one of the other things that you 've worked on amy smith : a couple of other things that we 're working on are looking at ways to do low-cost water quality testing so that communities can maintain their own water systems know when they 're working know when they treat them etc we 're also looking at low-cost water treatment systems one of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that ca : what 's the bottleneck to preventing this stuff getting from scale do you need to find entrepreneurs or venture capitalists or what do you need to take what you 've got and get it to scale as : yeah i think its large numbers of people moving it forward it 's a difficult thing ; it 's a marketplace which is very fragmented and a consumer population with no income so you ca n't use the same models that you use in the united states for making things move forward and we 're a pretty small staff which is me so you know i do what i can with the students we have 30 students a year go out into the field and try to implement this and move it forward the other thing is you have to do things with a long time frame as -- you know you ca n't expect to get something done in a year or two years ; you have to be looking five or 10 years ahead but i think with the vision to do that we can move forward i do n't know what the hell i 'm doing here i was born in a scots presbyterian ghetto in canada and dropped out of high school i do n't own a cell phone and i paint on paper using gouache which has n't changed in 600 years but about three years ago i had an art show in new york and i titled it " serious nonsense " so i think i 'm actually the first one here -- i lead i called it " serious nonsense " because on the serious side i use a technique of painstaking realism of editorial illustration from when i was a kid i copied it and i never unlearned it -- it 's the only style i know and it 's very kind of staid and formal and meanwhile i use nonsense as you can see this is a scottish castle where people are playing golf indoors and the trick was to bang the golf ball off of suits of armor -- which you ca n't see there this was one of a series called " zany afternoons " which became a book this is a home-built rocket-propelled car that 's a 1953 henry j -- i 'm a bug for authenticity -- in a quiet neighborhood in toledo this is my submission for the l.a. museum of film you can probably tell frank gehry and i come from the same town my work is so personal and so strange that i have to invent my own lexicon for it and i work a lot in what i call " retrofuturism " which is looking back to see how yesterday viewed tomorrow and they 're always wrong always hilariously optimistically wrong and the peak time for that was the 30s because the depression was so dismal that anything to get away from the present into the future â€¦ and technology was going to carry us along this is popular workbench popular science magazines in those days -- i had a huge collection of them from the '30s -- all they are is just poor people being asked to make sunglasses out of wire coat hangers and everything improvised and dreaming about these wonderful giant radio robots playing ice hockey at 300 miles an hour -- it 's all going to happen it 's all going to be wonderful automotive retrofuturism is one of my specialties i was both an automobile illustrator and an advertising automobile copywriter so i have a lot of revenge to take on the subject detroit has always been halfway into the future -- the advertising half this is the '58 bulgemobile : so new they make tomorrow look like yesterday this is a chain gang of guys admiring the car that 's from a whole catalog -- it 's 18 pages or so -- ran back in the days of the lampoon where i cut my teeth techno-archaeology is digging back and finding past miracles that never happened -- for good reason usually the zeppelin -- this was from a brochure about the zeppelin based obviously on the hindenburg but the zeppelin was the biggest thing that ever moved made by man and it carried 56 people at the speed of a buick at an altitude you could hear dogs bark and it cost twice as much as a first-class cabin on the normandie to fly it so the hindenburg was n't you know it was inevitable it was going to go this is auto-gyro jousting in malibu in the 30s the auto-gyro could n't wait for the invention of the helicopter but it should have -- it was n't a big success it 's the only spanish innovation technologically of the 20th century by the way you needed to know that the flying car which never got off the ground -- it was a post-war dream my old man used to tell me we were going to get a flying car this is pitched into the future from 1946 looking at the day all american families have them " there 's moscow shirley hope they speak esperanto ! " faux-nostalgia which i 'm sort of -- not say famous for but i work an awful lot in it it 's the achingly sentimental yearning for times that never happened somebody once said that nostalgia is the one utterly most useless human emotion -- so i think that 's a case for serious play this is emblematic of it -- this is wing dining recalling those balmy summer days somewhere over france in the 20s dining on the wing of a plane you ca n't see it very well here but that 's hemingway reading some pages from his new novel to fitzgerald and ford madox ford until the slipstream blows him away this is tank polo in the south hamptons the brainless rich are more fun to make fun of than anybody i do a lot of that and authenticity is a major part of my serious nonsense i think it adds a huge amount those for example are mark iv british tanks from 1916 they had two machine guns and a cannon and they had 90 horsepower ricardo engines they went five miles an hour and inside it was 105 degrees in the pitch dark and they had a canary hung inside the thing to make sure the germans were n't going to use gas happy little story is n't it this is motor ritz towers in manhattan in the 30s where you drove up to your front door if you had the guts anybody who was anybody had an apartment there i managed to stick in both the zeppelin and an ocean liner out of sheer enthusiasm and i love cigars -- there 's a cigar billboard down there and faux-nostalgia works even in serious subjects like war this is those wonderful days of the battle of britain in 1940 when a messerschmitt me109 bursts into the house of commons and buzzes around just to piss off churchill who 's down there somewhere it 's a fond memory of times past hyperbolic overkill is a way of taking exaggeration to the absolute ultimate limit just for the fun of it this was a piece i did -- a brochure again -- " rms tyrannic : the biggest thing in all the world " the copy which you ca n't see because it goes on and on for several pages says that steerage passengers ca n't get their to bunks before the voyage is over and it 's so safe it carries no insurance it 's obviously modeled on the titanic but it 's not a cri de coeur about man 's hubris in the face of the elements it 's just a sick silly joke shamelessly cheap is something i think -- this will wake you up it has no meaning just -- desoto discovers the mississippi and it 's a desoto discovering the mississippi i did that as a quick back page -- i had like four hours to do a back page for an issue of the lampoon and i did that and i thought " well i 'm ashamed i hope nobody knows it " people wrote in for reprints of that thing urban absurdism -- that 's what the new yorker really calls for i try to make life in new york look even weirder than it is with those covers i 've done about 40 of them and i 'd say 30 of them are based on that concept i was driving down 7th avenue one night at 3 a.m. and this steam pouring out of the street and i thought " what causes that " and that -- who 's to say the temple of dendur at the metropolitan in new york -- it 's a very somber place i thought i could jazz it up a bit have a little fun with it this is a very un-pc cover not in new york i could n't resist and i got a nasty email from some environmental group saying " this is too serious and solemn to make fun of you should be ashamed please apologize on our website " have n't got around to it yet but -- i may this is the word side of my brain i love the word " eurotrash " that 's all the eurotrash coming through jfk customs this was the new york bike messenger meeting the tour de france if you live in new york you know how the bike messengers move except that he 's carrying a tube for blueprints and stuff -- they all do -- and a lot of people thought that meant it was a terrorist about to shoot rockets at the tour de france -- sign of our times i guess this is the only fashion cover i 've ever done it 's the little old lady that lives in a shoe and then this thing -- the title of that was " there goes the neighborhood " i do n't know a hell of a lot about fashion -- i was told to do what they call a mary jane and then i got into this terrible fight between the art director and the editor saying : " put a strap on it " -- " no do n't put a strap on it " -- " put a strap on it -- " do n't put a strap on it " -- because it obscures the logo and looks terrible and it 's bad and -- i finally chickened out and did it for the sake of the authenticity of the shoe this is a tiny joke -- e-zr pass one letter makes an idea this is a big joke this is the audition for " king kong " people always ask me where do you get your ideas how do your ideas come truth about that one is i had a horrible red wine hangover in the middle of the night this came to me like a xerox -- all i had to do was write it down it was perfectly clear i did n't do any thinking about it and then when it ran a lovely lady an old lady named mrs. edgar rosenberg -- if you know that name -- called me and said she loved the cover it was so sweet her former name was fay wray and so that was -- i did n't have the wit to say " take the painting " finally this was a three-page cover never done before and i do n't think it will ever be done again -- successive pages in the front of the magazine it 's the ascent of man using an escalator and it 's in three parts you ca n't see it all together unfortunately but if you look at it enough you can sort of start to see how it actually starts to move pretty elegant nothing like a crash to end a joke that completes my oeuvre i would just like to add a crass commercial -- i have a kids ' book coming out in the fall called " marvel sandwiches " a compendium of all the serious play that ever was and it 's going to be available in fine bookstores crummy bookstores tables on the street in october so thank you very much frank gehry : i listened to this scientist this morning dr. mullis was talking about his experiments and i realized that i almost became a scientist when i was 14 my parents bought me a chemistry set and i decided to make water so i made a hydrogen generator and i made an oxygen generator and i had the two pipes leading into a beaker and i threw a match in and the glass -- luckily i turned around -- i had it all in my back and i was about 15 feet away the wall was covered with â€¦ i had an explosion richard saul wurman : really fg : people on the street came and knocked on the door to see if i was okay rsw : â€¦ huh i 'd like to start this session again the gentleman to my left is the very famous perhaps overly famous frank gehry and frank you 've come to a place in your life which is astonishing i mean it is astonishing for an artist for an architect to become actually an icon and a legend in their own time i mean you have become whether you can giggle at it because it 's a funny â€¦ you know it 's a strange thought but your building is an icon -- you can draw a little picture of that building it can be used in ads -- and you 've had not rock star status but celebrity status in doing what you wanted to do for most of your life and i know the road was extremely difficult and it did n't seem at least that your sell outs whatever they were were very big you kept moving ahead in a life where you 're dependent on working for somebody but that 's an interesting thing for a creative person a lot of us work for people ; we 're in the hands of other people and that 's one of the great dilemmas -- we 're in a creativity session -- it 's one of the great dilemmas in creativity : how to do work that 's big enough and not sell out and you 've achieved that and that makes your win doubly big triply big it 's not quite a question but you can comment on it it 's a big issue fg : well i 've always just â€¦ i 've never really gone out looking for work i always waited for it to sort of hit me on the head and when i started out i thought that architecture was a service business and that you had to please the clients and stuff and i realized when i 'd come into the meetings with these corrugated metal and chain link stuff and people would just look at me like i 'd just landed from mars but i could n't do anything else that was my response to the people in the time and actually it was responding to clients that i had who did n't have very much money so they could n't afford very much i think it was circumstantial until i got to my house where the client was my wife we bought this tiny little bungalow in santa monica and for like 50 grand i built a house around it and a few people got excited about it i was visiting with an artist michael heizer out in the desert near las vegas somewhere he 's building this huge concrete place and it was late in the evening we 'd had a lot to drink we were standing out in the desert all alone and thinking about my house he said " did it ever occur to you if you built stuff more permanent somewhere in 2000 years somebody 's going to like it " so i thought " yeah that 's probably a good idea " luckily i started to get some clients that had a little more money so the stuff was a little more permanent but i just found out the world ai n't going to last that long this guy was telling us the other day so where do we go now back to -- everything 's so temporary i do n't see it the way you characterized it for me every day is a new thing i approach each project with a new insecurity almost like the first project i ever did and i get the sweats i go in and start working i 'm not sure where i 'm going -- if i knew where i was going i would n't do it when i can predict or plan it i do n't do it i discard it so i approach it with the same trepidation obviously over time i have a lot more confidence that it 's going to be ok i do run a kind of a business -- i 've got 120 people and you 've got to pay them so there 's a lot of responsibility involved -- but the actual work on the project is with i think a healthy insecurity and like the playwright said the other day -- i could relate to him : you 're not sure when bilbao was finished and i looked at it i saw all the mistakes i saw â€¦ they were n't mistakes ; i saw everything that i would have changed and i was embarrassed by it i felt an embarrassment -- " how could i have done that how could i have made shapes like that or done stuff like that " it 's taken several years to now look at it detached and say -- as you walk around the corner and a piece of it works with the road and the street and it appears to have a relationship -- that i started to like it rsw : what 's the status of the new york project fg : i do n't really know tom krens came to me with bilbao and explained it all to me and i thought he was nuts i did n't think he knew what he was doing and he pulled it off so i think he 's icarus and phoenix all in one guy he gets up there and then he â€¦ comes back up they 're still talking about it september 11 generated some interest in moving it over to ground zero and i 'm totally against that i just feel uncomfortable talking about or building anything on ground zero i think for a long time rsw : the picture on the screen is that disney fg : yeah rsw : how much further along is it than that and when will that be finished fg : that will be finished in 2003 -- september october -- and i 'm hoping kyu and herbie and yo-yo and all those guys come play with us at that place luckily today most of the people i 'm working with are people i really like richard koshalek is probably one of the main reasons that disney hall came to me he 's been a cheerleader for quite a long time there are n't many people around that are really involved with architecture as clients if you think about the world and even just in this audience most of us are involved with buildings nothing that you would call architecture right and so to find one a guy like that you hang on to him he 's become the head of art center and there 's a building by craig ellwood there i knew craig and respected him they want to add to it and it 's hard to add to a building like that -- it 's a beautiful minimalist black steel building -- and richard wants to add a library and more student stuff and it 's a lot of acreage i convinced him to let me bring in another architect from portugal : alvaro siza rsw : why did you want that fg : i knew you 'd ask that question it was intuitive alvaro siza grew up and lived in portugal and is probably considered the portuguese main guy in architecture i visited with him a few years ago and he showed me his early work and his early work had a resemblance to my early work when i came out of college i started to try to do things contextually in southern california and you got into the logic of spanish colonial tile roofs and things like that i tried to understand that language as a beginning as a place to jump off and there was so much of it being done by spec builders and it was trivialized so much that it was n't â€¦ i just stopped i mean charlie moore did a bunch of it but it did n't feel good to me siza on the other hand continued in portugal where the real stuff was and evolved a modern language that relates to that historic language and i always felt that he should come to southern california and do a building i tried to get him a couple of jobs and they did n't pan out i like the idea of collaboration with people like that because it pushes you i 've done it with claes oldenburg and with richard serra who does n't think architecture is art did you see that thing rsw : no what did he say fg : he calls architecture " plumbing " fg : anyway the siza thing it 's a richer experience it must be like that for kyu doing things with musicians -- it 's similar to that i would imagine -- where you â€¦ huh audience : liquid architecture fg : liquid architecture where you â€¦ it 's like jazz : you improvise you work together you play off each other you make something they make something and i think for me it 's a way of trying to understand the city and what might happen in the city rsw : is it going to be near the current campus or is it going to be down near â€¦ fg : no it 's near the current campus anyway he 's that kind of patron it 's not his money of course rsw : what 's his schedule on that fg : i do n't know what 's the schedule richard richard koshalek : [ unclear ] starts from 2004 fg : 2004 you can come to the opening i 'll invite you no but the issue of city building in democracy is interesting because it creates chaos right everybody doing their thing makes a very chaotic environment and if you can figure out how to work off each other -- if you can get a bunch of people who respect each other 's work and play off each other you might be able to create models for how to build sections of the city without resorting to the one architect like the rockefeller center model which is kind of from another era rsw : i found the most remarkable thing my preconception of bilbao was this wonderful building you go inside and there 'd be extraordinary spaces i 'd seen drawings you had presented here at ted the surprise of bilbao was in its context to the city that was the surprise of going across the river of going on the highway around it of walking down the street and finding it that was the real surprise of bilbao fg : but you know richard most architects when they present their work -- most of the people we know you get up and you talk about your work and it 's almost like you tell everybody you 're a good guy by saying " look i 'm worried about the context i 'm worried about the city i 'm worried about my client i worry about budget that i 'm on time " blah blah blah and all that stuff and it 's like cleansing yourself so that you can â€¦ by saying all that it means your work is good somehow and i think everybody -- i mean that should be a matter of fact like gravity you 're not going to defy gravity you 've got to work with the building department if you do n't meet the budgets you 're not going to get much work if it leaks -- bilbao did not leak i was so proud the mit project -- they were interviewing me for mit and they sent their facilities people to bilbao i met them in bilbao they came for three days rsw : this is the computer building fg : yeah the computer building they were there three days and it rained every day and they kept walking around -- i noticed they were looking under things and looking for things and they wanted to know where the buckets were hidden you know people put buckets out â€¦ i was clean there was n't a bloody leak in the place it was just fantastic but you 've got to -- yeah well up until then every building leaked so this â€¦ rsw : frank had a sort of â€¦ fg : ask miriam ! rw : â€¦ sort of had a fame his fame was built on that in l.a. for a while fg : you 've all heard the frank lloyd wright story when the woman called and said " mr. wright i 'm sitting on the couch and the water 's pouring in on my head " and he said " madam move your chair " so some years later i was doing a building a little house on the beach for norton simon and his secretary who was kind of a hell on wheels type lady called me and said " mr. simon 's sitting at his desk and the water 's coming in on his head " and i told her the frank lloyd wright story rsw : did n't get a laugh fg : no not now either but my point is that â€¦ and i call it the " then what " ok you solved all the problems you did all the stuff you made nice you loved your clients you loved the city you 're a good guy you 're a good person â€¦ and then what what do you bring to it and i think that 's what i 've always been interested in is that -- which is a personal kind of expression bilbao i think shows that you can have that kind of personal expression and still touch all the bases that are necessary of fitting into the city that 's what reminded me of it and i think that 's the issue you know ; it 's the " then what " that most clients who hire architects -- most clients are n't hiring architects for that they 're hiring them to get it done get it on budget be polite and they 're missing out on the real value of an architect rsw : at a certain point a number of years ago people -- when michael graves was a fashion before teapots â€¦ fg : i did a teapot and nobody bought it rsw : did it leak fg : no rsw : â€¦ people wanted a michael graves building is that a curse that people want a bilbao building fg : yeah since bilbao opened which is now four five years both krens and i have been called with at least 100 opportunities -- china brazil other parts of spain -- to come in and do the bilbao effect and i 've met with some of these people usually i say no right away but some of them come with pedigree and they sound well-intentioned and they get you for at least one or two meetings in one case i flew all the way to malaga with a team because the thing was signed with seals and various very official seals from the city and that they wanted me to come and do a building in their port i asked them what kind of building it was " when you get here we 'll explain it " blah blah blah so four of us went and they took us -- they put us up in a great hotel and we were looking over the bay and then they took us in a boat out in the water and showed us all these sights in the harbor each one was more beautiful than the other and then we were going to have lunch with the mayor and we were going to have dinner with the most important people in malaga just before going to lunch with the mayor we went to the harbor commissioner it was a table as long as this carpet and the harbor commissioner was here and i was here and my guys we sat down and we had a drink of water and everybody was quiet and the guy looked at me and said " now what can i do for you mr gehry " rsw : oh my god fg : so i got up i said to my team " let 's get out of here " we stood up we walked out they followed -- the guy that dragged us there followed us and he said " you mean you 're not going to have lunch with the mayor " i said " nope " " you 're not going to have dinner at all " they just brought us there to hustle this group you know to create a project and we get a lot of that luckily i 'm old enough that i can complain i ca n't travel i do n't have my own plane yet rsw : well i 'm going to wind this up and wind up the meeting because it 's been very long but let me just say a couple words fg : can i say something are you going to talk about me or you rsw : once a shit always a shit ! fg : because i want to get a standing ovation like everybody so â€¦ rsw : you 're going to get one ! you 're going to get one ! i 'm going to make it for you ! fg : no no wait a minute ! as you pointed out every time you come here you learn something this morning the world 's experts from i guess three or four different companies on building seats i think concluded that ultimately the solution is people should n't sit down i could have told them that yesterday the automotive guys gave us some new insights they pointed out that i believe it was between 30 and 50 years from today they will be steering cars by wire without all that mechanical stuff that 's reassuring they then pointed out that there 'd be sort of the other controls by wire to get rid of all that mechanical stuff that 's pretty good but why not get rid of the wires then you do n't need anything to control the car except thinking about it i would love to talk about the technology and sometime in what 's past the 15 minutes i 'll be happy to talk to all the techno-geeks around here about what 's in here but if i had one thing to say about this before we get to first it would be that from the time we started building this the big idea was n't the technology it really was a big idea in technology when we started applying it in the ibot for the disabled community the big idea here is i think a new piece of a solution to a fairly big problem in transportation and maybe to put that in perspective : there 's so much data on this i 'll be happy to give it to you in different forms you never know what strikes the fancy of whom but everybody is perfectly willing to believe the car changed the world and henry ford just about 100 years ago started cranking out model ts what i do n't think most people think about is the context of how technology is applied for instance in that time 91 percent of america lived either on farms or in small towns so the car -- the horseless carriage that replaced the horse and carriage -- was a big deal ; it went twice as fast as a horse and carriage it was half as long and it was an environmental improvement because for instance in 1903 they outlawed horses and buggies in downtown manhattan because you can imagine what the roads look like when you have a million horses and a million of them urinating and doing other things and the typhoid and other problems created were almost unimaginable so the car was the clean environmental alternative to a horse and buggy it also was a way for people to get from their farm to a farm or their farm to a town or from a town to a city it all made sense with 91 percent of the people living there by the 1950s we started connecting all the towns together with what a lot of people claim is the eighth wonder of the world the highway system and it is certainly a wonder and by the way as i take shots at old technologies i want to assure everybody and particularly the automotive industry -- who 's been very supportive of us -- that i do n't think this in any way competes with airplanes or cars but think about where the world is today 50 percent of the global population now lives in cities that 's 3.2 billion people we 've solved all the transportation problems that have changed the world to get it to where we are today 500 years ago sailing ships started getting reliable enough ; we found a new continent 150 years ago locomotives got efficient enough steam power that we turned the continent into a country over the last hundred years we started building cars and then over the 50 years we 've connected every city to every other city in an extraordinarily efficient way and we have a very high standard of living as a consequence of that but during that entire process more and more people have been born and more and more people are moving to cities china alone is going to move four to six hundred million people into cities in the next decade and a half and so nobody i think would argue that airplanes in the last 50 years have turned the continent and the country now into a neighborhood and if you just look at how technology has been applied we 've solved all the long-range high-speed high-volume large-weight problems of moving things around nobody would want to give them up and i certainly would n't want to give up my airplane or my helicopter or my humvee or my porsche i love them all i do n't keep any of them in my living room the fact is the last mile is the problem and half the world now lives in dense cities and people spend depending on who they are between 90 and 95 percent of their energy getting around on foot i think there 's -- i do n't know what data would impress you but how about 43 percent of the refined fuel produced in the world is consumed by cars in metropolitan areas in the united states three million people die every year in cities due to bad air and almost all particulate pollution on this planet is produced by transportation devices particularly sitting in cities and again i say that not to attack any industry i think -- i really do -- i love my airplane and cars on highways moving 60 miles an hour are extraordinarily efficient both from an engineering point of view an energy consumption point of view and a utility point of view and we all love our cars and i do the problem is you get into the city and you want to go four blocks it 's neither fun nor efficient nor productive it 's not sustainable if -- in china in the year 1998 417 million people used bicycles ; 1.7 million people used cars if five percent of that population became quote middle class and wanted to go the way we 've gone in the last hundred years at the same time that 50 percent of their population are moving into cities of the size and density of manhattan every six weeks -- it is n't sustainable environmentally ; it is n't sustainable economically -- there just ai n't enough oil -- and it 's not sustainable politically i mean what are we fighting over right now we can make it complicated but what 's the world fighting over right now so it seemed to me that somebody had to work on that last mile and it was dumb luck we were working on ibots but once we made this we instantly decided it could be a great alternative to jet skis you do n't need the water or snowmobiles you do n't need the snow or skiing it 's just fun and people love to move around doing fun things and every one of those industries by the way -- just golf carts alone is a multi-billion-dollar industry but rather than go license this off which is what we normally do it seemed to me that if we put all our effort not into the technology but into an understanding of a world that 's solved all its other problems but has somehow come to accept that cities -- which right back from ancient greece on were meant to walk around cities that were architected and built for people -- now have a footprint that while we 've solved every other transportation problem -- and it 's like moore 's law i mean look at the time it took to cross a continent in a conestoga wagon then on a railroad then an airplane every other form of transportation 's been improved in 5,000 years we 've gone backwards in getting around cities they 've gotten bigger ; they 're spread out the most expensive real estate on this planet in every city -- wilshire boulevard or fifth avenue or tokyo or paris -- the most expensive real estate is their downtowns 65 percent of the landmass of our cities are parked cars the 20 largest cities in the world so you wonder what if cities could give to their pedestrians what we take for granted as we now go between cities what if you could make them fun attractive clean environmentally friendly what if it would make it a little bit more palatable to have access via this as that last link to mass transit to get out to your cars so we can all live in the suburbs and use our cars the way we want and then have our cities energized again we thought it would be really neat to do that and one of the problems we really were worried about is : how do we get legal on the sidewalk because technically i 've got motors ; i 've got wheels -- i 'm a motor vehicle i do n't look like a motor vehicle i have the same footprint as a pedestrian ; i have the same unique capability to deal with other pedestrians in a crowded space i took this down to ground zero and knocked my way through crowds for an hour i 'm a pedestrian but the law typically lags technology by a generation or two and if we get told we do n't belong on the sidewalk we have two choices we 're a recreational vehicle that does n't really matter and i do n't spend my time doing that kind of stuff or maybe we should be out in the street in front of a greyhound bus or a vehicle we 've been so concerned about that we went to the postmaster general of the united states as the first person we ever showed on the outside and said " put your people on it everybody trusts their postman and they belong on the sidewalks and they 'll use it seriously " he agreed we went to a number of police departments that want their police officers back in the neighborhood on the beat carrying 70 pounds of stuff they love it and i ca n't believe a policeman is going to give themselves a ticket so we 've been working really really hard but we knew that the technology would not be as hard to develop as an attitude about what 's important and how to apply the technology we went out and we found some visionary people with enough money to let us design and build these things and in hopefully enough time to get them accepted so i 'm happy really i am happy to talk about this technology as much as you want and yes it 's really fun and yes you should all go out and try it but if i could ask you to do one thing it 's not to think about it as a piece of technology but just imagine that although we all understand somehow that it 's reasonable that we use our 4,000-pound machine which can go 60 miles an hour that can bring you everywhere you want to go and somehow it 's also what we used for the last mile and it 's broken and it does n't work one of the more exciting things that occurred to us about why it might get accepted happened out here in california a few weeks ago after we launched it we were here with a news crew on venice beach zipping up and back and he 's marveling at the technology and meanwhile bicycles are zipping by and skateboarders are zipping by and a little old lady -- i mean if you looked in the dictionary a little old lady -- came by me -- and now that i 'm on this i 'm the height of a normal adult now -- and she just stops and the camera is there and she looks up at me and says " can i try that " and what was i -- you know how are you going to say anything and so i said " sure " so i get off and she gets on and with a little bit of the usual ah then she turns around and she goes about 20 feet and she turns back around and she 's all smiles and she comes back to me and she stops and she says " finally they made something for us " and the camera is looking down at her i 'm thinking " wow that was great -- -- please lady do n't say another word " and the camera is down at her and this guy has to put the microphone in her face said " what do you mean by that " and i figured " it 's all over now " and she looks up and she says " well " she 's still watching these guys go ; she says " i ca n't ride a bike " no she says " i ca n't use a skateboard and i 've never used roller blades " she knew them by name ; she says " and it 's been 50 years since i rode a bicycle " then she looks up she 's looking up and she says " and i 'm 81 years old and i do n't drive a car anymore i still have to get to the store and i ca n't carry a lot of things " and it suddenly occurred to me that among my many fears were not just that the bureaucracy and the regulators and the legislators might not get it -- it was that fundamentally you believe there 's pressure among the people not to invade the most precious little bit of space left the sidewalks in these cities when you look at the 36 inches of legal requirement for sidewalk then the eight foot for the parked car then the three lanes and then the other eight feet -- it 's -- that little piece is all that 's there but she looks up and says this and it occurs to me well kids are n't going to mind these things and they do n't vote and business people and then young adults are n't going to mind these things -- they 're pretty cool -- so i guess subliminally i was worried that it 's the older population that 's going to worry so having seen this and having worried about it for eight years the first thing i do is pick up my phone and ask our marketing and regulatory guys call aarp get an appointment right away we 've got to show them this thing and they took it to washington ; they showed them ; and they 're going to be involved now watching how these things get absorbed in a number of cities like atlanta where we 're doing trials to see if it really can in fact help re-energize their downtown the bottom line is whether you believe the united nations or any of the other think tanks -- in the next 20 years all human population growth on this planet will be in cities in asia alone it will be over a billion people they learned to start with cell phones they did n't have to take the 100-year trip we took they start at the top of the technology food chain we 've got to start building cities and human environments where a 150-pound person can go a couple of miles in a dense rich green-space environment without being in a 4,000-pound machine to do it cars were not meant for parallel parking ; they 're wonderful machines to go between cities but just think about it : we 've solved all the long-range high-speed problems the greeks went from the theater of dionysus to the parthenon in their sandals you do it in your sneakers not much has changed if this thing goes only three times as fast as walking -- three times -- a 30-minute walk becomes 10 minutes your choice when living in a city if it 's now 10 minutes -- because at 30 minutes you want an alternative whether it 's a bus a train -- we 've got to build an infrastructure -- a light rail -- or you 're going to keep parking those cars but if you could put a pin in most cities and imagine how far you could if you had the time walk in one half-hour it 's the city if you could make it fun and make it eight or 10 minutes you ca n't find your car un-park your car move your car re-park your car and go somewhere ; you ca n't get to a cab or a subway we could change the way people allocate their resources the way this planet uses its energy make it more fun and we 're hoping to some extent history will say we were right that 's segway this is a stirling cycle engine ; this had been confused by a lot of things we 're doing this little beast right now is producing a few hundred watts of electricity yes it could be attached to this and yes on a kilogram of propane you could drive from new york to boston if you so choose perhaps more interesting about this little engine is it 'll burn any fuel because some of you might be skeptical about the capability of this to have an impact where most of the world you ca n't simply plug into your 120-volt outlet we 've been working on this actually as an alternative energy source starting way back with johnson & amp ; johnson to run an ibot because the best batteries you could get -- 10 watt-hours per kilogram in lead 20 watt-hours per kilogram nickel-cadmium 40 watt-hours per kilogram in nickel-metal hydride 60 watt-hours per kilogram in lithium 8,750 watt-hours of energy in every kilogram of propane or gasoline -- which is why nobody drives electric cars but in any event if you can burn it with the same efficiency -- because it 's external combustion -- as your kitchen stove if you can burn any fuel it turns out to be pretty neat it makes just enough electricity to for instance do this which at night is enough electricity in the rest of the world as mr. holly -- dr. holly -- pointed out can run computers and a light bulb but more interestingly the thermodynamics of this say you 're never going to get more than 20 percent efficiency it does n't matter much -- it says if you get 200 watts of electricity you 'll get 700 or 800 watts of heat if you wanted to boil water and re-condense it at a rate of 10 gallons an hour it takes about 25 a little over 25.3 kilowatt -- 25,000 watts of continuous power -- to do it that 's so much energy you could n't afford to desalinate or clean water in this country that way certainly in the rest of the world your choice is to devastate the place turning everything that will burn into heat or drink the water that 's available the number one cause of death on this planet among humans is bad water depending on whose numbers you believe it 's between 60 and 85,000 people per day we do n't need sophisticated heart transplants around the world we need water and women should n't have to spend four hours a day looking for it or watching their kids die we figured out how to put a vapor-compression distiller on this thing with a counter-flow heat exchanger to take the waste heat then using a little bit of the electricity control that process and for 450 watts which is a little more than half of its waste heat it will make 10 gallons an hour of distilled water from anything that comes into it to cool it so if we put this box on here in a few years could we have a solution to transportation electricity and communication and maybe drinkable water in a sustainable package that weighs 60 pounds i do n't know but we 'll try it i better shut up over the past couple of days as i 've been preparing for my speech i 've become more and more nervous about what i 'm going to say and about being on the same stage as all these fascinating people being on the same stage as al gore who was the first person i ever voted for and -- so i was getting pretty nervous and you know i did n't know that chris sits on the stage and that 's more nerve wracking but then i started thinking about my family i started thinking about my father and my grandfather and my great-grandfather and i realized that i had all of these teds going through my blood stream -- -- that i had to consider this " my element " so who am i chris kind of mentioned i started a company with my husband we have about 125 people internationally if you looked in the book you saw this which i really was appalled by and because i wanted to impress you all with slides since i saw the great presentations yesterday with graphs i made a graph that moves and i talk about the makeup of me so besides this freakish thing this is my science slide this is math and this is science ; this is genetics this is my grandmother and this is where i get this mouth i 'm a blogger which probably to a lot of you means different things you may have heard about the kryptonite lock brouhaha where a blogger talked about how you hack or break into a kryptonite lock using a ballpoint pen and it spread all over kryptonite had to adjust the lock and they had to address it to avoid too many customer concerns you may have heard about rathergate which was basically the result of bloggers realizing that the " th " in 111 is not typesetted on an old typewriter ; it 's on word bloggers exposed this or they worked hard to expose this you know blogs are scary this is what you see i see this and i 'm sure scared -- and i swear on stage -- shitless about blogs because this is not something that 's friendly but there are blogs that are changing the way we read news and consume media and you know these are great examples these people are reaching thousands if not millions of readers and that 's incredibly important during the hurricane you had msnbc posting about the hurricane on their blog updating it frequently this was possible because of the easy nature of blogging tools you have my friend who has a blog on digital -- on pdrs personal recorders he makes enough money just by running ads to support his family up in oregon that 's all he does now and this is something that blogs have made possible it 's a wonderful organization of people and doctors who go to developing nations to offer plastic surgery to those who need it children with cleft palates will get it and they document their story this is wonderful i am not that caring i talk about myself that 's what i am i 'm a blogger i have always decided that i was going to be an expert on one thing and i am an expert on this person and so i write about it and -- the short story about my blog : it started in 2001 i was 23 i was n't happy with my job because i was a designer but i was n't being really stimulated i was an english major in college i did n't have any use for it but i missed writing so i started to write a blog and i started to create things like these little stories this was an illustration about my camp experience when i was 11 years old and how i went to a ymca camp -- christian camp -- and basically by the end i had made my friends hate me so much that i hid in a bunk they could n't find me they sent a search party and i overheard people saying they wish i had killed myself jumped off bible peak you can laugh this is ok this is me this is what happened to me and when i started my blog it was really this one goal -- i said i am not going to be famous to the world but i could be famous to people on the internet and i set a goal i said " i 'm going to win an award " because i had never won an award in my entire life and i said " i 'm going to win this award -- the south by southwest weblog award " and i won it i reached all of these people and i had tens of thousands of people reading about my life everyday and then i wrote a post about a banjo i wrote a post about wanting to buy a banjo -- a $ 300 banjo which is a lot of money and i do n't play instruments ; i do n't know anything about music i like music and i like banjos and i think i probably heard steve martin playing and i said " i could do that " and i said to my husband i said " ben can i buy a banjo " and he 's like " no " and my husband -- this is my husband who is very hot -- he won an award for being hot -- -- he told me " you can not buy a banjo you 're just like your dad " who " collects " instruments and i wrote a post about how i was so mad at him ; he was such a tyrant because he would not let me buy this banjo and those people who know me understood my joke this is mena this is how i make a joke at people because the joke in this is that this person is not a tyrant : this person is so loving and so sweet that he lets me dress him up and post pictures of him to my blog and if he knew i was showing this right now -- i put this in today -- he would kill me but the thing was i wrote this and my friends read it and they 're like " oh that mena she wrote a post about you know wanting a stupid thing and being stupid " but i got emails from people that said " oh my god your husband is such an asshole how much money does he spend on beer in a year you could take that money and buy your banjo why do n't you open a separate account " i 've been with him since i was 17 years old we 've never had a separate bank account they said " separate your bank account -- spend your money ; spend his money that 's it " and then i got people saying " leave him " and -- i was like " ok what who are these people and why are they reading this " and i realized : i do n't want to reach these people i do n't want to write for this public audience and i started to kill my blog slowly i 'm like i do n't want to write this anymore and i slowly and slowly -- and i did tell personal stories from time to then i wrote this one and i put this up because of einstein today and i 'm going to get choked up because this is my first pet and she passed away two years ago and i decided to break from " i do n't really write about my public life " because i wanted to give her a little memorial but anyways it 's these sort of personal stories you know you read the blogs about politics or about media and gossip and all these things these are out there but it 's more of the personal that interests me and this is -- this is who i am you see norman rockwell and you have art critics say " norman rockwell is not art norman rockwell hangs in living rooms and bathrooms and this is not something to be considered high art " and i think this is one of the most important things to us as humans these things resonate with us and if you think about blogs you think of high art blogs the history paintings about you know all biblical stories and then you have this these are the blogs that interest me : the people who just tell stories one story is about this baby and his name is odin his father was a blogger and he was writing his blog one day and his wife gave birth to her baby at 25 weeks and he never expected this one day it was normal ; the next day it was hell and this is a one-pound baby so odin was documented every single day pictures were taken every day : day one day two â€¦ you have day nine -- they 're talking about his apnea ; day 39 -- he gets pneumonia his baby is so small and i 've never encountered such a just -- a disturbing image but just -- just so heartfelt you 're reading this as this happens so on day 55 everybody reads that he 's having failures : breathing failures and heart failures and it 's slowing down and you do n't know what to expect but then it gets better day 96 he goes home and you see this post that 's not something that you 're going to see in a paper or a magazine but this is something that this person feels and people are excited about it twenty-eight comments that 's not a huge amount of people reading but 28 people matter and today he is a healthy baby who if you read his blog -- it 's snowdeal.org his father 's blog -- he is taking pictures of him still because he is still his son and he is i think at his age level right now because he had received such great treatment from the hospital so blogs so what you 've probably heard these things before we talked about the well and we talked about all these sort of things throughout our online history but i think blogs are basically just an evolution and that 's where we are today it 's this record of who you are your persona you have your google search where you say " hey what is mena trott " and then you find these things and you 're happy or unhappy but then you also find people 's blogs and those are the records of people who are writing daily -- not necessarily about the same topic but things that interest them and we talk about the world flattens as being this panel and i am very optimistic whenever i think about blogs i 'm like " oh we 've got to reach all these people " millions and hundreds of millions and billions of people you know we 're getting into china we want to be there but you know there are so many people who wo n't have the access to write a blog but to see something like the $ 100 computer is amazing because it 's a -- blogging software is simple we have a successful company because of timing and because of perseverance but it 's simple stuff -- it 's not rocket science and so that 's an amazing thing to consider so the life record of a blog is something that i find incredibly important we started with a slide of my teds and i had to add this slide because i knew that the minute i showed this my mom -- my mom will see this deck somehow because she does read my blog -- and she 'll say " why was n't there a picture of me " this is my mom so i have all of the people that i know of but this is basically the extent of the family that i know in terms of my direct line i showed a norman rockwell painting before and this one i grew up with looking at constantly i would spend hours looking at just the connections saying " oh the little kid up at the top has red hair ; so does that first generation up there " and just these little things this is not science but this was enough for me to be really so interested in how we have evolved and how we can trace our line so that has always influenced me i have this record this 1910 census of another grabowski -- that 's my maiden name -- and there 's a theodore because there 's always a theodore this is all i have i have a couple of facts about somebody i have their date of birth and their age and what they did in their household if they spoke english and that 's it that 's all i know of these people and it 's pretty sad because i only go back five generations and then it 's it i do n't even know what happens on my mom 's side because she 's from cuba and i do n't have that many things and just doing this i spent time in the archives -- that 's another thing why my husband 's a saint -- i spent time in the washington archives just sitting there looking for these things now it 's online but he sat through that and so you have this record and you know this is my great-great-grandmother this is the only picture i have and to think of what we have the ability to do with our blogs ; to think about the people who are on those $ 100 computers talking about who they are sharing these personal stories -- this is an amazing thing another photo that has greatly influenced me or a series of photos is this project that 's done by an argentinean man and his wife and he 's basically taking a picture of his family everyday for the past what is '76 -- 20 oh my god i 'm '77 -- 29 years twenty-nine years there was a joke originally about my graph that i left out which is : you see all this math i 'm just happy i was able to add it up to 100 because that 's my skill set so you have these people aging and now this is them today or last year and that 's a powerful thing to have to be able to track this i wish that i would have this of my family i know that one day my children will be wondering -- or my grandchildren or my great-grandchildren if i ever have children -- what i am going to -- who i was so i do something that 's very narcissistic : i am a blogger -- that is an amazing thing for me because it captures a moment in time everyday i take a picture of myself -- i 've been doing this since last year -- every single day and you know it 's the same picture ; it 's basically the same person only a couple of people read it i do n't write this for this audience ; i 'm showing it now but i would go insane if this was really public about four people probably read it and they tell me you know " you have n't updated " -- i 'm probably going to get people telling me i have n't updated -- but this is something that 's amazing because i can go back to a day -- i can go back to april 2005 and say what was i doing this day i look at it i know exactly it 's this visual cue that is so important to what we do i put the bad pictures up too because there are bad pictures and i remember instantly : i am in germany in this -- i had to go for a one-day trip i was sick and i was in a hotel room and i wanted not to be there and so you see these things it 's not just always smiling now i 've kind of evolved it so i have this look if you look at my driver 's license i have the same look and it 's -- it 's -- a pretty disturbing thing but it 's something that is really important and the last story i really want to tell is this story because this is probably the one that means the most to me in all of what i 'm doing and i 'll probably get choked up because i tend to when i talk about this so this woman her name was emma and she was a blogger on our service typepad and she was a beta tester so she was there right when we opened -- you know there were 100 people -- and she wrote about her life dealing with cancer she was writing and writing and writing and we all started reading it because we had so few blogs on the service we could keep track of everyone and she was writing one day and you know then she disappeared for a little bit and her sister came on and she said that emma had passed away and all of our support staff who had talked to her were really emotional and it was a very hard day at the company and this was one of those instances where i realized how much blogging affects our relationship and flattening this sort of world that this woman is in england and she lives -- she lived a life where she was talking about what she was doing but the big thing that really influenced us was her sister wrote to me and she said you know and she wrote on this blog that -- writing her blog during the last couple of months of her life was probably the best thing that had happened to her and being able to talk to people being able to share what was going on and being able to write and receive comments and that was amazing -- to be able to know that we had empowered that and that blogging was something that she felt comfortable doing and that the idea that blogging does n't have to be scary that we do n't always have to be attack of the blogs that we can be people who are open and wanting to help and talk to people that was an amazing thing and -- and so i printed out her -- or i sent a pdf of her blog to her family and they passed it out at her memorial service and even in her obituary they mentioned her blog because it was such a big part of her life and that 's a huge thing so this is her legacy and i think that my call to action to all of you is : you know think about blogs think about what they are think about what you 've thought of them and then actually do it because it 's something that is really going to change our lives so thank you i had requested slides kind of adamantly up till the -- pretty much last few days but was denied access to a slide projector i actually find them a lot more emotional -- -- and personal and the neat thing about a slide projector is you can actually focus the work unlike powerpoint and some other programs now i agree that you have to -- yeah there are certain concessions and you know if you use a slide projector you 're not able to have the bad type swing in from the back or the side or up or down but maybe that 's an o.k trade-off to trade that off for a focus it 's a thought just a thought and there 's something nice about slides getting stuck and the thing you really hope for is occasionally they burn up which we wo n't see tonight so with that let 's get the first slide up here this as many of you have probably guessed is a recently emptied beer can in portugal this -- i had just arrived in barcelona for the first time and i thought -- you know fly all night i looked up and i thought wow how clean you come into this major airport and they simply have a b i mean how nice is that everything 's gotten simpler in design and here 's this mega airport and god i just -- i took a picture i thought god that is the coolest thing i 've ever seen at an airport till a couple months later i went back to the same airport -- same plane i think -- and looked up and it said c it was only then that i realized it was simply a gate that i was coming into i 'm a big believer in the emotion of design and the message that 's sent before somebody begins to read before they get the rest of the information ; what is the emotional response they get to the product to the story to the painting -- whatever it is that area of design interests me the most and i think this for me is a real clear very simplified version of what i 'm talking about these are a couple of garage doors painted identical situated next to each other so here 's the first door you know you get the message you know it 's pretty clear take a look at the second door and see if there 's any different message o.k. which one would you park in front of same color same message same words the only thing that 's different is the expression that the individual door-owner here put into the piece -- and again which is the psycho-killer here yet it does n't say that ; it does n't need to say that i would probably park in front of the other one i 'm sure a lot of you are aware that graphic design has gotten a lot simpler in the last five years or so it 's gotten so simple that it 's already starting to kind of come back the other way again and get a little more expressive but i was in milan and saw this street sign and was very happy to see that apparently this idea of minimalism has even been translated by the graffiti artist and this graffiti artist has come along made this sign a little bit better and then moved on he did n't overpower it like they have a tendency to do this is for a book by " metropolis " i took some photos and this is a billboard in florida and either they had n't paid their rent or they did n't want to pay their rent again on the sign and the billboard people were too cheap to tear the whole sign down so they just teared out sections of it and i would argue that it 's possibly more effective than the original billboard in terms of getting your attention getting you to look over that way and hopefully you do n't stop and buy those awful pecan things -- stuckey 's this is from my second book the first book is called " the end of print " and it was done along with a film working with william burroughs and " the end of print " is now in its fifth printing when i first contacted william burroughs about being part of it he said no ; he said he did n't believe it was the end of print and i said well that 's fine ; i just would love to have your input on this film and this book and he finally agreed to it and at the end of the film he says in this great voice that i ca n't mimic but i 'll kind of try but not really he says " i remember attending an exhibition called 'photography : the end of painting ' " and then he says " and of course it was n't at all " so apparently when photography was perfected there were people going around saying that 's it : you 've just ruined painting people are just going to take pictures now and of course that was n't the case so this is from " 2nd sight " a book i did on intuition i think it 's not the only ingredient in design but possibly the most important it 's something everybody has it 's not a matter of teaching it ; in fact most of the schools tend to discount intuition as an ingredient of your working process because they ca n't quantify it : it 's very hard to teach people the four steps to intuitive design but we can teach you the four steps to a nice business card or a newsletter so it tends to get discounted this is a quote from albert einstein who says " the intellect has little to do on the road to discovery there comes a leap in consciousness -- call it intuition or what you will -- and the solution just comes to you and you do n't know from where or why " so it 's kind of like when somebody says who did that song and the more you try to think about it the further the answer gets from you and the minute you stop thinking about it your intuition gives you that answer in a sense i like this for a couple of reasons if you 've had any design courses they would teach you you ca n't read this i think you eventually can and more importantly i think it 's true " do n't mistake legibility for communication " just because something 's legible does n't means it communicates more importantly it does n't mean it communicates the right thing so what is the message sent before somebody actually gets into the material and i think that 's sometimes an overlooked area this is working with marshall mcluhan i stayed and worked with his wife and son eric and we came up with close to 600 quotes from marshall that are just amazing in terms of being ahead of the times predicting so much of what has happened in the advertising television media world and so this book is called " probes " it 's another word for quotes and it 's -- a lot of them are never -- have never been published before and basically i 've interpreted the different quotes so this was the contents page originally when i got done it was 540 pages and then the publisher gingko press ended up cutting it down considerably : it 's just under 400 pages now but i decided i liked this contents page -- i liked the way it looks -- so i kept it it now has no relevance to the book whatsoever but it 's a nice spread i think in there so a couple spreads from the book : here mcluhan says " the new media are not bridges between man and nature ; they are nature " " the invention of printing did away with anonymity fostering ideas of literary fame and the habit of considering intellectual effort as private property " which had never been done before printing " when new technologies impose themselves on societies long habituated to older technologies anxieties of all kinds result " " while people are engaged in creating a totally different world they always form vivid images of the preceding world " i hate this stuff it 's hard to read " people in the electronic age have no possible environment except the globe and no possible occupation except information gathering " that was it that 's all he saw as the options and not too far off so this is a project for nine inch nails and i only show it because it seemed like it got all this relevancy all of a sudden and it was done right after 9/11 and i had recently discovered a bomb shelter in the backyard of a house i had bought in la that the real estate person had n't pointed out there was some bomb shelter built apparently in the '60s cuban missile crisis and i asked the real estate guy what it was as we were walking by and he goes " it 's something to do with the sewage system " i was o.k ; that 's fine i finally went down there and it was this old rusted circular thing and two beds and very kind of creepy and weird and also surprisingly it was done in kind of a cheap metal and it had completely rusted through and water everywhere and spiders and i thought you know what were they thinking you 'd think maybe cement possibly or something but anyway i used this for a cover for the nine inch nails dvd and i 've also now fixed the bomb shelter with duct tape and it 's ready i think i 'm ready so this is an experiment really for a client quicksilver where we were taking what was a six-shot sequence and trying to use print as a medium to get people to the web so this is a six-shot sequence i 've taken one shot ; i cropped it a few different ways and then the tiny line of copy says if you want to see this entire sequence -- how this whole ride was -- go to the website and my guess is that a lot of the surf kids did go to the site to get this entire picture got no way of tracking it so i could be totally wrong i do n't have the site it 's just the piece itself this is a group in new york called the coalition for a smoke-free environment -- asked me to do these posters they were wild-posted around new york city you ca n't really -- well you ca n't see it at all -- but the second line is really the more kind of payoff in a sense it says " if the cigarette companies can lie then so can we " but -- -- but i did these were literally wild-posted all over new york one night and there were definitely some heads turning you know people smoking and " huh ! " and it was purposely done to look fairly serious it was n't some you know weird grunge type or something ; it looked like they might be real anyway poster for atlantic center for the arts a school in florida this amazes me this is a product i just found out i was in the caribbean at christmas and i 'm just blown away that in this day and age they will still sell -- not that they will sell -- that there is felt a need for people to lighten the color of their skin this was either an old product with new packaging or a brand-new package and i just thought yikes ! how 's that still happening i do a lot of workshops all over the world really and this particular assignment was to come up with new symbols for the restroom doors i felt this was one of the more successful solutions the students actually cut them up and put them up around bars and restaurants that night and i just always have this vision of this elderly couple going to use the restroom â€¦ i did some work for microsoft a few years back it was a worldwide branding campaign and it was interesting to me -- my background is in sociology ; i had no design training and sometimes people say well that explains it -- but it was a very interesting experiment because there 's no product that i had to sell ; it was simply the image of microsoft they were trying to improve they thought some people did n't like them i found out that 's very true working on this campaign worldwide and our goal was to try to humanize them a bit and what i did was add type and people to the ad which the previous campaign had not had and nobody remembered them and nobody referenced them and we were trying to say that hey some of these guys that work there are actually ok ; some of them actually have friends and family and they 're not all awful people and the umbrella campaign was " thank god it 's monday " so we tried to take this -- what was perceived as a negative : their over-competitiveness their you know long working hours -- and turn it into a positive and not run from it you know : thank god it 's monday -- i get to go back to that little cubicle those fake gray walls and hear everybody else 's conversations f or 10 hours and then go home but anyway this is one of the ads i was most pleased with because they were all elaborately art-directed and this one i thought actually felt like the girl was looking at the computer it says " wonder around " and then it 's a piece of the software and this is how the ad ran around the world in germany they made one small change without checking with me -- nor did they have to because it was done through agencies -- but see if you can tell the difference this is how the ad ran throughout the world ; germany made one slight change in the ad now there 's kind of two issues here if you 're going to put a kid in the ad pick one that looks alive i just have a feeling this kid 's been there for a week you know he 's just really hoping that boots up and you know â€¦ and then as the agency explained to me they said " look we do n't have little green people in our country ; why would we put little green people in our ads for instance " so i understand their logic i totally disagree with it ; i think it 's a very small-minded approach the world is certainly much more global and i certainly think the people of germany could have handled a little black girl sitting in front of a computer though we 'll never know this is some work from ray gun and the point of this magazine was to read the articles listen to the music and try to interpret it there 's no grid there 's no system there 's nothing set up in advance this is an opener for brian eno and it 's just kind of my personal interpretation of the music this is rockstars talking about teachers they had lusted after in school there 's a lot of great writing in " ray gun " and i was fortunate to find a photograph of a teacher sitting on some books article on bryan ferry -- just really boring article -- so i set the whole article in dingbat you could -- you could highlight it ; you could make it helvetica or something : it is the actual article i suppose you could eventually decode it but it 's really not very well written ; it really would n't be worthwhile having done a lot of magazines i 'm very curious how big magazines handle big stories and i was very curious to see how time and newsweek would handle 9/11 and i was basically pretty disappointed to see that they had chosen to show the photo we 'd already seen a million times which was basically the moment of impact and people magazine i thought got probably the best shot it 's kind of horsey type but the texture -- the second plane not quite hitting : there was something more enticing if that 's the right -- it 's not the right word -- but in this cover than time or newsweek but when i got into this magazine there 's something kind of disturbing and this continued on the left we see people dying ; we see people running for their lives and on the right we learn that there 's a new way to support your breast the coveted right-hand page was not given up to the whole issue look at the image of this lady -- who knows what she 's going through -- and the copy says : " he knows just how to give me goosebumps " yeah he jumps out of buildings it 's -- unfortunately this one works kind of as a spread and this continued through the entire magazine it did not let up this says : " one clean fits all " there were a lot of orphans made this day and here 's a dead body being brought out it just seems to me possibly even a blank page would have been more appropriate and this one i think is possibly the worst : two ladies both facing the same way both wearing jeans one -- who knows what she 's going through ; the other one is worried about model behavior and milk and -- i gave a talk in new york a couple months after this and afterwards somebody came up to me and they said that -- they actually emailed me -- and they said that they appreciated the talk and when they got back to their car they found a note on their car that made them think maybe new york was getting back to being new york again after this event -- it had been a few months this was what they found on their car there 's very few times you 'd be happy to find this on your car but it did seem to indicate that we were coming back this is my desktop somebody told me today there was this thing called folders but i do n't know what they are these are my notes for the talk -- there might be a correlation here we are wrapping up this i saw on the plane flying in for hot new products i 'm not sure this is an improvement or a good idea because like if you do n't spend quite enough time in front of your computer you can now get a plate in the keyboard so there 's no more faking it -- that you do n't really sit at your desk all day and eat and work anyway now there 's a plate and it would be really really convenient to get a piece of pizza then type a little bit then â€¦ i 'm just not sure this is improvement if you ever doubt the power of graphic design this is a very generic sign that literally says " vote for hitler " it says nothing else and this to me is an extreme case of the power of emotion of graphic design even though in fact was a very generic poster at the time what 's next what 's next is going to be people as we get more technically driven the importance of people becomes more than it 's ever been before you have to utilize who you are in your work nobody else can do that : nobody else can pull from your background from your parents your upbringing your whole life experience if you allow that to happen it 's really the only way you can do some unique work and you 're going to enjoy the work a lot more as well this is -- i like found art ; hand lettering 's coming back in a big way and i thought this was a great example of both this lady 's advertising for her lost pit bull it 's friendly -- she 's underlined friendly -- that 's probably why she calls it hercules or hercles she ca n't spell but more importantly she 's willing to give you 20 bucks to go find this lost pit bull and i 'm thinking yeah right i 'll go look for a lost pit bill for 20 bucks i have visions of people going down alleyways yelling out for hercles and you get charged by this thing and you go oh please be hercles ; please be the friendly one i 'm sure she never found the dog because i took the sign but i was asked to give a talk at a conference in sacramento a few years back and the theme was courage and they asked me to talk about how courageous it is to be a graphic designer and i remembered seeing this photograph of my father who was a test pilot and he told me that when you signed up to become a test pilot they told you that there was a 40 to 50 percent chance of death on the job that 's pretty high for most occupations but you know the government would make a plane ; they 'd say go see if that one flies would you some of them did ; some of them did n't and i started thinking about some of these decisions i have to make between like serif versus san-serif and for the most part they 're not real life-threatening why not experiment why not have some fun why not put some of yourself into the work and when i was teaching i used to always ask the students what 's the definition of a good job and as teachers after you get all the answers you like to give them the correct answer and the best one i 've heard -- i 'm sure some of you have heard this -- the definition of a good job is : if you could afford to -- if money was n't an issue -- would you be doing that same work and if you would you 've got a great job and if you would n't what the heck are you doing you 're going to be dead a really long time thank you very much i should tell you that when i was asked to be here i thought to myself that well it 's ted and these tedsters are -- you know as innocent as that name sounds -- these are the philanthropists and artists and scientists who sort of shape our world and what could i possibly have to say that would be distinguished enough to justify my participation in something like that and so i thought perhaps a really civilized-sounding british accent might help things a bit and then i thought no no i should just get up there and be myself and just talk the way i really talk because after all this is the great unveiling and so i thought i 'd come up here and unveil my real voice to you although many of you already know that i do speak the queen 's english because i am from queens new york but the theme of this session of course is invention and while i do n't have any patents that i 'm aware of you will be meeting a few of my inventions today i suppose it 's fair to say that i am interested in the invention of self or selves we 're all born into certain circumstances with particular physical traits unique developmental experiences geographical and historical contexts but then what to what extent do we self-construct do we self-invent how do we self-identify and how mutable is that identity like what if one could be anyone at any time well my characters like the ones in my shows allow me to play with the spaces between those questions and so i 've brought a couple of them with me and well they 're very excited what i should tell you -- what i should tell you is that they 've each prepared their own little ted talks so feel free to think of this as sarah university okay okay oh well oh wonderful good evening everybody thank you so very much for having me here today ah thank you very much my name is lorraine levine oh my ! there 's so many of you hi sweetheart okay anyway i am here because of a young girl sarah jones she 's a very nice young black girl well you know she calls herself black -- she 's really more like a caramel color if you look at her but anyway she has me here because she puts me in her show what she calls her one-woman show and you know what that means of course that means she takes the credit and then makes us come out here and do all the work but i do n't mind frankly i 'm kvelling just to be here with all the luminaries you have attending something like this you know really it 's amazing not only of course the scientists and all the wonderful giants of the industries but the celebrities there are so many celebrities running around here i saw -- glenn close i saw earlier i love her and she was getting a yogurt in the google cafe is n't that adorable so many others you see they 're just wonderful it 's lovely to know they 're concerned you know and -- oh i saw goldie hawn oh goldie hawn i love her too ; she 's wonderful yeah you know she 's only half jewish did you know that about her yeah but even so a wonderful talent and i -- you know when i saw her such a wonderful feeling yeah she 's lovely but anyway i should have started by saying just how lucky i feel it 's such an eye-opening experience to be here you 're all so responsible for this world that we live in today you know i could n't have dreamed of such a thing as a young girl and you 've all made these advancements happen in such a short time -- you 're all so young you know your parents must be very proud but i -- i also appreciate the diversity that you have here i noticed it 's very multicultural you know when you 're standing up here you can see all the different people it 's like a rainbow it 's okay to say rainbow yeah i just -- i ca n't keep up with whether you can say you know the different things what are you allowed to say or not say i just -- i do n't want to offend anybody you know but anyway you know i just think that to be here with all of you accomplished young people -- literally some of you the architects building our brighter future you know it 's heartening to me even though quite frankly some of your presentations are horrifying absolutely horrifying it 's true it 's true you know between the environmental degradation and the crashing of the world markets you 're talking about and of course we know it 's all because of the -- all the â€¦ well i do n't know how else to say it to you so i 'll just say it my way : the ganeyvish schticklich coming from the governments and the you know the bankers and the wall street you know it anyway the point is i 'm happy somebody has practical ideas to get us out of this mess so i salute each of you and your stellar achievements thank you for all that you do and congratulations on being such big makhers that you 've become ted meisters so happy continued success congratulations mazel tov hi hi thank you everybody sorry this is such a wonderful opportunity and everything to be here right now my name is noraida and i 'm just -- i 'm so thrilled to be part of like your ted conference that you 're doing and everything like that i am dominican-american actually you could say i grew up in the capital of dominican republic otherwise known as washington heights in new york city but i do n't know if there 's any other dominican people here but i know that juan enriquez he was here yesterday and i think he 's mexican so that 's -- honestly that 's close enough for me right now so -- i just -- i 'm sorry i 'm just trying not to be nervous because this is a very wonderful experience for me and everything and i just -- you know i 'm not used to doing the public speaking and whenever i get nervous i start to talk really fast nobody can understand nothing i 'm saying which is very frustrating for me as you can imagine i usually have to just like try to calm down and take a deep breath but then on top of that you know sarah jones told me we only have 18 minutes so then i 'm like should i be nervous you know because maybe it 's better and i 'm just trying not to panic and freak out so i like take a deep breath okay sorry so anyway what i was trying to say is that i really love ted like i love everything about this it 's amazing like it 's -- i ca n't get over this right now and like people would not believe seriously where i 'm from that this even exists you know like even i mean i love like the name the -- ted i mean i know it 's a real person and everything but i 'm just saying that like you know i think it 's very cool how it 's also an acronym you know which is like you know is like very high concept and everything like that i like that and actually i can relate to the whole like acronym thing and everything because actually i 'm a sophomore at college right now at my school -- actually i was part of co-founding an organization which is like a leadership thing you know like you guys you would really like it and everything and the organization is called da bomb a\and da bomb -- not like what you guys can build and everything -- it 's like da bomb it means like dominican -- it 's an acronym -- dominican-american benevolent organization for mothers and babies so i know see like the name is like a little bit long but with the war on terror and everything the dean of student activities has asked us to stop saying da bomb and use the whole thing so nobody would get the wrong idea whatever so basically like da bomb -- what dominican-american benevolent organization for mothers and babies does is basically we try to advocate for students who show a lot of academic promise and who also happen to be mothers like me i am a working mother and i also go to school full-time and you know it 's like -- it 's so important to have like role models out there i mean i know sometimes our lifestyles are very different whatever but like even at my job -- like i just got promoted right now it 's very exciting actually for me because i 'm the junior assistant to the associate director under the senior vice president for business development -- that 's my new title so but i think whether you own your own company or you 're just starting out like me like something like this is so vital for people to just continue expanding their minds and learning and if everybody like all people really had access to that it would be a very different world out there as i know you know so i think all people we need that but especially i look at people like me you know like i mean latinos -- we 're about to be the majority in like two weeks so we deserve just as much to be part of the exchange of ideas as everybody else so i 'm very happy that you 're you know doing this kind of thing making the talks available online that 's very good i love that and i just -- i love you guys i love ted and if you do n't mind privately now in the future i 'm going to think of ted as an acronym for technology entertainment and dominicans thank you very much so that was noraida and just like lorraine and everybody else you 're meeting today these are folks who are based on real people from my real life : friends neighbors family members i come from a multicultural family in fact the older lady you just met : very very loosely based on a great aunt on my mother 's side it 's a long story believe me but on top of my family background my parents also sent me to the united nations school where i encountered a plethora of new characters including alexandre my french teacher okay well you know it was beginner french that i am taking with her you know and it was madame bousson you know she was very [ french ] it was like you know she was there in the class you know she was kind of typically french you know she was very chic but she was very filled with ennui you know and she would be there you know kind of talking with the class you know talking about the you know the existential futility of life you know and we were only 11 years old so it was not appropriate but [ german ] yes i took german for three years [ german ] and it was quite the experience because i was the only black girl in the class even in the un school although you know it was wonderful the teacher herr schtopf he never discriminated never he always always treated each of us you know equally unbearably during the class so there were the teachers and then there were my friends classmates from everywhere many of whom are still dear friends to this day and they 've inspired many characters as well for example a friend of mine well i just wanted to quickly say good evening my name is praveen manvi and thank you very much for this opportunity of course ted the reputation precedes itself all over the world but you know i am originally from india and i wanted to start by telling you that once sarah jones told me that we will be having the opportunity to come here to ted in california originally i was very pleased and frankly relieved because you know i am a human rights advocate and usually my work it takes me to washington d.c and there i must attend these meetings mingling with some tiresome politicians trying to make me feel comfortable by telling how often they are eating the curry in georgetown so you can just imagine -- right so but i 'm thrilled to be joining all of you here i wish we had more time together but that 's for another time okay great and sadly i do n't think we 'll have time for you to meet everybody i brought but -- i 'm trying to behave myself it 's my first time here but i do want to introduce you to a couple of folks you may recognize if you saw " bridge and tunnel " uh well thank you good evening my name is pauline ning and first i want to tell you that i 'm -- of course i am a member of the chinese community in new york but when sarah jones asked me to please come to ted i said well you know first i do n't know that you know -- before two years ago you would not find me in front of an audience of people much less like this because i did not like to give speeches because i feel that as an immigrant i do not have good english skills for speaking but then i decided just like governor arnold schwarzenegger i try anyway my daughter -- my daughter wrote that she told me " always start your speech with humor " but my background -- i want to tell you story only briefly my husband and i we brought our son and daughter here in 1980s to have the freedom we can not have in china at that time and we tried to teach our kids to be proud of their tradition but it 's very hard you know as immigrant i would speak chinese to them and they would always answer me back in english they love rock music pop culture american culture but when they got older when the time comes for them to start think about getting married that 's when we expect them to realize a little bit more their own culture but that 's where we had some problems my son he says he is not ready to get married and he has a sweetheart but she is american woman not chinese it 's not that it 's bad but i told him " what 's wrong with a chinese woman " but i think he will change his mind soon so then i decide instead i will concentrate on my daughter the daughter 's marriage is very special to the mom but first she said she 's not interested she only wants to spend time with her friends and then at college it 's like she never came home and she does n't want me to come and visit so i said " what 's wrong in this picture " so i accused my daughter to have like a secret boyfriend but she told me " mom you do n't have to worry about boys because i do n't like them " and i said " yes men can be difficult but all women have to get used to that " she said " no mom i mean i do n't like boys i like girls i am lesbian " so i always teach my kids to respect american ideas but i told my daughter that this is one exception -- -- that she is not gay she is just confused by this american problem but she told me " mom it 's not american " she said she is in love -- in love with a nice chinese girl so these are the words i am waiting to hear but from my son not my daughter but at first i did not know what to do but then over time i have come to understand that this is who she is so even though sometimes it 's still hard i will share with you that it helps me to realize society is more tolerant usually because of places like this because of ideas like this and people like you with an open mind so i think maybe ted you impact people 's lives in the ways maybe even you do n't realize so for my daughter 's sake i thank you for your ideas worth spreading thank you xie xie good evening my name is habbi belahal and i would like to first of all thank sarah jones for putting all of the pressure on the only arab who she brought with her to be last today i am originally from jordan and i teach comparative literature at queens college it is not harvard but i feel a bit like a fish out of water but i am very proud of my students and i see that a few of them did make it here to the conference so you will get the extra credit i promised you but while i know that i may not look like the typical ted-izen as you would say i do like to make the point that we in global society we are never as different as the appearances may suggest so if you will indulge me i will share quickly with you a bit of verse which i memorized as a young girl at 16 years of age so back in the ancient times [ arabic ] and this roughly translates : " please let me hold your hand i want to hold your hand i want to hold your hand and when i touch you i feel happy inside it 's such a feeling that my love i ca n't hide i ca n't hide i ca n't hide " well so okay but please please but please if it is sounding familiar it is because i was at the same time in my life listening to the beatles on the radio [ unclear ] they were very popular so all of that is to say that i like to believe that for every word intended as to render us deaf to one another there is always a lyric connecting ears and hearts across the continents in rhyme and i pray that this is the way that we will self-invent in time that 's all shukran thank you very much for the opportunity okay great thank you all very much it was lovely thank you for having me thank you very very much i love you well you have to let me say this i just -- thank you i want to thank chris and jacqueline and just everyone for having me here it 's been a long time coming and i feel like i 'm home and i know i 've performed for some of your companies or some of you have seen me elsewhere but this is honestly one of the best audiences i 've ever experienced the whole thing is amazing and so do n't you all go reinventing yourselves any time soon just to put everything in context and to kind of give you a background to where i 'm coming from so that a lot of the things i 'm going to say and the things i 'm going to do -- or things i 'm going to tell you i 've done -- you will understand exactly why and how i got motivated to be where i am i graduated high school in cleveland ohio 1975 and just like my parents did when they finished studying abroad we went back home finished university education got a medical degree 1986 and by the time i was an intern house officer i could barely afford to maintain my mother 's 13-year-old car -- and i was a paid doctor this brings us to why a lot of us who are professionals are now as they say in diaspora now are we going to make that a permanent thing where we all get trained and we leave and we do n't go back perhaps not i should certainly hope not -- because that is not my vision all right for good measure that 's where nigeria is on the african map and just there is the delta region that i 'm sure everybody 's heard of people getting kidnapped where the oil comes from the oil that sometimes i think has driven us all crazy in nigeria but critical poverty : this slide is from a presentation i gave not that long ago gapminder.org tells the story of the gap between africa and the rest of the world in terms of health care very interesting how many people do you think are on that taxi and believe it or not that is a taxi in nigeria and the capital -- well what used to be the capital of nigeria -- lagos that 's a taxi and you have police on them so tell me how many policemen do you think are on this taxi and now three so when these kind of people -- and believe me it 's not just the police that use these taxis in lagos we all do i 've been on one of these and i did n't have a helmet either and it just reminds me of the thought of what happens when one of us on a taxi like this falls off has an accident and needs a hospital believe it or not some of us do survive some of us do survive malaria ; we do survive aids and like i tell my family and my wife reminds me every time " you 're risking your life you know every time you go to that country " and she 's right every time you go there you know that if you actually need critical care -- critical care of any sort -- if you have an accident -- of which there are many there are accidents everywhere -- where do they go where do they go when they need help for this kind of stuff i 'm not saying instead of i 'm saying as well as aids tb malaria typhoid -- the list goes on i 'm saying where do they go when they 're like me when i go back home -- and i do all kinds of things i teach i train -- but i catch one of these things or i 'm chronically ill with one of those where do they go what 's the economic impact when one of them dies or becomes disabled i think it 's quite significant this is where they go these are not old pictures and these are not from some downtrodden -- this is a major hospital in fact it 's from a major teaching hospital in nigeria now that is less than a year old in an operating room that 's sterilizing equipment in nigeria you remember all that oil yes i 'm sorry if it upsets some of you but i think you need to see this that 's the floor ok you can say some of this is education you can say it 's hygiene i 'm not pleading poverty i 'm saying we need more than just you know vaccination malaria aids because i want to be treated in a proper hospital if something happens to me out there in fact when i start running around saying " hey boys and girls you 're cardiologists in the u.s. can you come home with me and do a mission " i want them to think " well there 's some hope " now have a look at that that 's the anesthesiology machine and that 's my specialty right anesthesiology and critical care -- look at that bag it 's been taped with tape that we even stopped using in the u.k and believe me these are current pictures now if something like this which has happened in the u.k. that 's where they go this is the intensive care unit in which i work all right this is a slide from a talk i gave about intensive care units in nigeria and jokingly we refer to it as " expensive scare " because it 's scary and it 's expensive but we need to have it ok so these are the problems there are no prizes for telling us what the problems are are there i think we all know and several speakers before and speakers after me are going to tell us even more problems these are a few of them so what did i do there we go -- we 're going on a mission we 're going to do some open-heart surgery i was the only brit on a team of about nine american cardiac surgeons cardiac nurse intensive care nurse we all went out and did a mission and we 've done three of them so far just so you know i do believe in missions i do believe in aid and i do believe in charity they have their place but where do they go for those things we talked about earlier because it 's not everyone that 's going to benefit from a mission health is wealth in the words of hans rosling you get wealthier faster if you are healthy first so here we are mission big trouble open-heart surgery in nigeria -- big trouble that 's mike mike comes out from mississippi does he look like he 's happy it took us two days just to organize the place but hey you know we worked on it does he look happy yes that 's the medical advice the committee chairman says " yes i told you you were n't going to be able to you ca n't do this i just know it " look that 's the technician we had so yes you go on all right i got him to come with me -- anesthesia tech -- come with me from the u.k yes let 's just go work this thing out see that 's one of the problems we have in nigeria and in africa generally we get a lot of donated equipment equipment that 's obsolete equipment that does n't quite work or it works and you ca n't fix it and there 's nothing wrong with that so long as we use it and we move on but we had problems with it we had severe problems there he had to get on the phone this guy was always on the phone so what we going to do now it looks like all these americans are here and yes one brit and he 's not going to do anything -- he thinks he 's british actually and he 's actually nigerian i just thought about that we eventually got it working is the truth but it was one of these even older than the one you saw the reason i have this picture here this x-ray it 's just to tell you where and how we were viewing x-rays do you figure where that is it was on a window i mean what 's an x-ray viewing box please well nowadays everything 's on pax anyway you look at your x-rays on a screen and you do stuff with them you email them but we were still using x-rays but we did n't even have a viewing box ! and we were doing open-heart surgery ok i know it 's not aids i know it 's not malaria but we still need this stuff oh yeah echo -- this was just to get the children ready and the adults ready people still believe in voodoo heart disease vsd hole in the heart tetralogies you still get people who believe in it and they came at 67 percent oxygen saturation the normal is about 97 her condition open-heart surgery that as she required would have been treated when she was a child we had to do these for adults so we did succeed and we still do we 've done three we 're planning another one in july in the north of the country so we certainly still do open-heart but you can see the contrast between everything that was shipped in -- we ship everything instruments we had explosions because the kit was designed and installed by people who were n't used to it the oxygen tanks did n't quite work right but how many did we do the first one 12 we did 12 open-heart surgical patients successfully here is our very first patient out of intensive care and just watch that chair all right this is what i mean about appropriate technology that 's what he was doing propping up the bed because the bed simply did n't work have you seen one of those before no yes does n't matter it worked i 'm sure you 've all seen or heard this before : " we the willing have been doing so much with so little for so long -- -- we are now qualified to do anything with nothing " thank you sustainable solutions -- this was my first company this one 's sole aim is to provide the very things that i think are missing so we put my hand in my pocket and say " guys let 's just buy stuff let 's go set up a company that teaches people educates them gives them the tools they need to keep going " and that 's a perfect example of one usually when you buy a ventilator in a hospital you buy a different one for children you buy a different one for transport this one will do everything and it will do it at half the price and does n't need compressed air if you 're in america and you do n't know about this one we do because we make it our duty to find out what 's appropriate technology for africa -- what 's appropriately priced does the job and we move on anesthesia machine : multi-parameter monitor operating lights suction this little unit here -- remember your little 12-volt plug in the car that charges your whatever game boy telephone that 's exactly how the outlets are designed yes it will take a solar panel yes a solar panel will charge it but if you 've got mains as well it will charge the batteries in there and guess what we have a little pedal charger too just in case and guess what if it all fails if you can find a car that 's still got a live battery and you stick it in it will still work then you can customize it is it dental surgery you want general surgery you want decide which instruments stock it up with consumables and currently we 're working on oxygen -- oxygen delivery on-site the technology for oxygen delivery is not new oxygen concentrators are very old technology what is new and what we will have in a few months i hope is that ability to use this same renewable energy system to provide and produce oxygen on site zeolite -- it 's not new -- zeolite removes nitrogen from air and nitrogen is 78 percent of air if you take nitrogen out what 's left oxygen pretty much so that 's not new what we 're doing is applying this technology to it these are the basic features of my device or our device this is what makes it so special apart from the awards it 's won it 's portable and it 's certified it 's registered the mhra -- and the ce mark for those who do n't know for europe is the equivalent of the fda in the u.s if you compare it with what 's on the market price-wise size-wise ease of use complexity â€¦ this picture was taken last year these are members of my graduating class 1986 it was in this gentleman 's house in the potomac for those of you who are familiar with maryland there are too many of us outside and everybody just to borrow a bit from hans -- hans rosling he 's my guy -- if the size of the text represents what gets the most attention it 's the problems but what we really need are african solutions that are appropriate for africa -- looking at the culture looking at the people looking at how much money they 've got african people because they will do it with a passion i hope and lots and lots of that little bit down there sacrifice you have to do it africans have to do it in conjunction with everyone else thank you so what 's image got do with it and i must say i think emeka is trying to send a lot of subliminal messages because i 'm going to keep harping on some of the issues that have come up but i 'm going to try and do something different and try and just close the loop with some of my personal stories and try and put a face to a lot of the issues that we 've been talking about so africa is a complex continent full of contradictions as you can see we 're not the only ones and you know it 's amazing i mean we need a whole conference just devoted to telling the good stories about the continent just think about that you know and this is typically what we 've been talking about the role that the media plays in focusing just on the negative stuff now why is that a problem a typical disaster story : disease corruption poverty and some of you might be standing here thinking saying " ok you know ory you 're harvard-educated and all you privileged people come here saying 'forget the poor people let 's focus on business and the markets and whatever ' " and they 're all " there 's the 80 percent of africans who really need help " and i want to tell you that this is my story ok and it 's the story of many of the africans who are here we start with poverty i did n't grow up in the slums or anything that dire but i know what it is to grow up without having money or being able to support family euvin was talking about bellwether signs the bellwether for whether our family was broke or not was breakfast you know when things were good we had eggs and sausages when things were bad we had porridge and like many african families my parents could never save because they supported siblings cousins you know their parents and things were always dicey now when i was born they realized they had a pretty smart kid and they did n't want me to go to the neighborhood school which was free and they adopted a very interesting approach to education which was they were going to take me to a school that they can barely afford so they took me to a private catholic elementary school which set the foundation for what ended up being my career and what happened was because they could afford it sometimes sometimes not i got kicked out pretty much every term you know someone would come in with a list of the people who have n't paid school fees and when they started getting pretty strict you had to leave until your school fees could be paid and i remember thinking i mean why do n't these guys just take me to a cheap school because you know as a kid you 're embarrassed and you 're sensitive and everyone knows you guys do n't have money but they kept at it and i now understand why they did what they did they talk about corruption in kenya we have an entrance exam to go into high school and there 's national schools which are like the best schools and provincial schools my dream school at that time was kenya high school a national school i missed the cutoff by one point and i was so disappointed and i was like " oh my god you know what am i going to do " and my father said " ok listen let 's go and try and talk to the headmistress you know it 's just one point i mean maybe she 'll let you in if that slot 's still there " so we went to the school and because we were nobodies and because we did n't have privilege and because my father did n't have the right last name he was treated like dirt and i sat and listened to the headmistress talk to him saying you know who do you think you are and you know you must be joking if you think you can get a slot and i had gone to school with other girls who were kids of politicians and who had done much much worse than i did and they had slots there and there 's nothing worse than seeing your parent being humiliated in front of you you know and we left and i swore to myself to beg for anything in my life " they called me two weeks later they 're like oh yeah you can come now and i told them to stuff it final story and i sort of have to speak quickly disease my father who i 've been talking about died of aids in 1999 he never told anyone that he had aids his fear of the stigma was so strong and i 'm pretty much the one who figured it out because i was a nerd and i was in the states at the time and they called me he was very sick the first time he got sick and he had cryptococcal meningitis and so i went on to google cryptococcal meningitis you know because of doctor-patient privilege they could n't really tell us what was going on but they were like you know this is a long-term thing and when i went online and looked at the infectious -- read about the disease i pretty much realized what was going on the first time he got sick he recovered but what happened was that he had to be on medication that at that time -- diflucan which in the states is used for yeast infections -- cost 30 dollars a pill he had to be on that pill for the rest of his life you know so money ran out he got sick again and up until that time he had a friend who used to travel to india and he used to import bring him could get him a generic version of it and that kept him going but the money ran out he got sick again he got sick on a friday at that time there was only one bank that had atms in kenya and we could not get cash the family could n't get cash for him to start the treatment until monday the hospital put him on a water drip for three days and finally we figured well ok we 'd better just try and take him to a public hospital at least he 'll get treated while we try to figure out the money situation and he died when the ambulance was coming to the hospital to take him and you know now imagine if -- and i could go on and on -- imagine if this is all you know about me how would you look at me with pity you know sadness and this is how you look at africa this is the damage it causes you do n't see the other side of me you do n't see the blogger you do n't see the harvard-educated lawyer the vibrant person you know and i just wanted to personalize that because we talk about it in big terms and you wonder you know so what but it 's damaging and i 'm not unique right imagine if all you knew about william was the fact that he grew up in a poor village and you did n't know about the windmill you know and i was just moved i was actually crying during his presentation he was like i try and i make i was like nike should hire him you know " just do it ! " and this is again the point i 'm trying to make when you focus just on the disasters -- -- we 're ignoring the potential so what is to be done first of all africans we need to get better at telling our stories we heard about that yesterday we had some of them this morning blogging is one way of doing that afrigator is an aggregator of african blogs that was developed in south africa so we need to start getting better if no one else will tell our stories let 's do it and going back to the point i was trying to make this is the swahili wikipedia swahili is spoken by about 50 million people in east africa it only has five contributors four of them are white males -- non-native speakers the other person is -- ndesanjo if you 're here stand up -- is a tanzanian [ the ] first swahili blogger he 's the only african who 's contributing to this people please we ca n't whine and complain the west is doing this what are we doing where are the rest of the swahili speakers why are we not generating our own content you know it 's not enough to complain we need to act reuters now integrates african blogs into their coverage of africa so that 's a start and we 've heard of all their other initiatives the cheetah generation the aid approach you know is flawed and after all the hoopla of live 8 we 're still not anywhere in the picture no you 're not but the point i 'm trying to make though is that it 's not enough for us to criticize and for those of you in the diaspora who are struggling with where should i be should i move back should i stay you know just jump the continent needs you and i ca n't emphasize that enough you know i walked away from a job with one of the top firms in d.c. covington and burling six figures with two paychecks or three paychecks i could solve a lot of my family 's problems but i walked away from that because my passion was here and because i wanted to do things that were fulfilling and because i 'm needed here you know i probably can win a prize for the most ways to use a harvard law school degree because of all the things i 'm doing one is because i 'm pretty aggressive and i try and find you know opportunities but there is such a need you know i 'm a corporate lawyer most of the time for an organization called enablis that supports entrepreneurs in south africa we 're now moving into east africa and we give them business development services as well as financing loan and equity i 've also set up a project in kenya and what we do is we track the performance of kenyan mps my partner m who 's a tech guru hacked wordpress it costs us like 20 dollars a month just for hosting everything else on there is a labor of love we 've manually entered all the data there and you can get profiles of each mp questions they 've asked in parliament we have a comment function where people can ask their mps questions there are some mps who participate and come back and ask and basically we started this because we were tired of complaining about our politicians you know i believe that accountability stems from demand you 're not just going to be accountable out of the goodness of your heart and we as africans need to start challenging our leaders what are they doing you know they 're not going to change just out of nowhere so we need new policies we need -- where 's that coming from you know another thing is that these leaders we talk about african governments like they 've been dropped from mars you know they come from us and what is it about our society that is generating leaders that we do n't like and how can we change that so mzalendo was one small way we thought we could start inspiring people to start holding their leaders accountable where do we go from here i believe in the power of ideas i believe in the power of sharing knowledge and i 'd ask all of you when you leave here please just share and keep the ideas that you 've gotten out of here going because it can make a difference the other thing i want to urge you to do is take an interest in the individual i 've had lots of conversations about things i think need to be happening in africa people are like " ok if you do n't do aid i 'm a bleeding heart liberal what can i do " and when i talk about my ideas they 're like " bbut it 's not scalable you know give me something i can do with paypal " it 's not that easy you know and sometimes just taking an interest in the individual in the fellows you 've met and the businesspeople you 've met it can make a huge difference especially in africa because usually the individual in africa carries a lot of people behind them practically i mean when i was a first-year student in law school my mom 's business had collapsed so i was supporting her my sister was struggling to get through undergrad i was helping her pay her tuition my cousin ran out of school fees and she 's really smart i was paying her school fees a cousin of mine died of aids left an orphan so we said well what are we going to do with her you know she 's now my baby sister and because of the opportunities that were afforded to me i am able to lift all those people so do n't underestimate that an example this man changed my life he 's a professor he 's now at vanderbilt he 's an undergrad professor mitchell seligson and because of him i got into harvard law school because he took an interest i was taking a class of his and he was just like this is an overeager student which we do n't normally get in the united states because everyone else is cynical and jaded he called me to his office and said " what do you want to do when you grow up " i said " i want to be a lawyer " and he was like " why you know we do n't need another lawyer in the united states " and he tried to talk me out of it but it was like " ok i know nothing about applying to law school i 'm poli-sci ph.d but you know let 's figure out what i need you to do what i need to do to help you out " it was like " where do you want to go " and to me at that time university -- i was at university of pitts for undergrad and that was like heaven ok because compared to what could have been in kenya so i 'm like " yeah i 'm just applying to pitt for law school " he was like " why you know you 're smart you have all these things going for you " and i 'm like " because i 'm here and it 's cheap and you know i kind of like pittsburgh " like that 's the dumbest reason i 've ever heard for applying to law school and you know so he took me under his wing and he encouraged me and he said " look you can get into harvard you 're that good ok and if they do n't admit you they 're the ones who are messed up " and he built me up you know and this is just an illustration you can meet other individuals here we just need a push that 's all i needed was a push to go to the next level basically i want to end with my vision for africa you know a gentleman spoke yesterday about the indignity of us having to leave the continent so that we can fulfill our potential you know my vision is that my daughter and any other african child being born today can be whoever they want to be here without having to leave and they can have the possibility of transcending the circumstances under which they were born that 's one thing you americans take for granted you know that you can grow up you know not so good circumstances and you can move just because you are born in rural arkansas whatever that does n't define who you are for most africans today where you live or where you were born and the circumstances under which you were born determine the rest of your life i would like to see that change and the change starts with us and as africans we need to take responsibility for our continent thank you my name is ursus wehrli and i would like to talk to you this morning about my project tidying up art first of all -- any questions so far first of all i have to say i 'm not from around here i 'm from a completely different cultural area maybe you noticed i mean i 'm wearing a tie first and then secondly i 'm a little bit nervous because i 'm speaking in a foreign language and i want to apologize in advance for any mistakes i might make because i 'm from switzerland and i just do n't hope you think this is swiss german i 'm speaking now here this is just what it sounds like if we swiss try to speak american but do n't worry -- i do n't have trouble with english as such i mean it 's not my problem it 's your language after all i am fine after this presentation here at ted i can simply go back to switzerland and you have to go on talking like this all the time so i 've been asked by the organizers to read from my book it 's called " tidying up art " and it 's as you can see it 's more or less a picture book so the reading would be over very quickly but since i 'm here at ted i decided to hold my talk here in a more modern way in the spirit of ted here and i managed to do some slides here for you i 'd like to show them around so we can just you know -- actually i managed to prepare for you some enlarged pictures -- even better so tidying up art i mean i have to say that 's a relatively new term you wo n't be familiar with it i mean it 's a hobby of mine that i 've been indulging in for the last few years and it all started out with this picture of the american artist donald baechler i had hanging at home i had to look at it every day and after a while i just could n't stand the mess anymore this guy was looking at all day long yeah i kind of felt sorry for him and it seemed to me even he felt really bad facing these unorganized red squares day after day so i decided to give him a little support and brought some order into neatly stacking the blocks on top of each other yeah and i think he looks now less miserable and it was great with this experience i started to look more closely at modern art then i realized how you know the world of modern art is particularly topsy-turvy and i can show here a very good example it 's actually a simple one but it 's a good one to start with it 's a picture by paul klee and we can see here very clearly it 's a confusion of color yeah the artist does n't really seem to know where to put the different colors the various pictures here of the various elements of the picture -- the whole thing is unstructured we do n't know maybe mr. klee was probably in a hurry i mean -- -- maybe he had to catch a plane or something we can see here he started out with orange and then he already ran out of orange and here we can see he decided to take a break for a square and i would like to show you here my tidied up version of this picture we can see now what was barely recognizable in the original : 17 red and orange squares are juxtaposed with just two green squares yeah that 's great so i mean that 's just tidying up for beginners i would like to show you here a picture which is a bit more advanced what can you say what a mess i mean you see everything seems to have been scattered aimlessly around the space if my room back home had looked like this my mother would have grounded me for three days so i 'd like to -- i wanted to reintroduce some structure into that picture and that 's really advanced tidying up yeah you 're right sometimes people clap at this point but that 's actually more in switzerland we swiss are famous for chocolate and cheese our trains run on time we are only happy when things are in order but to go on here is a very good example to see this is a picture by joan miro and yeah we can see the artist has drawn a few lines and shapes and dropped them any old way onto a yellow background and yeah it 's the sort of thing you produce when you 're doodling on the phone and this is my -- -- you can see now the whole thing takes up far less space it 's more economical and also more efficient with this method mr. miro could have saved canvas for another picture but i can see in your faces that you 're still a little bit skeptical so that you can just appreciate how serious i am about all this i brought along the patents the specifications for some of these works because i 've had my working methods patented at the eidgenÃ¶ssische amt fÃ¼r geistiges eigentum in bern switzerland i 'll just quote from the specification " laut den kunstprÃ¼fer dr. albrecht -- " it 's not finished yet " laut den kunstprÃ¼fer dr. albrecht gÃ¶tz von ohlenhusen wird die verfahrensweise rechtlich geschÃ¼tzt welche die kunst durch spezifisch aufgerÃ¤umte regelmÃ¤ssigkeiten des allgemeinen formenschatzes neue wirkungen zu erzielen mÃ¶glich wird " ja well i could have translated that but you would have been none the wiser i 'm not sure myself what it means but it sounds good anyway i just realized it 's important how one introduces new ideas to people that 's why these patents are sometimes necessary i would like to do a short test with you everyone is sitting in quite an orderly fashion here this morning so i would like to ask you all to raise your right hand yeah the right hand is the one we write with apart from the left-handers and now i 'll count to three i mean it still looks very orderly to me now i 'll count to three and on the count of three i 'd like you all to shake hands with the person behind you ok one two three you can see now that 's a good example : even behaving in an orderly systematic way can sometimes lead to complete chaos so we can also see that very clearly in this next painting this is a painting by the artist niki de saint phalle and i mean in the original it 's completely unclear to see what this tangle of colors and shapes is supposed to depict but in the tidied up version it 's plain to see that it 's a sunburnt woman playing volleyball yeah it 's a -- this one here that 's much better that 's a picture by keith haring i think it does n't matter so i mean this picture has not even got a proper title it 's called " untitled " and i think that 's appropriate so in the tidied-up version we have a sort of keith haring spare parts shop this is keith haring looked at statistically one can see here quite clearly you can see we have 25 pale green elements of which one is in the form of a circle or here for example we have 27 pink squares with only one pink curve i mean that 's interesting one could extend this sort of statistical analysis to cover all mr. haring 's various works in order to establish in which period the artist favored pale green circles or pink squares and the artist himself could also benefit from this sort of listing procedure by using it to estimate how many pots of paint he 's likely to need in the future one can obviously also make combinations for example with the keith haring circles and kandinsky 's dots you can add them to all the squares of paul klee in the end one has a list with which one then can arrange then you categorize it then you file it put that file in a filing cabinet put it in your office and you can make a living doing it yeah from my own experience so i 'm -- actually i mean here we have some artists that are a bit more structured it 's not too bad this is jasper johns we can see here he was practicing with his ruler but i think it could still benefit from more discipline and i think the whole thing adds up much better if you do it like this and here that 's one of my favorites tidying up rene magritte -- this is really fun you know there is a -- i 'm always being asked what inspired me to embark on all this it goes back to a time when i was very often staying in hotels so once i had the opportunity to stay in a ritzy five-star hotel and you know there you had this little sign -- i put this little sign outside the door every morning that read " please tidy room " i do n't know if you have them over here so actually my room there has n't been tidied once daily but three times a day so after a while i decided to have a little fun and before leaving the room each day i 'd scatter a few things around the space like books clothes toothbrush etc and it was great by the time i returned everything had always been neatly returned to its place but then one morning i hang the same little sign onto that picture by vincent van gogh and you have to say this room had n't been tidied up since 1888 and when i returned it looked like this yeah at least it is now possible to do some vacuuming ok i mean i can see there are always people that like reacting that one or another picture has n't been properly tidied up so we can make a short test with you this is a picture by rene magritte and i 'd like you all to inwardly -- like in your head that is -- to tidy that up so it 's possible that some of you would make it like this yeah i would actually prefer to do it more this way some people would make apple pie out of it but it 's a very good example to see that the whole work was more of a handicraft endeavor that involved the very time-consuming job of cutting out the various elements and sticking them back in new arrangements and it 's not done as many people imagine with the computer otherwise it would look like this so now i 've been able to tidy up pictures that i 've wanted to tidy up for a long time here is a very good example take jackson pollock for example it 's -- oh no it 's -- that 's a really hard one but after a while i just decided here to go all the way and put the paint back into the cans or you could go into three-dimensional art here we have the fur cup by meret oppenheim here i just brought it back to its original state but yeah and it 's great you can even go you know -- or we have this pointillist movement for those of you who are into art the pointillist movement is that kind of paintings where everything is broken down into dots and pixels and then i -- this sort of thing is ideal for tidying up so i once applied myself to the work of the inventor of that method georges seurat and i collected together all his dots and now they 're all in here you can count them afterwards if you like you see that 's the wonderful thing about the tidy up art idea : it 's new so there is no existing tradition in it there is no textbooks i mean not yet anyway i mean it 's " the future we will create " but to round things up i would like to show you just one more this is the village square by pieter bruegel that 's how it looks like when you send everyone home yeah maybe you 're asking yourselves where old bruegel 's people went of course they 're not gone they 're all here i just piled them up so i 'm -- yeah actually i 'm kind of finished at that moment and for those who want to see more i 've got my book downstairs in the bookshop and i 'm happy to sign it for you with any name of any artist but before leaving i would like to show you i 'm working right now on another -- in a related field with my tidying up art method i 'm working in a related field and i started to bring some order into some flags here -- that 's just my new proposal here for the union jack and then maybe before i leave you â€¦ yeah i think after you have seen that i have to leave anyway yeah that was a hard one i could n't find a way to tidy that up properly so i just decided to make it a little bit more simpler thank you very much recently i visited beloit wisconsin and i was there to honor a great 20th century explorer roy chapman andrews during his time at the american museum of natural history andrews led a range of expeditions to uncharted regions like here in the gobi desert he was quite a figure he was later it 's said the basis of the indiana jones character and when i was in beloit wisconsin i gave a public lecture to a group of middle school students and i 'm here to tell you if there 's anything more intimidating than talking here at ted it 'll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture do n't try that one at the end of the lecture they asked a number of questions but there was one that 's really stuck with me since then there was a young girl who stood up and she asked the question : " where should we explore " i think there 's a sense that many of us have that the great age of exploration on earth is over that for the next generation they 're going to have to go to outer space or the deepest oceans in order to find something significant to explore but is that really the case is there really nowhere significant for us to explore left here on earth it sort of made me think back to one of my favorite explorers in the history of biology this is an explorer of the unseen world martinus beijerinck so beijerinck set out to discover the cause of tobacco mosaic disease what he did is he took the infected juice from tobacco plants and he would filter it through smaller and smaller filters and he reached the point where he felt that there must be something out there that was smaller than the smallest forms of life that were ever known -- bacteria at the time he came up with a name for his mystery agent he called it the virus -- latin for " poison " and in uncovering viruses beijerinck really opened this entirely new world for us we now know that viruses make up the majority of the genetic information on our planet more than the genetic information of all other forms of life combined and obviously there 's been tremendous practical applications associated with this world -- things like the eradication of smallpox the advent of a vaccine against cervical cancer which we now know is mostly caused by human papillomavirus and beijerinck 's discovery this was not something that occurred 500 years ago it was a little over 100 years ago that beijerinck discovered viruses so basically we had automobiles but we were unaware of the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet we now have these amazing tools to allow us to explore the unseen world -- things like deep sequencing which allow us to do much more than just skim the surface and look at individual genomes from a particular species but to look at entire metagenomes the communities of teeming microorganisms in on and around us and to document all of the genetic information in these species we can apply these techniques to things from soil to skin and everything in between in my organization we now do this on a regular basis to identify the causes of outbreaks that are unclear exactly what causes them and just to give you a sense of how this works imagine that we took a nasal swab from every single one of you and this is something we commonly do to look for respiratory viruses like influenza the first thing we would see is a tremendous amount of genetic information and if we started looking into that genetic information we 'd see a number of usual suspects out there -- of course a lot of human genetic information but also bacterial and viral information mostly from things that are completely harmless within your nose but we 'd also see something very very surprising as we started to look at this information we would see that about 20 percent of the genetic information in your nose does n't match anything that we 've ever seen before -- no plant animal fungus virus or bacteria basically we have no clue what this is and for the small group of us who actually study this kind of data a few of us have actually begun to call this information biological dark matter we know it 's not anything that we 've seen before ; it 's sort of the equivalent of an uncharted continent right within our own genetic information and there 's a lot of it if you think 20 percent of genetic information in your nose is a lot of biological dark matter if we looked at your gut up to 40 or 50 percent of that information is biological dark matter and even in the relatively sterile blood around one to two percent of this information is dark matter -- ca n't be classified ca n't be typed or matched with anything we 've seen before at first we thought that perhaps this was artifact these deep sequencing tools are relatively new but as they become more and more accurate we 've determined that this information is a form of life or at least some of it is a form of life and while the hypotheses for explaining the existence of biological dark matter are really only in their infancy there 's a very very exciting possibility that exists : that buried in this life in this genetic information are signatures of as of yet unidentified life that as we explore these strings of a 's t 's c 's and g 's we may uncover a completely new class of life that like beijerinck will fundamentally change the way that we think about the nature of biology that perhaps will allow us to identify the cause of a cancer that afflicts us or identify the source of an outbreak that we are n't familiar with or perhaps create a new tool in molecular biology i 'm pleased to announce that along with colleagues at stanford and caltech and ucsf we 're currently starting an initiative to explore biological dark matter for the existence of new forms of life a little over a hundred years ago people were unaware of viruses the forms of life that make up most of the genetic information on our planet a hundred years from now people may marvel that we were perhaps completely unaware of a new class of life that literally was right under our noses it 's true we may have charted all the continents on the planet and we may have discovered all the mammals that are out there but that does n't mean that there 's nothing left to explore on earth beijerinck and his kind provide an important lesson for the next generation of explorers -- people like that young girl from beloit wisconsin and i think if we phrase that lesson it 's something like this : do n't assume that what we currently think is out there is the full story go after the dark matter in whatever field you choose to explore there are unknowns all around us and they 're just waiting to be discovered thank you a few years ago i felt like i was stuck in a rut so i decided to follow in the footsteps of the great american philosopher morgan spurlock and try something new for 30 days the idea is actually pretty simple think about something you 've always wanted to add to your life and try it for the next 30 days it turns out 30 days is just about the right amount of time to add a new habit or subtract a habit -- like watching the news -- from your life there 's a few things i learned while doing these 30-day challenges the first was instead of the months flying by forgotten the time was much more memorable this was part of a challenge i did to take a picture every day for a month and i remember exactly where i was and what i was doing that day i also noticed that as i started to do more and harder 30-day challenges my self-confidence grew i went from desk-dwelling computer nerd to the kind of guy who bikes to work -- for fun even last year i ended up hiking up mt kilimanjaro the highest mountain in africa i would never have been that adventurous before i started my 30-day challenges i also figured out that if you really want something badly enough you can do anything for 30 days have you ever wanted to write a novel every november tens of thousands of people try to write their own 50,000-word novel from scratch in 30 days it turns out all you have to do is write 1,667 words a day for a month so i did by the way the secret is not to go to sleep until you 've written your words for the day you might be sleep-deprived but you 'll finish your novel now is my book the next great american novel no i wrote it in a month it 's awful but for the rest of my life if i meet john hodgman at a ted party i do n't have to say " i 'm a computer scientist " no no if i want to i can say " i 'm a novelist " so here 's one last thing i 'd like to mention i learned that when i made small sustainable changes things i could keep doing they were more likely to stick there 's nothing wrong with big crazy challenges in fact they 're a ton of fun but they 're less likely to stick when i gave up sugar for 30 days day 31 looked like this so here 's my question to you : what are you waiting for i guarantee you the next 30 days are going to pass whether you like it or not so why not think about something you have always wanted to try and give it a shot for the next 30 days thanks i thought i 'd begin with a scene of war there was little to warn of the danger ahead the iraqi insurgent had placed the ied an improvised explosive device along the side of the road with great care by 2006 there were more than 2,500 of these attacks every single month and they were the leading cause of casualties among american soldiers and iraqi civilians the team that was hunting for this ied is called an eod teamâ€” explosives ordinance disposalâ€”and they 're the pointy end of the spear in the american effort to suppress these roadside bombs each eod team goes out on about 600 of these bomb calls every year defusing about two bombs a day perhaps the best sign of how valuable they are to the war effort is that the iraqi insurgents put a $ 50,000 bounty on the head of a single eod soldier by the time the soldier advanced close enough to see the telltale wires of the bomb it exploded in a wave of flame now depending how close you are and how much explosive has been packed into that bomb it can cause death or injury you have to be as far as 50 yards away to escape that the blast is so strong it can even break your limbs even if you 're not hit that soldier had been on top of the bomb and so when the rest of the team advanced they found little left and that night the unit 's commander did a sad duty and he wrote a condolence letter back to the united states and he talked about how hard the loss had been on his unit about the fact that they had lost their bravest soldier a soldier who had saved their lives many a time and he apologized for not being able to bring them home but then he talked up the silver lining that he took away from the loss " at least " as he wrote " when a robot dies you do n't have to write a letter to its mother " that scene sounds like science fiction but is battlefield reality already the soldier in that case was a 42-pound robot called a packbot the chief 's letter went not to some farmhouse in iowa like you see in the old war movies but went to the irobot company which is named after the asimov novel and the not-so-great will smith movie and â€¦ um â€¦ â€¦ if you remember that in that fictional world robots started out carrying out mundane chores and then they started taking on life-and-death decisions that 's a reality we face today what we 're going to do is actually just flash a series of photos behind me that show you the reality of robots used in war right now or already at the prototype stage it 's just to give you a taste another way of putting it is you 're not going to see anything that 's powered by vulcan technology or teenage wizard hormones or anything like that this is all real so why do n't we go ahead and start those pictures something big is going on in war today and maybe even the history of humanity itself the u.s. military went into iraq with a handful of drones in the air we now have 5,300 we went in with zero unmanned ground systems we now have 12,000 and the tech term " killer application " takes on new meaning in this space and we need to remember that we 're talking about the model t fords the wright flyers compared to what 's coming soon that 's where we 're at right now one of the people that i recently met with was an air force three-star general and he said basically where we 're headed very soon is tens of thousands of robots operating in our conflicts and these numbers matter because we 're not just talking about tens of thousands of today 's robots but tens of thousands of these prototypes and tomorrow 's robots because of course one of the things that 's operating in technology is moore 's law that you can pack in more and more computing power into those robots and so flash forward around 25 years if moore 's law holds true those robots will be close to a billion times more powerful in their computing than today and so what that means is the kind of things that we used to only talk about at science fiction conventions like comic-con have to be talked about in the halls of power and places like the pentagon a robots revolution is upon us now i need to be clear here i 'm not talking about a revolution where you have to worry about the governor of california showing up at your door a la the terminator when historians look at this period they 're going to conclude that we 're in a different type of revolution : a revolution in war like the invention of the atomic bomb but it may be even bigger than that because our unmanned systems do n't just affect the " how " of war-fighting they affect the " who " of fighting at its most fundamental level that is every previous revolution in war be it the machine gun be it the atomic bomb was about a system that either shot faster went further had a bigger boom that 's certainly the case with robotics but they also change the experience of the warrior and even the very identity of the warrior another way of putting this is that mankind 's 5,000-year-old monopoly on the fighting of war is breaking down in our very lifetime i 've spent the last several years going around meeting with all the players in this field from the robot scientists to the science fiction authors who inspired them to the 19-year-old drone pilots who are fighting from nevada to the four-star generals who command them to even the iraqi insurgents who they are targeting and what they think about our systems and what i found interesting is not just their stories but how their experiences point to these ripple effects that are going outwards in our society in our law and our ethics etc and so what i 'd like to do with my remaining time is basically flesh out a couple of these so the first is that the future of war even a robotics one is not going to be purely an american one the u.s. is currently ahead in military robotics right now but we know that in technology there 's no such thing as a permanent first move or advantage in a quick show of hands how many people in this room still use wang computers it 's the same thing in war the british and the french invented the tank the germans figured out how to use it right and so what we have to think about for the u.s. is that we are ahead right now but you have 43 other countries out there working on military robotics and they include all the interesting countries like russia china pakistan iran and this raises a bigger worry for me how do we move forward in this revolution given the state of our manufacturing and the state of our science and mathematics training in our schools or another way of thinking about this is what does it mean to go to war increasingly with soldiers whose hardware is made in china and software is written in india but just as software has gone open-source so has warfare unlike an aircraft carrier or an atomic bomb you do n't need a massive manufacturing system to build robotics a lot of it is off the shelf a lot of it 's even do-it-yourself one of those things you just saw flashed before you was a raven drone the handheld tossed one for about a thousand dollars you can build one yourself equivalent to what the soldiers use in iraq that raises another wrinkle when it comes to war and conflict good guys might play around and work on these as hobby kits but so might bad guys this cross between robotics and things like terrorism is going to be fascinating and we 've already seen it start during the war between israel a state and hezbollah a non-state actor the non-state actor flew four different drones against israel there 's already a jihadi website that you can go on and remotely detonate an ied in iraq while sitting at your home computer and so i think what we 're going to see is two trends take place with this first is you 're going to reinforce the power of individuals against governments but then the second is that we are going to see an expansion in the realm of terrorism the future of it may be a cross between al qaeda 2.0 and the next generation of the unabomber and another way of thinking about this is the fact that remember you do n't have to convince a robot that they 're gon na receive 72 virgins after they die to convince them to blow themselves up but the ripple effects of this are going to go out into our politics one of the people that i met with was a former assistant secretary of defense for ronald reagan and he put it this way : " i like these systems because they save american lives but i worry about more marketization of wars more shock-and-awe talk to defray discussion of the costs people are more likely to support the use of force if they view it as costless " robots for me take certain trends that are already in play in our body politic and maybe take them to their logical ending point we do n't have a draft we do n't have declarations of war anymore we do n't buy war bonds anymore and now we have the fact that we 're converting more and more of our american soldiers that we would send into harm 's way into machines and so we may take those already lowering bars to war and drop them to the ground but the future of war is also going to be that is our new technologies do n't merely remove humans from risk they also record everything that they see so they do n't just delink the public : they reshape its relationship with war there 's already several thousand video clips of combat footage from iraq on youtube right now most of it gathered by drones now this could be a good thing it could be building connections between the home front and the war front but remember this is taking place in our strange weird world and so inevitably the ability to download these video clips to you know your ipod or your zune gives you the ability to turn it into entertainment soldiers have a name for these clips they call it war porn the typical one that i was sent was an email that had an attachment of video of a predator strike taking out an enemy site missile hits bodies burst into the air with the explosion it was set to music it was set to the pop song " i just want to fly " by sugar ray this ability to watch more but experience less creates a wrinkle in the public 's relationship with war i think about this with a sports parallel it 's like the difference between watching an nba game a professional basketball game on tv where the athletes are tiny figures on the screen and being at that basketball game in person and realizing what someone seven feet really does look like but we have to remember these are just the clips these are just the espn sportscenter version of the game they lose the context they lose the humanity war just becomes slam dunks and smart bombs now the irony of all this is that while the future of war may involve more and more machines it 's our human psychology that 's driving all of this it 's our human failings that are leading to these wars so one example of this that has big resonance in the policy realm is how this plays out on our very real war of ideas that we 're fighting what is the message that we think we are sending with these machines versus what is being received in terms of the message so one of the people that i met was a senior bush administration official who had this to say about our unmanning of war " it plays to our strength the thing that scares people is our technology " but when you go out and meet with people for example in lebanon it 's a very different story one of the people i met with there was a news editor and we 're talking as a drone is flying above him and this is what he had to say </s>
