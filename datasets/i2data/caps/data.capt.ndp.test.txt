Very much to the contrary— —and what you said just earlier , that he is engaged in the revision of history . He’s not , he’s a neo-Nazi propagandist , and this is what Justice Gray said in the verdict in his battle with Deborah Lipstadt . He is a neo-Nazi political activist , and he is using distorted history to propagandize for his cause . </s>
And nobody had much heard of him until you put him on trial . </s>
Well , you can fill it , you’re a journalist , you’re supposed to know these facts . He’s a best-selling author . He’s very important guy , he gets into people’s living room . Not for a while though , because he’s in a prison cell . Nazis always get in the living room , but— </s>
His book , his edition of The Goebbels Diary is a very useful and interesting book that everyone who wants to know more about the period should read . Let’s get some more— For example , it’s only in that book that it’s proved that the British Union of Fascists took money from the Nazi party , a claim they’d always denied . The question is , do you think you’re big enough to read a book by David Irving and make up your own mind about it , or do you think that someone else should do that for me . Right ? </s>
Yes , next question . A very simple question . Alan Miller , New York Salon . I do take issue particularly with David Cesarani’s view , when he talks about how vulnerable everyone is . </s>
It’s almost like an egalitarian-speak , this notion that humans are not robust and can not discuss ideas and make decisions and be autonomous . </s>
So my question to the panel tonight is , when it comes to the really tricky , sticky issues , like we see around children and pedophilia , or as we see on the campuses , where we see speech etiquette , or when we see in the workplaces speeches of code , would they agree with the prospect that you should have the right to be offensive , and free speech at all times . That’s my question to them . </s>
Mari , can you address that ? The line that I draw is between the right to dissent , to express your opinion , if you’re Gallileo , to oppose the powers that be and say that the sun is the center of the universe , that’s free speech . That’s what we need for democracy to thrive . </s>
The speech that I think is of lower value and that I’m asking us to consider restricting is speech that assaults , wounds , degrades and excludes . Let me give you a specific example since you raised the workplace . </s>
It’s a frequent pattern that the first woman to show up in a traditionally male job , in the coalmine , on the oil rig , is relentlessly harassed—with words . Men describing her body , and saying they would like to rape her , and describing what that would be like . She goes to work every day and tries to do her job , up on a construction site . I think that goes beyond offense . </s>
I think that is an effort to exclude . People use these words because they’re tied to a history of violence , because they do terrorize people , and that is their intent . Now the other side is trying to say that we’re for opening the door of censorship . I certainly don’t stand for that . </s>
I think that this audience voted in the vast majority for the proposition precisely because they distrust censorship , and that’s good , that’s important . Any effort to limit speech has to be done carefully , through the rule of law , with discernment . </s>
But we can do it . We’ve done that with defamation . We allow people to insult each other , but we don’t allow them to destroy character and reputation in ways that the law calls actual malice . It’s very close to requiring intent . </s>
That’s a limit , that means that a lot of very nasty speech is still allowed . </s>
But we’re trying to create that breaching space so that women can go to work , so that that family that’s the wrong race can move into that neighborhood , where we can have conversations like this one that are very hard . If it degenerates into name-calling the conversation shuts down , and what I’m trying to do is prevent the conversation-ending move in a world in which we need to talk . That’s Mari Matsuda , Signe Wilkinson ? </s>
One little example of how this works in the real world was in the mid-‘90s at the University of Pennsylvania . There were some kids making noise outside of a dorm room . </s>
Some guy leaned out the window and told the water buffaloes to shut up . The water buffaloes took it to the speech code people at the university . Had they not , the guy who had said “water buffaloes” would’ve been the jerk that he was , but as it turned out , then the girls who got all upset about it made a federal case out of it . </s>
They ended up looking stupid , as did the administration of the University of Pennsylvania . Water buffaloes , I mean where are you going to draw the line ? It’s an animal , it’s not like saying— </s>
A very nice animal— —I’m going to kill you . So to me it’s like…if you let someone say something stupid , they’re the ones who look idiotic . </s>
If then you start—like David Irving , I might add—but when you start taking him on and like Christopher said giving him the platform , then it’s you who are starting to look like you can’t quite join the debate . Let’s take another question . Can you hand that woman the microphone ? I’m sorry . We’ll get to you next . </s>
Okay , my question is the following . There was a cartoon in the New York Times a couple of weeks ago which was never talked about , and it was from Ohio . They always do a synopsis of cartoons that they think are particularly relevant— </s>
Yes , we know . So it was the Pope saying , “I’m sorry that my remarks about Islamic violence provoked Islamic violence.” Now , nobody made a big scene about that , but who made the big scene about the Danish cartoon , who fired up the world about the Danish cartoon . Who got it started was an Islamic cleric , who got everybody in an uproar— </s>
So what’s your question ? So my question is , why does this happen only in this situation when it was outside of the United States , and why did it not happen here . Okay . </s>
Daisy , do you have a response ? I think that was mostly addressed to you . Yes . </s>
Well , I think what happened with the Danish cartoon was that when the cartoon was published there was a small demonstration by certain Muslim groups . </s>
The newspaper decided they were not going to pay any attention to that because they had a license to free speech and expression which was fine . Then they took it up to some of the ambassadors of Muslim countries and they were hoping that their intervention might have helped with the situation . The ambassadors called for a meeting with the prime minister , and that meeting was refused . As you know , the ambassadors were ambassadors from various Muslim countries , and they wanted to have a meeting with him . He basically said I have nothing to do with this because this is not within my realm . </s>
They called for a lawsuit , and that lawsuit was not pursued . </s>
Basically the community felt their hurts and their concerns were not being addressed . They went overseas and sought support from overseas and then the whole situation went out of control— </s>
They started a pogrom . So wait , wait , no— Christopher’s turn to—let Christopher respond— </s>
No , I just want to finish the point . </s>
What I’m saying is that had it been addressed at the local level it would have never become the international phenomenon that it became . It should be addressed at the local level , like Signe did . When the Philadelphia Inquirer decided to publish that same carton , they called the Muslim community and said we want to do something about this and we want to create dialogue . </s>
Now that was responsible , that was socially responsible . Christopher , go ahead . When Dr. Samuel Johnson had finished his great lexicography , the first real English dictionary , he was visited by various delegations of people to congratulate him , including a delegation of London’s respectable womanhood who came to his parlor in Fleet Street and said Doctor , we congratulate you on your decision to exclude all indecent words from your dictionary . He said , “Ladies , I congratulate you on your persistence in looking them up.” I think anyone who understands that story , which I’m pleased to see everybody obviously does , will see through the sinister piffle we were treated to just now . </s>
If people are determined to be offended , if they will climb up on the ladder , balancing it precariously on their own toilet system , to be upset by what they see through the neighbor’s bathroom window , there’s nothing you can do about that . The Imams in Denmark did the following . First , they invited the intervention of 22 foreign ambassadors in Denmark’s internal affairs , itself a disgrace , and the Danish prime minister quite rightly repudiated it . Then they added two cartoons of their own , drawn by them , one of them showing the prophet Mohammed in the shape of a pig , then they shopped those round the Muslim world until they could get kindling going under the embassies of a small democracy in the capitol cities of countries where demonstrations are normally not allowed . They violated Danish diplomatic immunity , they tried to sabotage the Danish economy , there were random pogroms and attacks on individual Scandinavians . </s>
And , David Cesarani says he doesn’t like the reminiscence of the 1930s that is inscribed in the cartoon . I don’t like the reminiscence of the 1930s that is involved in a Kristallnacht against Denmark , put up by religious demagogues and thugs , and that’s what needs to be put down . </s>
David Cesarani . I actually agree with much of what Christopher has just said . I think the response in the Muslim communities and in Muslim countries , and in countries of large Muslim populations was abysmal . </s>
But I will absolutely defend the right of Muslims to protest in peaceful ways against those cartoons and to lobby . So would I . So would all of us . Gooooood , okay , there’s a measure of agreement . We all agree— </s>
Now , let’s see if we can push it a bit further— Wow , you— Wait , wait , wait , let him finish— </s>
Just stop interrupting— </s>
—we had a beautiful moment of agreement . So let’s , let’s , let’s let David go ahead . You’re an angry man . Let’s think about this town . New York , New York . </s>
The gentleman there asked the question about who are these marginal , vulnerable groups . It’s kind of interesting that a lot of people , certainly on that side , have decided , well , Muslim , they’re not vulnerable or marginal , they don’t need protection . </s>
If you exclude them , who’s left . Gay men…women , probably not , Jews , definitely not . But how do we get to that position where gays or Jews in this town , are so strong , so powerful , so invulnerable . So much so that when Jesse Jackson had the temerity and the misfortune to refer to this great city as Hymietown , it was the end of his political career . I don’t know how Christopher Hitchens or Philip or Signe want to talk about gay men and women , but I guess there are quite a few epithets and words they would not use— </s>
I have no idea— </s>
—to describe their lifestyle or sexual preferences . Then there’s the N word . </s>
The N word . Do you want it back ? Christopher ? </s>
Do you want it on prime-time TV , front page of newspapers ? I don’t want you jailing people for using it— Do you want it back , do you want cartoons of lynchings ? </s>
Well , allow me to answer— Is that what you want ? What kind of foolishness is this— Is it all right to inflict that on Muslims but not on gay men , not on Jews— </s>
Don’t be silly— You’re being completely preposterous . All right , no , wait—you’re getting yourself all— you’re getting your knickers all in a twist here— Okay , Philip , go ahead , answer—he asked a question , answer his question— Allow me to say that you’re just creating a lot of fantasies for yourself that are quite ridiculous . </s>
It’s not a— No , wait , let , let Philip—Christopher , let Philip— </s>
I take it as— First of all— I take it— Go ahead . It’s my turn— </s>
I am going to take it as a tribute to the superior cogency of our side that there’s this repeated change of subject from the other side . For example . No , it’s not the— </s>
Nobody says it would be a good thing if the word “nigger” appeared all the time in the press . What we say is that those who want to be offended don’t have the right to close down the newspapers that offend them . Nor by the way is the reason that word “nigger” doesn’t appear in the press because you would jail people who put it there . </s>
I appeal to anyone in this audience— The advertisers wouldn’t show or— One at a time— </s>
I appeal to any— Ah , the power of capital ! </s>
That’s a good defense . I appeal to any male— It is . I appeal to any male in this audience— </s>
Quite proud of it . —who might see a woman being insulted at work or perhaps on the subway or on a bus or on the street or in a bar or in a restaurant , by an obscene , loudmouthed man . </s>
There isn’t a man in this room I’m sure whose sword wouldn’t flash in his scabbard , to defend the rights of womanhood in such a case . If that wasn’t the case , there’s going to be no law that will protect women from men with Tourette’s syndrome , I’m awfully sorry to say . May I have my turn ? It’s just an attempt to change— Let’s get another question here— </s>
I actually want to respond though to what was said— </s>
No , you can’t respond to him , he’s on your side ! No , you asked me— You asked me to respond to David Cesarani . No , hold it , let’s let the audience— You wanted me to respond to David Cesarani— </s>
—get involved here— —who specifically was saying that he agreed with us on a point which he previously disagreed with us on which is the idea that he thought it was appropriate that there should be peaceful protests . However , he objected— </s>
Philip , really— —to the idea that any Jewish leaders in America should peacefully protest what was being said by Tony Judd by saying that they should not be allowed to put pressure on an organization— </s>
Next— —where he spoke . Stop . That’s absurd . Philip— Paul , go ahead , wait , Paul has a question , hold on , hold on— </s>
I’d love to ask a question quickly , my name is Paul Holdengraber , I’m the Director of Public Programs at the New York Public Library . I feel for this side which is opposed because they’ve been so terribly weak and I would be surprised that after this debate there are more than two or three people on your side . But be that as it may , I would like— What makes you think that ? </s>
Well , I would like to— No campaign speeches , ask a question , Paul . —simply ask this question of David Cesarani . </s>
I don’t understand why on earth you brought up the example of Tony Judd . You mentioned it , you didn’t explain it , you said nothing about it . Could you say something cogent about that at least . Okay . David Cesarani . </s>
I’ll try and be cogent . It comes back to the question that Christopher Hitchens quite correctly raised . Who decides on these speech issues , on hate speech . Now , I think that American campuses are actually exemplary in this respect , and I think the American government has found a way of demarcating what it is permissible to say and what is offensive and dangerous , without going to law . I think that sets a precedent of how you can decide . </s>
I don’t think it is terribly good when powerful individuals phone up institutions , and by the tone of their voice have meetings canceled . </s>
I think there may be very good grounds for objecting and protesting , I think it is permissible to lobby . But I think that kind of intervention is not a good idea . I certainly don’t think that we should leave the defense of the weak and the marginal up to the advertisers , which seems to be what Philip believes is the way to defend our interests . Philip Gourevitch ? All I said , that he’s trying to refer to in that bizarre quip , is that the reason that you don’t have the word “nigger” or that you don’t have a lot of the derogatory images that he was sort of proposing in a heated moment that—would you like to see these things returned to the public airwaves , ohhhh , was that they’re not on the public airwaves not because we’ve actually outlawed them and thrown everybody in jail in Austria as you advocate , but actually because— </s>
No , I said— —they’re not on the public airwaves . </s>
Because one would not get an audience for them because people would protest those stations because people would make firm phone calls exercising their freedom of speech to say , you know what ? We don’t want anything to do with you . </s>
You have no basis , I bet , you’ve never made a phone call , you’ve never asked a question , and you’ve done no reporting to find out whether Abe Foxman made that call , which has never been proven . </s>
I sit on the board of Penn and we raised the Tony Judd question . Absolutely nobody could ascertain whether or not Abe Foxman made that call . He may have made it , or he may not . Somebody made the call . </s>
But you’re— But he does have Tourette’s syndrome— —very , very , very confident— You’re very , very confident in accusing of somebody in public of something that you know nothing about— Let’s have another question— </s>
—which is gross ignorance , but no , I would like to finish something for a minute , Jeffrey . I’m not done . A gentleman with a British accent asked a question earlier of David Cesarani which he ducked very carefully . </s>
He raised the question , why is it that you’re so nervous about the broad public in his criticism of Enlightenment thinking and of Mill and of this one and that one . He sort of yearns for a clubby time , when you could count on a few select elites having a kind of common agreement . </s>
And that now what’s dangerous to him is the proliferation of voices , the idea that there are many ideas out there on the Internet , oh my goodness , and we can’t regulate them , and they might get in the hands of the wrong people and we can’t even agree who they are . For goodness sakes , those clubby people , as they put it , you know , even the Jews can have an opinion . I mean , why are you so concerned that there might actually be some unregulated voices out there ? You know what , let’s just go to a question . I think that it’s sometimes a lot harder to defend very hateful , personal speech , like when hate groups leaflet the lawn of a neighborhood where a black family has just moved into a white neighborhood . </s>
We’re running low on time , so get to a question , please . But Daisy , do you really think that it’s a problem that we had cartoons that were… unfortunately distasteful to Muslim people , but cartoons in a newspaper that were quite humorous really , and I think they were talking about quite a legitimate political issue . Do you really want to ban that kind of free speech ? </s>
You don’t want to allow editorial cartoons ? </s>
That’s a fair question , but we’ve sort of done this question , we’ve done the Danish cartoons— We’ve done this question , yes , yes , it’s a waste of a question— I think that’s a good point . Up there at the top . I would just like to know , and I’ll be the first to admit that I was not aware of this whole discussion about the cancellation of this meeting . </s>
But when Mr. Foxman , or if anyone who called and got it canceled did so , were death threats part of the reason— Of course not— No , they were not , you know , let’s— </s>
Okay , thank you— I mean , let’s put Abe Foxman and Gallileo aside and— </s>
I do have a jot point that I would like to make . Oh— I’ll make it quickly . </s>
Okay , quickly , Christopher . After my punch-up with George Galloway recently I was asked by the Republican Jewish Committee in Washington to come and speak to their ‘do down at the Old Temple and talk about the oil- for-food program and other things like that . They put my name on the bill , and then a gentleman named Mort Klein who some of you will know… He’s a madman who runs the Zionist Organization of America . He kicked up a terrific fuss because of some remarks I’d once made about Theodore Herzl , among other things , and got the meeting canceled . </s>
Now , I don’t particularly complain about that as a matter of fact , and I don’t share in the tremendous steambath of self-pity that Mr. Judd has managed to generate . </s>
You have a right to your opinion . </s>
You don’t have necessarily have a right to the audience of the Republican Jewish Committee . They can decide not to have you . </s>
That’s okay . I’m just trying to say , just for once if we could stop people intruding things that don’t belong in this discussion , it’d save such a lot of time . </s>
Two more questions , this gentleman right here . Where do you draw the line between free speech and political correctness . Another— You know , that’s sort of— </s>
Waste of a question— We’ve been dealing with that issue generally , why don’t we get to this gentleman over here . MAN Back here ? No , this gentleman in the white shirt , get a microphone . Stupid , boring questions should be disallowed . </s>
No , but we need the microphone for radio purposes though . You can’t speak loud enough so that all of WNYC can hear you . </s>
Thank you , just a quick question . One of the things I noticed on the panel is that no one talked about the civil rights movement and how that’s affected the topic here . Also , just quite frankly , how come there’s no African-American people on the panel ? I’d just like to get your thoughts on that . Next . </s>
Well , I mean I think that’s a point that everyone can take for what it’s worth . At the end ? That was useful for the radio audience— At the top , at the very top , underneath the light . </s>
That’s you , go ahead . Okay , this is a question for Mari . You talked about women in the workforce . I don’t work on an oil rig , but I do work on a trading floor . I’m just wondering if you think that by limiting what people can say to me , if that’s actually protecting me from what people are thinking about me , and whether when I come into the office , I need to take care of myself . </s>
Good . Mari ? I trust that you can . But there are circumstances in which women have left jobs because they could not handle the relentless and brutal assaults on their personhood . This is why in civil rights law , to— </s>
Not free expression . —respond to the earlier question— Not a free expression— Wait , wait . The reason in civil rights and anti-discrimination law we do limit speech in the workplace , is that ideas about your inferiority , about your inherent lack of worth as a human being and your lack of entitlement to equality in the workplace , if they’re expressed regularly to you , create an environment in which it’s impossible for you to do your job on an equal basis with everyone else . </s>
Does someone on this side want to address the point Mari’s made , which is that there is kind of speech , harassment . Is that speech you seek to protect ? </s>
I get that kind of speech all the time . One of my favorites was being called a liberal cocksucker . Now , I don’t know whether that means I like to cock-suck liberally or I only suck liberal cock or I just am not quite sure . </s>
But I didn’t call the police on it . Furthermore , half the people who write me horrible , horrible things , no one has seen my mail , they all start it , “Dear Mr. Wilkinson.” So it’s not me as a woman , it’s the ideas I put in the paper , and if we can’t discuss those ideas , even when they talk to me in loathsome , funny ways , we can’t talk . The one thing I would like to say about the whole Danish cartoonist thing is this . </s>
Having had that confrontation has changed minds on both sides . The BBC reported that about two weeks ago there was another minor dust-up about it . But the reason you didn’t hear about it is because the Muslim side realized that it really wasn’t great PR to kill people in Pakistan to protest cartoons in Denmark . So it’s a much different protest , it’s been handled differently on both sides , including the Danish side . This is how we learn . </s>
We learn by conflict , we learn by calling each other things that , ehh , well , maybe weren’t a great idea at the time , but we can do it differently next time . Forgive me for interrupting , but it’s now time to vote . </s>
If you want to vote for the motion— everybody’s got their cards—you want to tear off the greenish-blue , kind of aqua side . If you want to vote against , you tear off the red side . </s>
If you don’t know where you stand , you just put the entire ticket in the box . Now , can I ask everyone to please vote quietly . The boxes will be passed around . How long does this take . </s>
No , it’s going to go on while you—you’re going to talk while they’re doing it . You can start right away . All right . Wait . </s>
Who stars ? While you’re voting we’re going to go to final statements . The order is , please begin against the proposition , Mari Matsuda . You can stay where you are . </s>
We docked some of her time , remember . We docked some of her time . </s>
Yes , we did dock some of her time . The “N” word is hollered out from a passing car to let a black man know that he is not walking in a neighborhood where he is welcome or safe . The speaker knows the effect of that word , and uses it precisely because it terrorizes . I asked earlier : why is it that we recognize in American law that if someone spits on your shoe , that’s an attack on your person , but we won’t recognize words that we know , socially , historically , from the reality of the human lives that we live , have exactly the same effect on your personhood and your ability to move freely ? </s>
I am talking about liberty and it’s fascinating that we are all coming from the Enlightenment tradition . As much as we disagree , I feel affinity with people on the opposing side because we are all concerned with losing our democracy and losing our freedom . </s>
I think there are forms of speech that make us less free because we stop talking to each other and we don’t have the conversations we need to survive . Allowing this kind of invective perpetuated… Daisy has been out on a limb by herself defending the Muslim community and I have to speak up . There is hatred of Islam in this country and it’s not a healthy thing . There’s also ignorance . </s>
We need to open a space where we can talk to each other , disagree , criticize , and learn , and that space closes when people are allowed to assault . I’m not asking for censorship , I’m asking that if you support the proposition , you’re making a choice for a license to assault . </s>
Daisy , that— If you oppose it— </s>
That’s it— </s>
—you open the door for a conversation about limits . Okay , next . Thank you . </s>
that was Mari Matsuda . </s>
Now for the proposition , Signe Wilkinson . </s>
Well , I basically said earlier pretty much what I think here . </s>
I’ll just go back to what Christopher said . This is a conversation . If you forbid someone to say what’s truly on their mind , you won’t know what is on their mind . </s>
It’s better almost every time , it seems to me , to find out what it is , and then be able to deal with it . I think that some of the questions get back to what is truly hateful speech and our history is filled with , for example , horrible images of black Americans who were made fun of simply because they were black , and these images occurred everywhere , in Courier and Ives and all of the major publications in the United States . But the way that changed was not by someone saying , you may not ever , ever do a bad caricature of a black person . It was changed because the civil rights movement and black Americans showed through their own incredible endurance and persistence in going for equal rights in this country , that that movement made those images look awful . </s>
You can’t look at them today without wincing . It says more about the people who drew the cartoons than about who they were drawn by . I feel sorry for you in New York because you don’t have very many really bitter cartoons published here , the New York Times protects you from that . But I really urge you to go on the Web , find out what people are thinking , and you’ll find out through cartoons among other pieces of free speech . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Signe Wilkinson . Against , David Cesarani . I think what Signe said then about the struggle of black Americans to eradicate racist images from public media was very interesting and very important . </s>
It was about equal rights . There was a loss . There were some cartoonists who made a living from , you know , making fun of black people and depicting them in ghastly ways who probably went out of business , or just migrated to certain parts of America where that sort of thing is still tolerated . Elsewhere , however , the dignity and equality of black Americans—as is true of women , gays , and other groups who used to suffer demeaning and degrading images and speech acts—and the need to create and preserve a civilized , civil society , in which civility and respect of one for another is absolutely vital , triumphed . Dignity , equality and civility are values . </s>
They are goods . Our freedom of expression is a value , and it is a good . On this side we’ve simply been asking you to weigh up those values , those goods . </s>
We think that human dignity , equal treatment , and having a truly civil society is worth a modest , preferable voluntary degree of constraint , restraint , a kind of humility . </s>
Knowing where to draw the line . Thank you . Thank you . David Cesarani . </s>
Now , for the proposition , Philip Gourevitch . The proposition is , freedom of expression must include the license to offend . </s>
I would return to the idea that this is fundamentally the lesser of various not-ideal prospects . The other prospect is that one licenses someone to determine what offends , and that one is always at the prey of that question . Who is to judge , who is to decide , how are we to restrict their ability to license our ability to offend . In other words how are we to restrict their ability to restrict us . At what point does this admittedly slippery slope immediately become this greased precipice , and we fall off into a very dangerous situation . </s>
The other side says , speech is dangerous , speech can be hateful , there’s hatred and ignorance out there , and therefore they want , in some way , to muzzle the people they fear are dangerous . I agree with them that speech can be dangerous and that there is a great deal of hatred and ignorance out there . We’ve heard a good deal of ignorance even tonight . </s>
I feel that that is why I urge you strongly to listen to the dangerous speech you’re hearing from the other side , and recognize exactly how it can impinge upon your ability not only to speak but to think . The fact that they keep using this strangely castrated phrase , “the ‘N’ word.” Which is supposed to be inoffensive , but is actually doubly offensive because it restricts you from the ability to hear the full offense of the word “nigger.” They’re at every time trying to double back and triple around and make you use words and trip over your own mind and not think and not speak what actually might occur to you in your effort to observe reality and contend with it . I think that’s a very dangerous predicament , I think that they’re presumptuous and wild in their notion that we can do that reasonably , and I think that we are at less risk taking the great risk of freedom . </s>
Thank you , Philip Gourevitch . Against the proposition , Daisy Khan . If all of us here wanted to offend each other , I’m sure we can . </s>
But would it be beneficial to building trust , and building long-term relationships ? I was stunned at the response I got about my rabbi friend . It is because I had been dialoguing with the Jewish community— </s>
What Jewish friend . </s>
Stop . </s>
Enough . What rabbi friend . Yes , your question has been registered . Daisy , please continue . It is the deep dialogue that has been going on between me and the Jewish community that has resulted in that concern for our community . </s>
It is out of that concern that the rabbi friend reached out to me and said , do not let this happen to you . So I was a little shell-shocked at the reaction we got from people here . </s>
As I mentioned , we’re living in a tense global environment , where misunderstanding is increased by peddlers of fear , and overpowered by intolerance . Today what is needed is civility , tolerance , patience , and sincerity . We need to get rid of negative words like “offend”—it’s a neighbor word—and replace them with positive words like “befriend.” </s>
Only once you make the effort to understand the perspective of the other person can you begin to understand the rationale behind their actions and thoughts . Furthermore , you’ll be in a better position to influence them , and only then can you even begin to be critical . We humans have a nasty habit of judging the book by its cover . </s>
If you’re offensive , it is difficult to make a difference because you’re seen as hostile , and your views are unwelcomed and outright rejected . This is human nature . No doubt it is essential to be critical . But do so at the right time , in the right environment , and with the right choice of words . </s>
Sticks and stones are not the only things that break bones , ladies and gentlemen , words do too . </s>
On a personal note , the reason I’m here today and I’ve dedicated the rest of my life to furthering understanding between peoples has to do with my powerful memories of my childhood in Kashmir . I went to Catholic school , was taught by Irish nuns , learned math from Hindu professors , played with Sikhs and Buddhists and was told the tale of how Kashmiris were from the lost 10th tribe of Israel . I was exposed to this broad perspective of unity and diversity , where celebrating and honoring each other’s traditions and beliefs was a way of life , but alas , this heaven turned into hell too . Thank you , Daisy Khan , against the proposition . </s>
Finally , for the proposition , Christopher Hitchens . The real question , or if you like , subtext question before us is this—is nothing sacred . What we’ve really been discussing is the old question of whether or not there is such an offense as blasphemy or profanity . </s>
Now if I don’t tell you exactly what I think about the simpering speeches that we heard from the other side , I’m not censoring myself , I’m just being polite and civil and saving some of your time . What I will not prevent myself from saying , and will not let anyone else prevent me from saying , is the following . </s>
It is wrong and always has been for churches , powerful , secular , human institutions , to claim exemption from criticism , which is what’s really being asked here . </s>
If there’s going to be respect , it has to be mutual . </s>
Does Islam respect my right to un-belief ? </s>
Of course it does not . Does it respect the right of a Muslim to apostasize and change belief ? Of course it does not . I can name now four or five friends—six or eight , maybe , if I had time—five or six you would certainly have heard of—who have to live their lives under police protection for commenting on Islam . </s>
For having an opinion on it . This is getting steadily worse all the time , and it’s grotesque . Here is an enormous religion with gigantic power that claims that an archangel spoke to an illiterate peasant , and brought him a final revelation that supercedes all others . It’s a plagiarism by an epileptic of the worst bits of Judaism and Christianity . </s>
That’s obvious , it seems to me . How long do you think I’m going to be able to say that anywhere I like ? It would already be quite a risky thing to say in quite a lot of places . I did not come to the United States of America 25 years to learn how to keep my mouth shut . </s>
I’m going to reject all offers that I change that policy , however simperingly they are put , okay ? Please join me in thanking the debaters for a terrific work . Now it’s time for me to announce the results . </s>
As you recall , just to refresh your memory , before the debate was 177 for the proposition , 25 against , and 24 don’t know . Now , the result is 201 for the proposition , 39 against , 1 doesn’t know . So please congratulate the “for” team for winning the debate . I’d like to invite everyone to return next month for the third Intelligence Squared debate , Wednesday , November 29th here at the Asia Society . The motion to be debated there has nothing to do with Abe Foxman or Gallileo . </s>
The subject is “A democratically elected Hamas is still a terrorist organization , ” and it will be moderated by Judy Woodruff . </s>
An edited version of tonight’s Intelligence Squared debate can be heard locally on WNYC-AM 820 , on Friday , October 27th , at 2 p.m . Check your other NPR listings for other broadcasts outside of New York City . Please be sure to pick up a copy of media sponsor Thursday edition the Times of London and a Times Literary Supplement on your way out . Thank you all for coming . And I 'd also like to introduce the man who , 50 debates ago , founded Intelligence Squared U.S. , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Welcome . This evening is special because it marks our collaboration with the Film Society of Lincoln Center , coordinated with the opening of their splendid new facility and their premier of a documentary about The New York Times , “Page One , ” which has a nice feature about Intelligence Squared , actually . It 's also very special for Intelligence Squared , for our mission to promote a higher level of public discourse in America and for all of our supporters and staff , for John Donvan , for our research head , Kris Kamikawa , for our executive producer , Dana Wolfe , and for me , because tonight we reach a landmark , which is our 50th debate . </s>
The First Amendment reads , quote , `` Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of the press . '' But Congress did pass a law back in 1917 called the Espionage Act which applies broadly to national defense information . The law prohibits disclosing such information to persons not authorized to receive it , who have reasons to know it could prejudice national security or U.S. interests . The founders recognized that a free press is an essential antidote to an abusive government . </s>
But Congress recognized that a measure of secrecy is an essential attribute of an effective government . No reasonable person would dispute that matters like the movement of troops , the names of spies or the plans for building a nuclear bomb are necessary secrets which the press should not be publishing . But no sophisticated person would doubt that governments can be tempted to use the guise of national security to protect the reputation and electability of its officials . And between these two extremes , there are abundant shades of gray in which the national security bureaucracy might be genuine in its concerns but overbroad in its actions . </s>
I saw this myself when , early in my career , I was a national security analyst at the RAND Corporation . All of us had security clearances . But some of our work was classified at such a high level that their authors could not read them . The tensions here are obvious . The press will want to err on the side of disclosure , the government on the side of secrecy . </s>
Well , how are the inevitable conflicts to be resolved ? What principles should be applied and by whom ? Should the press publish what they like and take the risk of prosecution afterwards ? </s>
Or should government be able to prevent publication in the first instance ? And who exactly is the press ? A tricky question in an era of bloggers and WikiLeaks . </s>
These are complex and important issues . We have an extraordinary panel with us this evening to help you decide . And it 's my pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator , John Donvan . </s>
Thank you . John , thank you . And may I just invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible . So a major newspaper -- say a major newspaper of record gets a hold of some classified government material , say some leaked documents , some leaked government diplomatic cables and prints those documents . </s>
Well , what has that newspaper done ? Has it exercised its rights under the First Amendment , or has it betrayed the nation ? </s>
And does the answer to that question depend on the consequences of publication ? </s>
Well , let 's argue that out . That 's what we are here for . This is another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . </s>
And on this stage we have two teams of debaters , two tables , two members each . Arguing for the motion , “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets , ” we have Gabriel Schoenfeld , who is author of “Necessary Secrets : National Security , the Media and the Rule of Law , ” and his partner , Michael Chertoff , former secretary of Homeland Security and cofounder of the Chertoff Group . Arguing against the motion that freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets , Alan Dershowitz , the Felix Frankfurter professor of law at Harvard Law School and David Sanger , chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times . </s>
Now , I just want to be clear because there 's a negative in this motion . </s>
It can sometimes be tricky . “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” If you support this motion , you’re leaning more towards the side for secrecy . </s>
If you are against , you 're leaning more towards disclosure and more towards the liberty or license for the press . So I just want to be clear about that because of the next thing I want to say . This really is a debate . </s>
There will be winners and losers in this debate . It 's a contest in which you , our live audience , act as the judges . By the time the debate has ended , you will have been asked to vote twice , once before and once after , to tell us what your view is on this motion , “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” And the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner . </s>
So let 's go to your preliminary vote . If you go to those key pads at your seat , I 'll state the motion again with the caveat that I put in , but I wo n't restate it because I think I confused everybody . “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets , ” if you agree with this motion , press number one . If you disagree , number two , and if you are undecided , press number three . And if you think you made a mistake , just correct it and the system will lock in your last vote . </s>
So we do this in three rounds . The first round is opening statements , seven minutes each by each debater . </s>
Then we have a middle round in which they talk to each other and take questions from you . </s>
And then the third round are brief closing statements and then our final vote . </s>
So onto round one , opening statements by each debater in turn . </s>
Our motion is `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets . '' And arguing for that motion , I 'd like to introduce Gabriel Schoenfeld , senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and author of “Necessary Secrets : National Security , The Media and The Rule of Law.” </s>
And , Gabriel , you are also a chess player , I understand chess master at the U.S . Chess Federation ? That 's right . </s>
So you 've come to play and to win ? Yes . And I can see far ahead as well . Ladies and gentlemen , Gabriel Schoenfeld . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome . </s>
The gravity of the issue we 're debating here tonight can not be overstated . At stake is nothing less than preventing a reprise of the kinds of attacks that befell our city and our country nearly 10 years ago . To keep our country secure , our government inevitably generates a great many secrets of many different kinds . We can not disclose all of the methods by which we track terrorists . We can not publicize the vulnerabilities of our bridges and tunnels and buildings . </s>
We have an absolute duty to conceal things like the blueprints for nuclear weapons or the formulas for substances like aerosolized anthrax . But equally at stake is the character of our democracy . We live in an open society , and secrecy is antithetical to the democratic idea . </s>
Secrecy can be used as a cover for corruption and wrong-doing . </s>
And we depend upon a free press to keep us informed about what our government is doing in our name , including the things that it 's doing in secret , or at least some of them . </s>
And indeed the foreign affairs pages of our major newspapers are filled with stories based upon reporting drawn from state secrets . And that 's the way things are , and that 's the way they ought to be . But even as we have a press that we want to be delving into state secrets , it must do so under the rule of law . </s>
That is the press must be vulnerable to prosecution when it violates the laws governing secrecy . Now here , as Robert Rosenkranz mentioned , we run head long into the First Amendment . The First Amendment says that Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech or the press . </s>
But , of course , we live with numerous abridgments of free speech and free press , all widely accepted by the public and upheld by the courts . </s>
We ca n't libel one another . We ca n't engage in false advertising . And of course , it 's forbidden to yell , `` Fire '' -- falsely yell , `` Fire '' in a crowded theater like this one . Now , Congress has enacted several statutes that criminalize the publication of state secrets . The Espionage Act was mentioned but one might also point to the Atomic Energy Act that makes it a crime to publish classified material pertaining to the design of nuclear weapons . </s>
Or the COMINT Act which makes it a crime to publish classified information pertaining to cryptography , or code breaking , or the Intelligence Identities Protection Act makes it a crime to publish the identities of undercover CIA officers and other intelligence officers of the U.S. government . </s>
Now , these laws are all in obvious tension with the First Amendment , but no court has ever struck them down . And it is a statement of fact , ladies and gentlemen , the proposition under debate here tonight , the freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets , is inarguably true . </s>
Valid laws are on the books that criminalize the publication of certain state secrets . Now , does the existence of such laws mean that every time a journalist like my colleague here , David Sanger , publishes a state secret he should be prosecuted and marched off to prison ? Absolutely not . That would be foolish in the extreme . </s>
That 's why we recognize that our government is promiscuous with the secrecy stamp . It marks lots of things secret that need not be . </s>
And back when I was an editor at Commentary Magazine , I myself published classified information and I would do so again . The real question raised by the proposition is whether the press can and should be prosecuted in those instances when it places the country in danger . </s>
Such danger is not purely hypothetical . Back in the 1970s there was a magazine called Counterspy that began to publish the identities of hundreds of CIA officers around the world . In 1975 , it outed Richard Welch as the CIA Station Chief in Athens . And no sooner was his name disclosed that he was murdered by a Greek terrorist organization as a direct result of that revelation . </s>
Today we have WikiLeaks which in the name of transparency has indiscriminately dumped thousands of secret diplomatic and military cables onto the Internet . Now , some of those documents are innocuous . And many of them without question help us better understand what our government is doing around the world and what other governments are doing , but some of them are outright dangerous . </s>
One WikiLeaks document , a U.S. Army document that they put on the Internet , describes the technical details of the jamming devices used by our soldiers in Iraq to scramble the signals that insurgents were using to detonate roadside bombs . Now , I ask you is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish the secret countermeasures used by our soldiers to keep from getting blown up on the battlefield ? Is there any reasonable person who believes it should be legal to publish blueprints for making nuclear bombs -- or should it be legal to give out the recipe for -- to publish the recipe for making aerosolized anthrax ? Those are questions that I hope we will receive straightforward answers to tonight from David Sanger and Alan Dershowitz . </s>
If they believe those things should be allowed , I hope they 'll fully and frankly acknowledge the costs , and if they think those things should be prohibited by law , well , then they 'll be agreeing with the very proposition that they supposedly came here to oppose . Ladies and gentlemen , freedom of the press does not , can not , and should not extend to state secrets . Not all government secrets warrant protection , but some clearly do . </s>
And if you in the audience agree with what Justice Robert Jackson once memorably said , that the Constitution of the United States is not a suicide pact , I urge you to vote for the proposition at issue here tonight . Thank you . Thank you , Gabriel Schoenfeld . Our motion is `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets , '' and here to speak against this motion , Alan Dershowitz , Harvard law professor and consultant to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange 's legal defense team . </s>
Alan Dershowitz is , as we all know , a great attorney and a celebrity attorney who 's been played at least twice in the movies , you were played in `` Reversal of Fortune '' by the late great Ron Silver in the Klaus Von Bulow story , and in `` American Tragedy , O.J . Simpson Trial , '' you were played by Richard Cox , but interesting , Ron Silver in that movie played Robert Shapiro , so was he upgrading the role or -- All I can tell you is `` Reversal of Fortune , '' having been produced by son , Elon Dershowitz , who is in the audience , is a much better film . Ladies and Gentlemen , Alan Dershowitz . Thank you so much . </s>
Thank you . It 's a distinct pleasure to be arguing with two such distinguished people -- Gabriel Schoenfeld , whose book I reviewed for The New York Times , and reviewed very favorably . And I admire much of what he writes , but we disagree , and you 'll hear the disagreements . And Judge Michael Chertoff , whose work as a public figure deserves all of our appreciation . He has helped protect us for so many years . </s>
And of course , my distinguished colleague who will be arguing on my side . The proposition is far too broad . “State secrets” encompass far too much . And even the criteria used by my opponent -- quote “places the country in danger” -- is far , far too broad . Let me start with a story that one of my dissident clients told me in the 1970s , when I was representing Soviet dissidents in the bad old days of the Soviet Union . </s>
The joke went around during Stalin 's time that a dissident was arrested for the crime of calling Stalin a “fool.” </s>
And he came to court and he said , “I did n't commit a libel . I want to defend myself . I will prove that what I said is truthful.” And he said , “You do n't understand . You 're not being charged with libel . </s>
You 're being charged with revealing a state secret ! ” And that 's precisely the kind of state secret that we often seek to protect . Now , you do n't have to be Stalin . </s>
Remember , everybody knows -- every newspaperman memorizes the famous quote of Thomas Jefferson that he made before he became a president . He said , “Were it left to me to decide whether we should have a government without newspapers or newspapers without government , I should not hesitate a moment to prefer the latter.” </s>
That was pre-presidential Thomas Jefferson . Now let me read you a quote six years into his presidency : “A man who never looks into a newspaper is better informed than he who reads them . And as much as he who knows nothing is nearer the truth than he whose mind is filled with falsehoods and errors.” Thomas Jefferson sought to censor the press . We all know that he opposed the Alien and Sedition Act . </s>
Of course he did , because that was federal legislation . But he supported state legislation that would have censored the press and protected him from embarrassment . Now , you just have to look in today 's New York Times to see how foolish some of these state secrets that are protected tend to be . Finally , finally , the Pentagon papers are about to be declassified and released . </s>
I defended Senator Mike Gravel against the charges of reading the Pentagon papers -- what was it -- 40 years ago ! And Daniel Ellsberg , in today 's Times , I think aptly states the reason why the Pentagon papers were censored for so long . He said , “The reasons are very clearly domestic political reasons , not national security at all . </s>
The reasons for the prolonged secrets are to conceal the fact that so much of the policy making does n't bear public examination . It 's embarrassing or even incriminating.” </s>
You do n't have to be as cynical as Ellsberg -- and Ellsberg is not one of my heroes . I agree with Gabriel Schoenberg 's analysis of Ellsberg for the man . But the point is a very , very important one . Secrets get disclosed all the time . And the issue is not whether secrets will be disclosed . </s>
If you read The New York Times , if you read Bob Woodward , if you read Seymour Hersh , you understand the question is who decides which secrets are disclosed to whom ? When ? Secrets get disclosed . </s>
Bob Woodward has its sources . Why do people talk to Bob Woodward ? </s>
Why do they give him classified information ? Why do they give Seymour Hersh classified information ? Because those are secrets that government officials want to have revealed . So the question is not “Should state secrets be subject to the First Amendment ? ” </s>
The question is , “Should the government -- the executive branch of the government -- be making the decision as to which secrets to withhold and which to reveal ? ” Secrets should be kept . And the primary responsibility for keeping secrets lies with those who have those secrets . If you look , for example , at how WikiLeaks got disclosed , the alleged culprit there is man -- a private named Bradley Manning -- who have never should have had access -- such easy access to the material that he disclosed . That was negligence on the part of the government . </s>
As Julian Assange , I think , aptly put it , “The best way to keep a secret is not to know it.” And if the government wants to keep secrets , they have to do a better job of preventing them from being leaked -- and not put the burden on the press . And by the way , I mean not only leaked WikiLeaks style , but leaked Bob Woodward , Seymour Hersh style , the kind of selective leaks that we 've come to grow accustomed to . There are very limited numbers of secrets that deserve to be protected . And they can be listed and catalogued . </s>
You listed some of them . </s>
I agree with some . I disagree with others . The names of troops , of the nature of weapons . </s>
But you mentioned a couple , for example , methods used to track terrorists , vulnerability of bridges . Those are very complicated . We have a right to know , at least in broad terms , what kinds of methods are being used , whether they 're constitutional or not . We have a right to know if our bridges are vulnerable , not how they 're vulnerable . </s>
These are very , very hard judgments . So you can agree with our side of the proposition while conceding that there are a limited number of things that should be kept secret . </s>
And I believe -- and here we have a real disagreement . You wrote in your book that you would prefer to leave this to the good judgment of prosecutors , the discretion of prosecutors and the common sense of jurors . </s>
What I would prefer to see is a complete starting from scratch with the Espionage Law of 1917 . Scrap it . It tells us nothing . And draft a very narrow statute that says you can not disclose the nature of certain kinds of weapons . </s>
You can not disclose the movement of troops . You can not disclose the names of spies . </s>
That is not state secrets , broad general concept . That 's a limited number of things that need protection , not protection from The New York Times because the Times wo n't publish them , but protection from Internet people who will publish almost anything without any kind of accountability . There must be a strong presumption in favor of freedom of speech and sunshine as the best disinfectant . The government says , `` Trust us . '' No . Do n't trust the government . </s>
The New York Times says , `` Trust us . '' Do n't trust The New York Times . Trust the process of checks and balances , whereby the government tries to keep secrets . The press tries to release the secrets . </s>
That process is the best guarantee of liberty . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Alan Dershowitz . So here 's where we are . </s>
We are halfway the open round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have four debaters , two teams of two fighting it out over this motion , “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” You 've heard two of the opening statements , and now onto a third . </s>
I 'd like to introduce , arguing for the motion that freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets , Michael Chertoff is former secretary of Homeland Security and cofounder of the Chertoff Group . And after a long career in government , lived with the secrets , knows what some of them are . So just between us , because it 's us here , you 're going to share some of it ? You 're not going to hear any secrets from me , John . Michael Chertoff . </s>
Thank you , very much . First , let me again thank you for inviting us to this debate . I think it 's a critical issue for the country . I 'm delighted to be on the same stage with such distinguished scholars and authors . </s>
I think , though , if I 'm not mistaken , that the other side has essentially conceded the proposition for which we are arguing , and that proposition is that freedom of the press has to give way to state secrets . Now , nobody is arguing that the proposition means everything that the government has in its possession is a state secret , nor are we arguing that simply having a single public official asserting that something is a state secret ends the analysis . </s>
But I think where the dispute has come down to is who actually makes the decision . Is it the government and the government process , which is what our contention is and our proposition is , or is it the press . </s>
Does the press get the final say ? </s>
Now , I will agree with Professor Dershowitz that in the first instance , the right way to deal with this problem is for the government to control its own secrets . And most of the time , the government succeeds in doing so . Although the press is constantly making the argument that as a matter of law , they ought to have access to those secrets . </s>
And those arguments are relatively routinely rebuffed . </s>
But the reality is that there are times people do leak secrets . And sometimes they do it for what they may conceive to be noble motives . Sometimes they do it for purposes of settling scores or personal advancement . And sometimes they do it perhaps because they want to hurt the United States . And in those instances , it is not enough to say that because the government has failed to keep the secret , the secret ought to become public and ought to be published widely . </s>
National security and human life can not be the subject of a cat and mouse game . And so I would argue that actually the existing system , which does require freedom of the press to give way to genuine state secrets is pretty much the correct balance . How does that work ? Well , first of all , if the press wants to get a secret in the possession of the government , it 's very difficult to do so . </s>
And there 's a very strong presumption against simply open access to very significant classified material . But we do have cases where the material gets out . And there , I believe the law allows , if the facts are there and the intent is there , a prosecution to take place as a way of deterring somebody from publishing that secret . </s>
And that 's in fact what the law basically is . There are statutes in the books that permit those prosecutions . When the courts have been confronted with those prosecutions , and those are relatively rare cases , the courts have upheld the principles of those prosecutions . </s>
Even in the Pentagon papers case , at least five of the justices and probably seven , indicated that there were instances where a prosecution might be appropriate even if not in that particular case . And even with respect to prior restraint , the issuance of an injunction to prevent publication , most of the justices on the court have acknowledged in the case of a very strong and dangerous release of information , for example , the proverbial publication of information about the movement of a troop ship , it would be appropriate to rejoin the publication of that material . And that 's because the courts recognize that in the government process , a combination of executive action , congressional action and judicial action is the best mechanism for balancing between state secrets and freedom of the press . Now , the press often argues we ought to be the judges . </s>
And the difficulty is that the press is sometimes a flawed judge of what is in the public interest . First of all , the press is not a monolith . As Professor Dershowitz pointed out , we 're not concerned about The New York Times . We 're worried about people who blog . But the First Amendment does n't distinguish between The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal and al Manar , which is the news organ of Hezbollah . </s>
Or extreme blogs on the right or the left . All of those are part of the press . Nor do we want to have the government start to license particular organs as organs that can be trusted and organs that ca n't be trusted . The fact is if we say that state secrets have to give way to the press when the press gets hold of them , then we mean it has to be any member of the press , a blogger , a Hezbollah journalist , somebody who works for a news organ run by the government of a foreign country . And I do n't think any of us believe that would be prudent or safe . </s>
Is the press right even when we deal with the venerable institutions that we 're so familiar with ? Well , the press sometimes also makes mistakes . </s>
Several years ago , there was a publication by The New York Times . I know David Sanger knows about this , of information about a program that allowed the United States government to see what was going on in the financial transactions that were being executed through a program known as Swift . And this was critical in tracking the flow of money that was used to support terrorist activity . Precisely one of the recommendations that was made by the 9/11 commission against the very strong request of the Bush administration , that material was published . And the original argument was , well , this is something people need to know about because it 's potentially illegal or requires some kind of oversight . </s>
But what emerged after a period of time is it was completely legal and that there was nothing wrong about it , and nobody 's privacy had been improperly invaded . Everything was done according to an appropriate process . And therefore , the public ombudsman of The New York Times had to write a retraction . He had to write a piece in the Times saying that while he had originally endorsed the publication of the Swift material , he had changed his mind , and it was not appropriate because it turned out that there was nothing wrong with it , and there was no powerful interest served in releasing that material . And then he made an interesting and telling confession , that he had originally endorsed the disclosure because he did n't like the administration and the way the administration was treating the paper . </s>
And I suggest to you that that 's the problem with having the press make the decision . The press is no more in a position to separate itself from its interests than anybody else . But unlike the organs of government which are accountable to the public and to each other , the press is accountable to nobody . And that 's why I strongly urge you to support the proposition that we 're advocating tonight . </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you , Michael Chertoff . </s>
Our motion is `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets . '' And now here to speak against the motion , David Sanger , who is chief Washington correspondent for The New York Times and was part of the team involved in its WikiLeaks coverage , so you 've , David , printed some secrets in your time . A few . A few . </s>
Well , I hope you 're going to share those with us since the other guy wouldn’t . Ladies and gentlemen , David Sanger . Thank you Thank you very much . And it 's wonderful to be here and to be with such a great panel . In Schoenfeld 's book , if you have n't read it , it 's a wonderful accounting -- historical accounting of the tension between the press and the government . </s>
Michael Chertoff has done a fabulous work and we have talked over many years on many different subjects , and I agree with almost everything that my partner here had to say except when Alan Dershowitz declared that you should n't necessarily trust everything that you read in The New York Times . We’ll take that aside later on . I come to this as a practitioner , not as a legal expert . </s>
And I come to this knowing that the tensions that we are discussing here today are as you 've heard as old as the Republic . The New York Times among other newspapers had reporters embedded with Civil War troops , Union troops , and at one appropriate moment or another , several generals having read the reviews of their strategy , took those reporters and put them in the brig . I 've been around more than a few government officials who have suggested to me over the years as we have debated various stories that we were getting ready to write that what was good for General Sheridan would be perfectly good today . </s>
I would argue that in fact it is impossible , it is impossible to separate out state secrets from what appears every day in The New York Times and other major newspapers around the world . It is impossible because you can not discuss the subject of whether or not we should have gone into Iraq , or how quickly we should get out of Afghanistan , or the issues surrounding cyber war that we deal with each and every day now , without daily venturing into territory that is classified somewhere and somehow . The problem is , as a reporter , I probably do n't even know when much of that material is classified . And I can tell you as someone who went through the WikiLeaks material for many months before The Times and other newspapers published them that I was pretty surprised by some things that were stamped “secret.” I came into the office one day and asked if anybody knew why every American embassy that collects the morning news accounts that would appear in the Spanish press or the Chinese press and collates them and sends them off to Washington so that they would have a sense of what 's appearing in those press reports each day . </s>
Somebody on the way out the door , as they are putting that cable over to Washington , stamps “secret” on them . They had appeared in the newspaper that morning . What does that tell you early on ? It tells you that you can not have a system in which you keep state secrets from being published if almost everything is a state secret . And my friend , Michael Chertoff , points out that the press is a flawed judge of the national interest . </s>
That is absolutely true , but a better judge than the U.S. government because when you read the U.S. government 's own regulations for what gets made classified , what that stamp goes on , the rules only discuss national security considerations . </s>
There is no category that makes the person who 's got that stamp in the hand weigh a public interest . Only the press can do that and only after the information is out . </s>
Now , there 's a second issue around this which the other side pointed out , which is that only the executive , they said , really has the full knowledge to make those decisions . But in fact I think what you heard in the discussion of the constitutional origins of all of this is that the founders believed that to give the executive complete discretion in this area is to create a country that is n't like the America that we know . You would get Egypt under Mubarak ; you would get the Chinese press today . And Americans feel that deeply . Just think about the criticism directed at The New York Times when we failed to go as deeply as we should have into the evidence concerning the justification for going into Iraq . </s>
It would have been wonderful if we could have published more about what the U.S. government knew about whether weapons of mass destruction existed . </s>
Eventually , we were able to . </s>
But at the time we were doing that reporting , it was all deeply classified , except for those tidbits that the U.S. government decided to release to support its own case . Now , we are hardly indifferent , as reporters , to the question of what the consequences of these actions are . We live in New York and Washington . </s>
Our kids ride the subways . We have reporters who are out all across the world . Many have been kidnapped . </s>
A couple , unfortunately , have been killed . A wonderful photographer for The New York Times lost both his legs just a few months ago , stepping on an improvised land mine in Afghanistan . We know that the violent jihadists , who we write about each and every day , have no interest in a free press . And we 're not here to side with them . </s>
We are also not here to be propagandists for the U.S. government . And you do n't want us to be . If you think , briefly , about some of the stories that we have held back on , we held back for a year on the story on warrantless wiretaps that President Bush authorized . Eventually , we published it . </s>
Congress decided to rewrite the law . </s>
We held back for three years -- on a story I worked on for some time -- about a secret U.S. government program to help secure Pakistan 's nuclear weapons . We held the story because the government was fearful that if we published it too soon , we would be giving al-Qaeda or the Taliban directions into how to get to those weapons . </s>
And we published stories that are quite controversial including one earlier this year about Stuxnet , the computer virus that many believe the U.S. government had a role in developing . It was used against the Iranian nuclear program . What possibly could be the interest in that ? Very simple . </s>
If the U.S. government -- if any other government -- is starting off a cyber war , well , we are the country that is most vulnerable to that problem . And we could be subject to attacks in response . So , these are central policy issues . These secrets are not merely published because they are cool stories . </s>
They are published because there is a debate that the public has to conduct . Thank you . Thank you . David Sanger . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate where our motion is “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” </s>
Now , keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening . You 're going to be asked to vote once again at the end . I 'm reminding you that the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . </s>
A couple of other things I just wanted to mention , in terms of this being a radio broadcast , there are some -- -- the only somewhat scripted moments of the evening will be some introductions that I 'll make repeatedly , telling you again and again who I am and who our panelists are , and where we all are , and we know that . And every now and then I 'll say , “We 'll be right back , ” but we wo n't really go anywhere . We 'll all still be here . And between the rounds that we just took , the stations like to take a break . So what I 'd like to do is ask you , when I raise my hand , to burst into such enthusiastic applause that people listening in their cars will think , “These people must be having a great time . </s>
I 'm going to stay and listen to this.” And then we 'll move on to round two . So let 's go do that . </s>
Welcome back to this debate for the Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We 're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . Our motion is “Freedom of the Press does not extend to state secrets.” </s>
We have heard from both sides , the side arguing for the motion : Gabriel Schoenfeld and Michael Chertoff , who are arguing that a press that can publish state secrets without fear of prosecution actually endangers the nation . The team arguing against , David Sanger and Alan Dershowitz , are arguing that yes , there are secrets that should be kept , but it should not be up to the executive of the U.S. government alone to decide which of those secrets are worthy of keeping secret . So we 've heard opening arguments . </s>
And now , the two teams are going to be freer to debate each other and to address one another . And we 'll take questions from you as well in just a few minutes . But I 'd like to start putting to the team that is arguing for the motion -- and this is an argument for greater restriction on press freedom to publish secrets -- do you feel that the press can actually do its job , that your opponent , David Sanger who is with The New York Times , can do his job if he has to face fear of prosecution on a greater -- to a greater degree than he does now ? Michael Chertoff . First of all , I respect David , and I certainly do n't want to suggest he should ever put himself in harm’s way . </s>
But I think the answer to that is yes . Most of the issues which David has talked about can be written about without getting into matters that are state secrets . </s>
First of all , there are times that information is declassified or becomes available from other sources and does n't need to be entered into in great detail . But to give you an example of something that I would argue you should n't be able to do , is in the run-up to the bin Laden raid that resulted in eliminating bin Laden , obviously , it was a compelling public story . And the fact that we were going to be invading another sovereign country and taking military and fatal action against an individual who had not been tried or convicted was a big issue . I think it was a good idea , but others might have disagreed . </s>
And yet had that been leaked in advance , had it gotten into the hands of the press , I would argued it would be quite appropriate for the government to say to David Sanger , “If you publish that , we will prosecute you , and perhaps we will even enjoin you from publishing it.” </s>
But your answer to my question is yes , he can do his job -- Absolutely . I want to come back to David as a practical matter because you are the one who 's practicing . </s>
Can you respond to what you just heard ? Well , certainly the bin Laden raid raises a very good question and is one in which The New York Times has been very clear throughout the time that we went through the WikiLeaks material . Long before that , we have said , as you can see from the examples I cited earlier , that we do not publish stories about operations . We do n't name dissidents who walked into the Chinese embassy and talked to American diplomats . </s>
Where do we draw the line ? </s>
Information that is merely embarrassing as opposed to operational . So the U.S. government , during the midst of the WikiLeaks operation , asked us to withhold the information that the king of Saudi Arabia said in response to a discussion with an American diplomat about Iran 's nuclear program , `` Cut off the head of the snake . '' Now , why did they consider this to be particularly sensitive ? No one was going to go put the king of Saudi Arabia in jail the way a Chinese or Saudi dissident might be put in jail for saying the wrong thing . They considered it sensitive because it would make it more difficult to conduct American foreign policy if the king read his own words in The New York Times or foreign publications . </s>
And so that 's the distinction that I think is critical , the one between an operational secret and embarrassment . And there is no place in the law that makes that distinction . Gabriel Schoenfeld . Well , I find that curious . </s>
Operational secrets -- what is the Swift program ? But an operational program to monitor the finances of al-Qaeda that the Times published against the strong protest not only of the Bush administration but leading Democrats like Lee Hamilton of the 9/11 Commission . And the Times justification for it was always quite murky . Eric Lichtblau , the reporter , one of the two reporters who wrote the story , said in his memoir about it , `` It was , above all else , an interesting yarn . '' </s>
What was the public interest that was served there ? The Times -- the ombudsman of the Times , as Secretary Chertoff pointed out , disavowed the story . So did the general counsel of the Times . So I do n't think that in the final analysis we can just have a system where editors make the -- make such decisions without being subject , vulnerable to prosecution , not necessarily prosecuted , for instance , but vulnerable to prosecution . </s>
Before we get into the weeds on the specifics of the cases , and we will do that , I do want to stay with the question of if you had to work under that threat of prosecution , what would it do to your ability to work ? And maybe your colleague , Alan Dershowitz , would like to take this one . Well , I can tell you that the greatest forms of censorship that take place today are not censorship imposed by the government . </s>
It 's self-censorship resulting from fear of prosecution . </s>
I see that all the time , or fear of libel , other kinds of defamation lawsuits . So clearly it has an impact . </s>
But I 'm not one who thinks that free speech is free or that it comes without costs . In fact , I think we 've heard a very clever debaters ' point here tonight from our opponents , namely that if we concede that there are any conceivable state secrets like the plan to kill Osama bin Laden , then we can see the proposition . That 's absolutely not the case . The proposition is state secrets . </s>
And I submit that you 've conceded our point by changing the debate from state secrets to -- and I quote Judge Chertoff -- to `` Genuine state secrets . '' And you also used a modifier , `` Real state secrets . '' The problem is it 's just too broad . </s>
Now , there are going to be problems . And The New York Times is not the only game in town . </s>
Judge , you mentioned , how about the Hezbollah press ? They might publish it . </s>
Do you think American law is going to stop the Hezbollah press from publishing anything ? </s>
So that 's just a red herring . Okay , Michael Chertoff . But , see , I think this is the point . The point is -- and I do n't think we have to argue that simply calling something a state secret ends the analysis . </s>
What 's important is whether it 's in The New York Times or Hezbollah press or somebody else . If they are in an area where they are dealing with material that is classified and sensitive , they have to make a judgment . </s>
Now , there 's a certain amount of uncertainty . And I understand that may have a chilling effect . But that chilling effect is what imposes a sense of responsibility . </s>
And let me say , everybody in the world who exercises power and authority , lives with the possibility that if they guess wrong , they 're going to wind up in trouble , including , for example , CIA agents who find themselves being investigated , and yet nobody says they should be immune from the possibility of investigation . I just think you 're wrong empirically . </s>
I think you 're wrong empirically . It 's not the fact that people are guessing wrong . </s>
Seymour Hersh is n't guessing . He knows he 's not being prosecuted because he 's revealing a secret that you -- not you personally -- but somebody in the administration gave him on the sly . They say that , `` We know it 's classified , but please print this because it makes us look good . And if you print it , you wo n't be prosecuted . '' </s>
The end result is that people only feel chilled when they release secrets that make the administration look bad . When they reveal secrets that make the administration look good , they are not going to be prosecuted . I 'll give you an example . I 'm a supporter of the Obama administration . I think they handled the post-Osama bin Laden killing miserably . </s>
What did they do ? They revealed the fact that they got computers . </s>
That was a victory lap . Nobody should have ever known that they got computers . They revealed the fact that they got telephone numbers of two guys in Osama bin Laden 's phone book . Nobody should have revealed that . </s>
Why did the Obama administration reveal that ? </s>
They were proud of it . But they didn’t reveal the pictures . Why didn’t they reveal the pictures ? -- -- but I have n't heard -- let me just say for the record , Alan , I have not heard from your side a refutation of their claim that David ca n't do his job without threat of prosecution . And so I mean , that point stays hanging out there and I think leans to their favor . </s>
David ? David ? Let me just make one quick point . No . Let David come in . </s>
Please . </s>
Can I do the job ? Yes . Can I do the job the way all of you want me to do the job ? Probably not . </s>
And that 's because , as you said , there is uncertainty in the system . There 's always going to be uncertainty in this system . But the uncertainty ca n't extend to the point where we are stopping from publishing something that may be published , as Alan points out , outside the country . It may be available in another form , maybe at a U.N. agency , maybe among international nuclear inspectors , and also was classified in the United States . </s>
And we simply will not know . </s>
We can not know what is classified . You have to assume that almost anything on a sensitive subject like this is classified in some way . </s>
And so we have to roll that dice every single day . And we 're willing to take that risk not for us , but because there is a broader readership and citizenship out there -- But Michael said if you roll the dice , and you 're wrong , there are no consequences for you . That 's not true . </s>
Okay . </s>
Now -- why not ? That 's not true . Why not ? I mean , there -- you laid out very clearly what the laws are and what the penalties are . Now , as you may also point out and Schoenfeld does in his book , there has not been a successful prosecution under the Espionage Act against reporters . </s>
There have been against their sources . And part of this is because I think the government recognizes that once you start down that road , it 's very unclear where you draw the line . Okay , Michael Chertoff . I think that illustrates my point , which is , in fact , the proposition is correct . Freedom of the press does give way before state secrets . </s>
And the reason that we can accept that proposition is because we have built a structure that actually is quite protective even within the terms of that proposition . The reason that there have n't been prosecutions of journalists is because people weigh what will happen in a courtroom with a judge and a jury . And so when you do your job in a close case , if you feel you 're acting in good faith , you can have a reasonably high degree of confidence that if it does n't wind up in a prosecution , you can go to court , and you 're going to wind up prevailing in front of a judge and a jury . And that 's the worst possible result because what it says -- </s>
Alan Dershowitz . -- is if The New York Times , if you 're Seymour Hersh , if you 're Bob Woodward , you have nothing to worry about . But if you 're Julian Assange , and you 're not working under the supervision of the government , if you 're not somebody who has a constant relationship with the government , you have plenty to worry about . </s>
It gives the government far too much discretion to go after people who reveal information that is not something they want revealed . And I think , frankly , you 're asking the wrong question . Can he do the job ? That 's a terrible criteria under the First Amendment . We can change it and say , could we have literature without there being sex ? </s>
Of course we can . We can have Shakespeare . But that 's never been the criteria under the First Amendment . Can you do your job ? </s>
That shifts the presumption and the burden to the press to justify that it can do its job . The answer is , is there a constraint , a lawful and -- constraint on the way the press does its job , and I think the answer to that is there 's far too much discretion in the government to decide who to go after for leaking and who not to , and that 's very dangerous . And actually I think Alan -- </s>
Gabriel -- let 's let Gabriel . It may be dangerous for leakers but it certainly -- the historical record is not one of danger for the press . There 's never been a successful prosecution of journalists as David Sanger just noted . And the one case , I 'm wondering what you think about it , that where there was -- a prosecution was initiated , The Chicago Tribune case in World War II where the government -- where The Chicago Tribune published a front page story strongly suggesting that we had broken the Japanese naval codes , a leak that could have cost the lives of tens of thousands of U.S. servicemen . Now , there are plenty of people , journalists who think that there should n't -- that there should n't have been a prosecution , but , I mean , that seems to me almost madness . </s>
Well , first of all there have been many , many prosecutions not under that particular statute but you 've heard about shouting `` fire '' in the crowded theater . Do you know what the facts were of that case ? There was a guy who was handing out leaflets in front of a draft board , telling people to consider whether or not they might have a constitutional right to be a conscientious objector . </s>
And Oliver Wendell Holmes , in the worst analogy ever constructed by the legal mind -- -- turned that into shouting fire in a crowded theater . The analogy was handing out a leaflet outside of a burning theater , saying , “Please do n't go in there , it might be unsafe to you , ” and he turns out to be wrong . Gabriel Schoenfeld . You’re changing the subject , we 're talking here about a disclosure that could have cost the lives if tens of thousands of people , should the government go after a newspaper in a case like that or in a case like the Swift case where real-time operational intelligence is jeopardized about people who are trying to blow up our subways . Well , you know -- </s>
Wait , let 's -- David Sanger . Let’s take Gabe’s question right on because these are decisions we have to make every day . During the run up to the Iraq War , the Bush administration said repeatedly that they had made no decision and had no plans to invade Iraq . The New York Times discovered over the July 4th holiday in 2002 that there was a very detailed plan to invade Iraq . </s>
And it published that fact with just enough detail to make it clear that in fact the Bush administration had put together a plan , but not quite enough detail to actually tell Saddam Hussein what that plan looked like . </s>
Now , there were many in the Bush administration at that time who were calling for the prosecution of The New York Times . I think The New York Times served an enormously important public interest there by making it clear to the public that no matter what government officials were saying in public to them , in fact they had a plan based on what we now know was fairly loose evidence , to invade a foreign country . </s>
But isn’t -- Michael Chertoff . </s>
But does n't that actually illustrate the point we 've been making , that the restrictions in place do allow a judgment to be made about whether something will cross the line or not because -- </s>
We sure did n't know that at the time . Well , sure , you did because you were able to predict that you have -- you know what the track record of the law is , you know that if a decision is made to prosecute , you 're going to have a jury and a judge and you 'll be able to make an appeal to them , and all of those allow you some freedom of movement , but not absolute freedom of movement . </s>
The flipside of it is to go back to the bin Laden case and maybe The Times would n't have published it , but there might be other news organs that would , if a news organ had gotten a hold of the plan to put SEALs into Abbottabad and they had been able to consider publishing that without any fear of being prosecuted or being enjoined , with absolute impunity , would that be where we want to see the United States ? I suggest if you go back to the very quote that Gabriel made earlier about the Constitution not being a suicide pact , giving that absolute protection would be devastating for the United States . I think there 's an answer to that . Alan Dershowitz . If a newspaper learned about the fact that the SEALs were preparing to attack bin Laden , then that attack should have been aborted . </s>
You have n't been keeping your secrets well enough . You ca n't depend on a newspaper 's discretion to put the lives of brave American SEALs at risk . So if you find out that a newspaper has that report , you have to abort . </s>
Sometimes -- Are you saying , Alan , that the newspaper would have a duty to print that ? Well , let me give you a story . </s>
Jimmy Reston did n't print the story of the Bay of Pigs invasion because he wanted to protect Americans and Cubans . The Bay of Pigs Invasion was a disaster for America and a disaster for Cuban patriots . </s>
And what did President Kennedy say to them later ? I wish you had printed it . And if The Times had printed that , we might have averted a disaster . </s>
You do n't know in advance . Look , the SEALs thing might have gone wrong . By that logic -- Gabriel Schoenfeld . And by that logic , Professor Dershowitz , The Times should have published , if it had known in advance , that we were about to make the raid on bin Laden . </s>
If -- Because it could have gotten wrong . And then we would have to abort the operation ? If in fact The Times learned that it was a bad plan and that it was an illegal plan , and they decided to publish it , and we had to abort it , that would be a very , very good example of the interplay between -- No , it would be -- </s>
-- the press and the executive . </s>
-- an example -- Michael Chertoff . </s>
I do n't think -- Alan , let Michael -- let Michael get to that point . </s>
Michael Chertoff . Thank you . I think it would be an example of taking away from the three branches of government the authority to make decisions about securing the United States , which was , in many ways , the reason the Constitution was formed -- was to make this effective and to hand it over to the press . </s>
And not probably just The New York Times . It could be any organ of the press . </s>
And the last point I have to make on this is that the press is so concerned about the possibility of chilling because an injunction or prosecution for leaking national security secrets . If you take copyrighted material from another news organ , and you publish it without permission , you can be sued , you can be prosecuted . Not for the ideas , only for the words . Right . Exactly . </s>
Okay . That 's different . Does that -- and that happens from time to time -- does that cause The Times to enter into a state of paralytic hysteria ? </s>
I think you 're missing -- briefly , I think you 're missing my point . They live with that threat of being -- </s>
My point about -- about the Osama bin Laden is that The Times had learned about it . That would mean there is a real possibility that others would know about it . And that 's an important decision for the government to know about . It 's like the canary and the coal mine , I assume ? </s>
Right . Well , no . It 's -- you know , the risk -- the government should n't let The New York Times find out about secrets like that . </s>
We have -- Let 's talk about how this would actually have played out . Hundreds of people are involved in a military operation like that . Yeah . Thousands of people are involved -- </s>
Right . -- in other secrets . 2.5 million Americans hold security clearances . Eight hundred thousand of them -- </s>
That 's the problem . -- hold top secret clearances . With populations of that size , you 're going to have people who disagree with the government , people who might be deranged , people who are going to leak secrets . </s>
We can not -- How many people do you think knew about the Osama bin Laden raid ? Let 's go back to the -- All right . </s>
All right , David Sanger . David Sanger , New York Times . </s>
Dozens -- maybe hundreds knew about it . It did n't leak , and I 'm very glad that it did n't . And The New York Times did n't have to make that decision . Right . How would this have played out in real life ? </s>
I suspect with The New York Times , for all the reasons I 've laid out before , would not have published that fact . But when the phone call was made to the White House to say , “We have heard this , ” my guess is that what would have played out is exactly what Alan suggested . </s>
The operation probably would have been aborted , just for the fact that we made that phone call . And that tells you a little bit about how the system works in reality . Well , you 're surely not going to argue , David , that the purpose of giving the press immunity is to allow them to play a kind of red teaming on government operations . Certainly not . Because for example , with Swift , Swift was working perfectly well until we -- </s>
Michael , just two sentences reminding people of what Swift was . Swift was the program that allowed the U.S. government to track the flow of money to terrorists on a global basis , which was exactly what the 9/11 Commission recommended . And it was a very useful and important program . And it was n't failing . And the revelation of the program ultimately led to it becoming much less effective . </s>
And there -- were there issues of illegality of any kind ? And no issues of illegalities , The Times itself conceded . So there was a minimal public interest . </s>
This was n't exposing criminality . What about the plans for weaponizing anthrax or for coming up with biological weapons ? </s>
Would you take the argument that if we publicize those plans , that shows that the information is out there , therefore let 's disseminate it widely so people can begin to cook up bacterial anthrax in their garage ? I think the logic in this refutes itself . Okay . </s>
Wait , we have to take a break . And when we come back , we 'll take questions from the audience . Welcome back . We 're an Intelligence Squared debate from -- let me do that again . </s>
Can you give me another round of applause , because I -- We 're back to this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
Our motion is “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” Debating for the motion , in support of the motion , Gabriel Schoenfeld and Michael Chertoff . Against , Alan Dershowitz and David Sanger . And I 'd like now to go to our audience to ask questions that will move this debate along on the topic itself , which once again is “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” And if you just raise your hand , there 's a woman in a black dress ? </s>
If you can hold it about that -- that 's perfect . Thank you . </s>
So , is the against side saying that the press should never be prosecuted for any publishing of state secrets -- any state secrets ? Is that the position ? That was a question the question , yes . </s>
David Sanger . As a reporter , I would hope -- I would hope the prosecution would n't happen . But the reality is that you have to establish a system in which the secrets that America is protecting are real secrets , like the bin Laden example that we were using before . </s>
But instead , we live in a system in which there are millions of pages classified each and every day . </s>
And you ca n't have a press that is living forever in the fear that the publication of any piece of data could lead to an equivalent prosecutorial discretion on this issue . And so if you 're going to truly not devalue the point of the realm , if you 're going to say there are some things that the United States really needs to protect , it 's got to be a very , very narrow list . And that is not where the U.S. government is going . </s>
In fact , the amount of classified data expands dramatically every single year . </s>
Michael Chertoff . </s>
Well , I think the answer to the question then was , essentially as the question you 're asked , you can see that there obviously are occasions when the press should be prosecuted for publication . For publication of -- Of state secrets . </s>
And the issue then becomes -- Or some state secrets . And the argument that David makes is , but the problem is it 's too hard because there 's too much classified material . And yet the facts show that when it comes time to make the decision to prosecute , government historically , whether it be Republicans or Democrats , have been very , very conservative and cautious in actually prosecuting . </s>
And that tells me the system works , that in fact the government does n't overreach on prosecution and that it is possible to have a workable system where people who are responsible journalists know where they ca n't go , like the bin Laden case , and the irresponsible ones , dare I say Assange , may find themselves in a different -- And who decides who 's responsible and irresponsible on the basis of what criteria ? </s>
The issue is whether or not somebody should be punished for publishing state secrets . </s>
The answer to that is clearly no , not for publishing state secrets . If you want to have a list of things that can be published , that 's a very different criteria . </s>
You yourself conceded all three branches of government have to be involved . </s>
At the moment , the legislative branch has n't been involved . They have punted . They have simply said , broadly defined state secrets , the Espionage Act . That has to be scrapped . And if you want to have six , nine , four specific categories of things that ca n't be published , that 's an interesting debate , and I think both of us would acknowledge . </s>
But not to punish people for violating state secrets - - Gabriel Schoenfeld . -- that sounds like other countries which have -- Come in , Gabriel . </s>
The legislature -- the legislature has not punted . </s>
We do have highly specific laws on the books . The direct question was put to you , Mr. Sanger , would you prosecute -- should the press be prosecuted when it violates those sanctions , when it violates those particular statutes ? </s>
If the press publishes , for example , the identities of an intelligence agent , CIA agent , do you believe that the press should be prosecuted ? </s>
If the press publishes designs of nuclear weapons , as the Progressives tried to do in 1979 , is there a basis for prosecution ? </s>
There may well be a basis for prosecution . But the judgment for doing that runs a much greater risk , which is the chilling effect risk . And there are certainly a very limited number of things for which I could imagine why the U.S. government would get in and truly seek to prosecute . The fact that they have n't tells you that they seem to know already that this is an unsustainable legal regime for the very reasons that Alan has laid out , that there is nothing in the law that distinguishes between that very narrow group of true state secrets which we can all put a list together and probably the list you could count on both hands . And that vast majority of material that is covered under those very laws you described . </s>
Can I ask a question of you ? </s>
Would you be prepared to abolish the Espionage Act of 1917 with its broad characterizations and just limit prosecution to those particular statutes that you talked about , naming spies , naming intelligence ? </s>
Then we have an interesting debate . The problem is the current statutory criterias , the worst of all possible worlds , it gives enormous discretion , and it gives the very government whose secrets are being released , the discretion and the power to decide not to go after The New York Times , they like them -- Michael Chertoff , do you want to answer the question ? -- but to go after Assange , they do n't like him . Again , I mean , I hate to say it . </s>
I think that gives the whole game away . So if we agreed that the Identities Protection Act , if we agree the Communications and Cryptographic Act which are very specific -- Right . </s>
-- that those appropriate , that prosecutions are appropriate . Then I think you 've conceded that in fact state secrets ought to be sufficient to make the - - Let 's go to another question from the audience . Right in the center there . Yep . </s>
We did that . </s>
That 's you . </s>
Is the for side basically saying that the statement is correct that needs a big caveat of a wise judiciary system ? No . I think what the for side is saying is that the statement is correct in the context of the government system in which we operate . That 's why saying , well , you know , this is -- we do n't want to become like Egypt or Russia , that 's not the context in which the proposition is offered . </s>
The proposition is offered in the context of our current system of government in which part of the protection for the press is not just , quote , `` Freedom of the press in the First Amendment . '' But it is the structure of government that says if you actually want to take the step of prosecution , you 've got to have an executive decision to prosecute . You 've got to judge who will consider Alan Dershowitz 's arguments about whether the law is properly written , and you 'll have a jury of 12 people like you who will make the final decision . And in that context the proposition , I think , makes the unassailable point that freedom of the press has to be balanced against and in some instances give way to state secrets . And the worst possible solution is to give -- </s>
Alan Dershowitz . -- the very same government that is being offended the power to make that decision . And if you think you can count on juries , just remember how juries operated during the McCarthy period . Remember how juries operate during times of crisis . </s>
The First Amendment was built to protect the most unpopular , the most hated during the worst periods of our history . And discretion is not going to serve that protection . </s>
Gabriel Schoenfeld . </s>
-- solid laws . We need -- let me give you the -- No , no , no . Let -- no , no . </s>
Gabriel -- Gabriel Schoenfeld . Gabriel Schoenfeld , please . </s>
Thank you . I have the microphone . I have the microphone . Even if we take your suggestion , and scrap the Espionage Act , which I would have trouble trusting the current Congress to do a better job than the one that wrote it in 1917 -- </s>
They could n't do a worse job . But even if we did that , and we had a new set of laws that somehow managed to enumerate the very complex set of things that have to be protected . </s>
It 's not just a little list of six , by the way . You still -- if you had new laws , you 'd still have juries , and you 'd still have prosecutors using their discretion . </s>
That 's built into our system . It 's not a perfect system . </s>
Name a better one . Let me tell you . </s>
Let me name a better one . We should have a rule that says you can not , under any circumstances , publish the name of spies . And if The New York Times does it , they must be prosecuted . If WikiLeaks does it , they must be prosecuted . No room for discretion . </s>
David , do you want those rules ? No prosecutorial discretion , period . David Sanger , do you want those sorts of rules ? I 'm sorry ? Would you want those sorts of rules spelled out so clearly ? </s>
I wouldn’t be happy with specific rules because I know that as situations evolve , you 're going to discover that that list is going to leave both sides unsatisfied . That 's why we 're dealing with an Espionage Act that was written in 1917 that we do n't think fits the modern world . But it would certainly be better to have a very narrow list like that than what we are living with today . </s>
Because what we 're living with today would allow the government of the United States under extreme circumstances , and I 'm not saying it would happen in the current political environment , but you 've got to think when you do this about a political environment into the future , in which they could prosecute for almost anything that you read in the national security coverage pages of The New York Times in each and every day . And when the law is written that broadly , it simply becomes devalued over time . But as you have said , the government tends not to prosecute . Fortunately , the government so far does tend not to prosecute . </s>
So you can not -- you ca n't count on that , and that 's -- It 's a very high hurdle . It 's a very high hurdle prosecuting a journalist under the Espionage Act . And they have to show bad faith on the part of the journalist , intent to injure the United States . </s>
No , no , no , no . That 's -- wait . Let me , let me finish . </s>
But I want to just return back to this question of the raid on Osama bin Laden . Which you say the Times would not have printed if it had known in advance , would not have wanted to jeopardize that example that the American forces . But just a few minutes before that , you were saying you were applauding the fact that the Times should have published in advance the Bay of Pigs operation . Which is it ? It 's a very -- -- a very basic answer to that question . </s>
The Times did not publish the Bay of Pigs operation . And what happened was the president of the United States turned around later on and said , “Gee , I wish you would have.” The Times has not published many other operational cases like that . </s>
Is that always a good judgment ? Not necessarily . The -- The problem that we 're dealing with here is that mistakes are going to be made on both sides , and the question is where do we want the law to weigh the errors ? And the answer to my mind is we want to err on the side of disclosure . That 's what the First Amendment is all about . </s>
You do n't want to err on the side of -- -- if you could stand up just -- Yeah , right there , that 's right , thank you . It seems to me that part of this argument is coming down to sort of , you know , if there is discretion , then there almost inevitably will be discrimination , sort of if there is discretion then it 's hard to say even what the law is . I 'm confused by this sort of hard line rule that you guys seem to be going over , this idea that disclosing the name of CIA agents is somehow maybe something that should be absolutely prohibited . </s>
But should it be prohibited even when the name is revealed by an employee of the White House ? You know -- And on to Dershowitz , I 'm sorry , I do n't think the rule could be that firm , but on the other hand then there 's this question of what is a secret ? After a White House employee has leaked the secret , is it still a secret ? You said that -- Okay , all right , Michael Chertoff , that 's a great question actually -- </s>
And I think that illustrates exactly why I think the current system works not perfectly but as well as you can have in human existence . The current system as you point out in the question recognizes that there 's never an absolute . There are probably some times that you could reveal the identity of an agent when it 's out there already , and you could argue that there 's really no impact . </s>
There are other times when you 're reviewing other kinds of information that would be terribly devastating or damaging , again , recipes for certain kinds of weapons or for the revelation of certain kinds of operational plans . </s>
And the key is in all of these situations what we do is we have a system for resolving a prosecution because we involve people like sitting in this room and 12 jurors in the box , and that is the protection that we have that in the end the law will be applied reasonably and a reasonable application of the law is the best defense . </s>
A rigid application is one which is likely to wind up with exactly the kind of conundrum -- -- Well , here we really have a difference because I think you need Alan Dershowitz . -- rigid application when it comes to the First Amendment . The First Amendment says , no , juries do n't get to decide that because juries and the people like to ban things when they’re very , very unpopular . </s>
The Constitution prohibits that , just like the Constitution prohibits discrimination against the most absurd of all religions . </s>
And we ca n't have that kind of discretion . </s>
The rule has to be items ca n't be published , the names , that might be too broad or too narrow , if The Times publishes it , they can be prosecuted . If the White House publishes it , they can be prosecuted . And if WikiLeaks publishes it , they can be prosecuted . The same law has to apply to all . You 're saying nobody is in danger because there is no prosecution . </s>
There is currently in Virginia a grand jury investigation directed against WikiLeaks and directed against Assange , not against The New York Times . But is n't that a great example -- And the defense is going to be essentially -- Is n't that a great -- The Times published this , too . </s>
You 're not going after them . Oh , no , you don’t go after The Times , we go after WikiLeaks because they don’t have the power -- Okay , Michael Chertoff . Alan , is n't that a great example -- I did n't want to bring up the WikiLeaks , but since you have I will . Sure . </s>
Is n't that a great example of the fact that attributing ill motive to juries or to prosecutors or to the government omits the fact that there can be ill motive on the publisher ? In the case of Assange , it 's reported that his purpose in leaking the information as he told his associates is because he wants to make it impossible for the U.S. government to function by making it impossible for secrets to be held , so that people can’t have conversations . So he 's motivated by ill will to the United States . </s>
Now , is this the man we want to trust if God forbid he got a hold of the bin Laden attack plan , do we want to trust him to exercise his judgment ? And do we want to trust -- Or would we rather trust people like those in this room ? </s>
No , do we want to prosecute -- or do we want to trust the prosecutor who misstates what Assange said and what his motive was , because he does n't like Assange ? `` Assange , I do n't like , we 're going to go after him . </s>
Times I like , we 're going to go after him . '' If you leave this to motive analysis , do we know what the motive of The New York Times is ? Is it to sell advertising ? </s>
Is it to be powerful ? </s>
Is it to help the government ? A motive analysis , to be limiting freedom of the press would mean the end of the First Amendment . Okay , we 're going to take a break . </s>
Our motion is `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets . '' We 'll be back with this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate in just a moment . Okay , we are back . Our motion is `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets . '' I jumped the gun . </s>
We are back at this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . Our motion is `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets . '' We 're taking questions from the audience . Sir , could you stand ? Thanks . </s>
Sure . First of all , thank you very much for being here . Obviously this is not a debate of absolutes -- it seems that the point of discretion keeps coming up over and over again . So , framing the debate in discretion is a question of who do you really trust ? </s>
When there can be abuses on both sides , who has the most information to make that decision ? The press is a very broad category , ranging from very established newspapers to bloggers . </s>
So with all possibilities of abuse with government -- cover-ups , perhaps , or misinformation and trouble with information flow -- who has the most information to make the decision and where is the greater risk ? As much as I love the First Amendment , I’d like to pose the question . David Sanger . Well , I think -- </s>
Michael , let me let David take that first -- Oh , sorry . -- and then I 'll come to you . Clearly , as any government official will happily tell you , they 've got a wider range of information than the newspapers do . The reporter may be looking at a single document . </s>
WikiLeaks was the great exception -- it was 250,000 documents and four million words - - but usually , leaks are in dribs and drabs . And the government would make the argument that they are in a much better position to judge . That would be a very convincing argument , if in fact , the government , when doing its classification , had to do in a serious , credible way , a measure between security risk and public 's right to know . But the fact of the matter is -- as someone in the CIA said to me just last week -- no one ever got fired for stamping “classified” on a piece of paper . </s>
You know -- Michael Chertoff . -- I would say the question you 're -- I 'd like to actually suggest you come up and -- he 's done a very good job of succinctly stating , I think the case for the proposition . In the end , there is going to be mistake and error and potentially ill will on both sides . </s>
What Dave is arguing is that because the initial process of classifying is less than perfect and can be overbroad , that means that we have to throw the whole system out and the press has to have , essentially , free run . My argument is that instead of looking at only one part of the process , let 's look at the whole process . If we come to the point of a prosecution , it 's not just going to be the person who classified who is going to be part of that decision . </s>
It 's not just going to be the prosecutor . In the end , it 's going to have to be presented to a judge and a jury . There will be multiple of layers who have the opportunity to bring their judgment to bear on whether the decision to publish was right or violated the law . And that to me is the greatest protection of all . And -- because I have faith in the public and the courts and the entire process , I would rather trust that than Julian Assange to make that decision . </s>
Another question from the audience . I 'll let you take this one , Al . Sir , yeah . You just did that . </s>
Thanks . Yes . That 's right . </s>
I must say , the remark you made about if the press had got to know about the bin Laden , they could have the decision whether it was a good plan or bad plan , and then published it -- -- and then they would have to abandon the whole plan , I found that a little bit frightening , because like was made obvious just now , who has more information about that plan ? </s>
I would think it was more -- But , sir , what would be your question to this ? </s>
The question I -- Why are they wrong ? </s>
Yeah . The question I wanted to ask is is this not more about -- not just state secrets but state security that we entrust the press with ? When you hear -- when you read statements in the press about how vulnerable the New York underground is to terrorism , how vulnerable our water supplies are , do you not think that you 're giving away -- Are you saying this discussion in the press is making the world more dangerous for us ? </s>
Yes . Is that your question ? Definitely . That’s the question . </s>
I 'll let David take it , then you . No , actually I told you you 'd go next . Alan Dershowitz . Well , I want to know if our water supply is vulnerable . I want to know if our infrastructure is vulnerable . </s>
I suspect there are enemies who already know that , and the issue about -- I think there 's a lot of misunderstanding about what I said about the bin Laden raid -- I supported the bin Laden raid . I think it was legal . I think it was legitimate . I think we did a good job . </s>
I think we did a terrible job right after it in what information we revealed and what information we withheld . My only point was , if the United States government ca n't keep a secret like that , and if The New York Times learns about it , or Hezbollah learns about it , the press learns about it -- we have to really , seriously think about whether this is an operation you want to have go forward . What worries me most is the attitude I 've heard from some of the questions -- the government knows more than we know . </s>
We , the government , know better . You hear that from every tyrannical regime in the world . The government knows better . We live in a system where the government has to be checked by the press , where the press is checked by the government , where we have confusion , uncertainty , we have no ability to really know in advance how it will come out . </s>
We do n't know whether it would be a good thing or a bad thing . In retrospect , it was a good thing that bin Laden was killed and that the press did n't reveal it . It might have come out differently . We do n't know . What we need are rules . </s>
And the rules that we have now -- David -- Alan , you have made that point , and I want to get to what this man 's question was to David . Does this sort of thing make the world more dangerous for us ? This discussion -- he was talking more broadly about security . </s>
Everybody might figure out that the subways are vulnerable . Sure . </s>
But he 's asking , I think , whether the broad discussion and the divulging of secrets makes the world more dangerous . And my answer to that would be , in many cases , it makes the world significantly safer , because the government is feeling some pressure , the U.S. government , to take a system that they may not have focused on entirely well and actually make it better . Let me give you an example that comes right from Mr. Chertoff 's time when he was at Homeland Security . President Bush would frequently laud the fact that imports into the United States go through nuclear detectors that were put at every port . And everyone knew , including many of the importers , that these nuclear detectors did not deal well with anything that was shielded . </s>
In other words , you could put through a lot of different material through the port of Los Angeles , and these detectors were frequently set off by kitchen tables , by Chinese toilets . Nuclear weapons , that was another issue . Now , at some point , many newspapers got around to writing about that . </s>
Did we put the United States at greater danger ? No . I think in fact what we did was prod the U.S. government to move faster with the technology it needed to go get in place . Michael Chertoff . But actually , that illustrates my point because factually , David , what actually happened was I testified about the fact that these were -- </s>
Eventually , you did , yes . Not eventually , up front . And that 's the point , to answer the question . The government often itself will reveal , in a general sense , what the limitations are . In the case of these devices , it was that shielded material could not be detected . </s>
You had to add an additional device . Where I think there is a greater danger is if you get to a certain level of specificity . For example , if you want to talk about general vulnerability in the New York subway system , you can argue that that 's not harmful . It 's even helpful . </s>
If you want to say there 's a particular location where a bomb would cause a crippling devastating blow to the operation of the system , that , I think , would make us unsafe , and that should be a state secret . </s>
And that 's really what we 're arguing for with this proposition . </s>
And we should add that -- Gabriel Schoenfeld . -- the other side has not really addressed this whole very striking example of the Swift program , where the Times revealed an ongoing operational intelligence-gathering program directed at al-Qaeda 's finances . </s>
And it 's true that the treasury secretary had mentioned that , in general terms , we were tracking their finances . </s>
But it certainly , until that story appeared in -- So you put this out three times . </s>
One chance to respond . Absolutely . Do you want to respond , was the Times wrong to report on the Swift program ? </s>
Was anything gained from public interest ? The Times was not wrong to report on it because the Swift program had been written about in many forms over many years before and after al-Qaeda became a significant source and issue . That is the only way international transactions flow and get cleared . </s>
And it was obvious to anybody who had read anything in any detail about how international transactions are going that that 's where they go through . But let 's assume for a moment -- Alan Dershowitz . </s>
-- that the Times was wrong . You did n't prosecute the Times . You do n't have the guts to prosecute the Times . </s>
You will never prosecute the Times . I actually do . You were a bunch of bullies . You would go after -- </s>
You said you agree with that , Mike ? -- only the weakest and the most vulnerable . No , actually , I -- The First Amendment is not about The New York Times . </s>
The First Amendment is about Drudge . The First Amendment is about extremist newspapers and magazines that are very unpopular . The First Amendment is about people who could never win a case in front of a jury . </s>
That 's who the First Amendment 's about . I do n't worry about The New York Times . They can defend themselves . They knock down trees by the forest fulls . Governments do n't go after -- </s>
All right . A couple more questions . -- newspapers like The New York Times . Sir , if you can come -- you 're in the first row without light . </s>
If you could come down to the steps , I 'll take you second . You 're wearing a white shirt , just so that you could come into where the TV lights can see you . Anybody on this side in the meantime ? Yeah ? You were half-hearted . </s>
I want somebody full-hearted . </s>
All right . Why do n't you just -- can they -- can the camera catch that ? You 're good ? Yeah . </s>
Okay , go ahead , sir . Since we all have to vote at the end of this , I really want to come back to the specific language in the motion and how I should be interpreting this because I want both sides to really argue for the votes of those of us who believe that some states -- the freedom of the press does not extend to some state secrets . So it seems to me that the side for is interpreting this to mean freedom of the press does not extend to some state secrets , and the other side is interpreting it to mean that all state secrets and is disagreeing with it . So which way is it ? Well , I -- as the proponents -- </s>
Michael Chertoff . -- I think we say -- it does not say all state secrets . It says some state secrets . </s>
Or state secrets . You 're right . </s>
I 'm looking for the word `` some '' there . I 'm sorry . I misspoke . But let me explain what I mean . We do n't , as I said up front , we do n't argue that everything that the government does is a state secret . </s>
We argue that some things are state secrets and that the reason the freedom of press has to give way is because there is a process for adjudicating what is state secrets that works , a process that requires , before there is punishment , that you go through a decision to prosecute , a judge winds up weighing in on it , and a jury winds up resolving it . And that under that circumstance , existing set of laws that do inhibit freedom of the press for state secrets work and ought to be kept . </s>
I believe my adversaries are arguing the existing set of laws are too discretionary , and we ought to have a recipe list , and only things in the recipe list ought to be prosecuted . So did that help you with your vote . Okay . </s>
But they were agreeing with Michael . Well -- Okay . Go ahead , Alan . </s>
Alan , go ahead . Well , no , I think -- I think the motion puts the burden on the proponents of the motion to justify the censorship of state secrets based on the term and the criteria `` state secrets . '' We are opposed to that . We concede that there are certain pieces of information that if properly legislated , and if discretion is reduced , and if anybody publishes them , they should be prosecuted . </s>
We concede that . </s>
But the broad criteria of state secrets , as reflected by the Espionage Act of 1917 , is far too discretionary and far too broad . And the basic issue is , should there be a presumption in favor of publication ? That 's our position . Should there be a presumption against publication , that 's their position . David Sanger . </s>
You know , I think the WikiLeaks trove goes a long way toward answering your question . Everything in the trove that was downloaded and released and would have appeared around the world , even if The New York Times and no other American newspaper touched it , because it was n't being published in the United States initially , every one of those documents was marked `` secret , '' 250,000 documents . </s>
And what did the second of defense , Robert Gates , say about the damage done from their revelation ? </s>
Well , he said , it was a bit overblown . Was there damage ? </s>
Sure . There have been several U.S. ambassadors who 've had to be recalled . There 's been a lot of embarrassment all around . </s>
But the state has survived six months later . And we learned a lot about American diplomacy along the way that was pretty important , including some things that Julian Assange did not want the United States to conclude , including the fact that our diplomats write pretty nicely . That cost was -- but that price was worth paying . Yes . I would n't have come here to participate in a debate arguing for the proposition -- </s>
Gabriel Schoenfeld . </s>
-- that we should prosecute any , all state secrets . That would be an absurdity . I agree with our opponents here that the government wildly over-classifies and misclassifies , and that 's a chronic problem . </s>
It 's a problem that 's not going to be reformed any time soon . But it means that there are categories of genuine secrets . That what we 're talking about here . </s>
And what 's ultimately at stake is that we live in a regime in which , in the final analysis , it 's the democratic system , our Congress , the executive branch and the courts that get to decide which secrets are protected . </s>
One more question . Sir , right in the front . As someone who has actually published state secrets and been taken to court for it , I would like to -- and for purely political reasons , I find all of this , four guys dancing around the head of a pin . Michael Chertoff came closest when he said that some state secrets are worthy of protection , and others are not . And the question is really among you , who should decide that . </s>
And I think you actually all agree that this is a debate about who should decide . I think that 's right . The question is -- the question has been decided by our Congress , which has created a set of statutes , the Espionage Act and the other statutes I have mentioned , the Atomic Energy Act . </s>
And then the executive branch gets to carry out , enforce those statutes . </s>
And we live in a very liberal regime . In our whole history we 've never had a successful prosecution of a journalist , and only one attempted prosecution . So I do n't think there 's much of a chilling effect , but the basic principle is in place . Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets because the government has the final word ; the jury has the final word . Thomas Jefferson once said , `` The law should be so crystal clear that you should be able to understand it if you read it while running . '' </s>
And there is nothing vaguer than the Espionage Act of 1917 . It gives the government total power to decide who to prosecute . </s>
Thus far , they have exercised their discretion during peacetime relatively well , during wartime very , very poorly , and the risks of greater prosecution during times of increasing crisis increase . </s>
We need to have rules of law , not counting on the discretion of prosecutors , the discretion of juries to protect our First Amendment . It 's just too valuable . If we want to have a debate about the Espionage Act , I would think we 'd probably be in agreement . It 's a very vague act . </s>
It 's -- </s>
So would you favor its abolition ? Would you favor its abolition ? -- its reform . </s>
But I do n't feel -- but I think it 's very difficult to reform -- Very quickly . -- but I favor the basic principle . </s>
Very quickly for Michael Chertoff . I do think the questioner absolutely put the question that really is dividing us , which is who decides ? And I would argue and I think our proposition will be at the end of today that it is the combination of Congress having passed the law , the executive branch making its decision to prosecute , and the judge and the jury , you people , deciding whether to convict or not . That 's where the ultimate decision has to be made , not in WikiLeaks or in Julian Assange 's living room . And that concludes round two of this debate . </s>
Here 's where we are . We are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater . They will be two minutes each . </s>
And remember how you voted before the debate because we 'll be asking you right after these closing statements to vote again , and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . On to round three , closing statements , our motion is `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets . '' And here to summarize his position against the motion , David Sanger , Chief Washington Correspondent for The New York Times . </s>
Thank you , John , and thanks to all of you . </s>
This has been a really interesting discussion that I think has revealed in our discussion of the ambiguity of the current law why a statement as broad as freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets ca n't stand simply because we can not really define terribly well what is a true state secret worth protecting . In 29 years as a reporter , I 've learned that on two things we almost always get it wrong . </s>
Whenever something has been leaked to me and I read stories later on about who the leaker was , it 's almost invariably wrong , which tells you people get the motivations wrong . </s>
But the second thing is my own estimate about what the effects are of publishing a given story is also almost always wrong . It 's very difficult as you go in and write something to know whether or not it is actually going to have a very deleterious effect . And that 's why we have ended up focusing on the narrowest questions , the obvious , the easy ones , the names of CIA agents , operations that are about to be conducted . Those are the easy questions . </s>
The hard question is what do you do to make sure that the press in the United States can force the government to debate policy on the most important questions , whether or not we invade a country and have the right evidence to go do so , whether or not we use a new weapon , whether it is a nuclear weapon in 1945 or a cyber weapon in 2011 , and think out ahead what the effects could be once we legitimize that form of war . You can not do that unless you have a bias in favor of publication , not just a bias among all of us , but a legal bias in favor of publication , one that will make sure that the republic holds together because we have made ourselves different by pressing for publication whenever there is doubt . Thank you , David Sanger . Our motion is `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets . '' </s>
And , Gabriel , I just want to ask you a very brief question . Did I mispronounce your name at the very beginning of the debate because I thought I saw -- I got a look from you as I said it . Okay , I just -- I was going to correct it for the record at this point . Okay . Let me introduce you on this one now . </s>
Laughter dies down . And here to summarize his position for the motion , Gabriel Schoenfeld , author of `` Necessary Secrets : National Security , the Media , and the Rule of Law.” I agree with David Sanger on this last point , that we should have a system that has a bias in favor of publication -- including a legal bias -- and I think that 's the system we have and the very vagueness of the Espionage Act actually has helped the press and created -- helped us create a free press , the freest press in the world . And I think there 's room for reform , but our government leaks like a sieve , and the press publishes secrets all the time . But I 'm just reminded of an episode that occurred in late 2009 , when a New York Times reporter -- one of your colleagues , David Rohde , was kidnapped by the Taliban . </s>
And Bill Keller , the executive editor of the paper , made the executive decision to withhold that information from the public . And not only did The Times not cover it , but he got all of his industry competitors and all of the Internet to agree not to reveal that David Rohde had been kidnapped . And the idea was he did n't want to do anything that would endanger Rohde 's life . </s>
And of course , that was a speculative decision , because really , publishing information about Rohde -- the fact that he had been captured -- the Taliban knew he 'd been captured . But they withheld the story . And I say to Bill Keller , “All honor to Bill Keller for that ! ” They protected the life of their guy . But when the decision involves non-journalists , it ca n't be . </s>
When it involves us . The people who ride the subway in New York . </s>
It ca n't be a voluntary decision up to Bill Keller . We -- and that 's why we have laws on the books that in the final analysis , do allow for the prosecution of the journalists when they publish not just the random things that are stamped “secret” for no good reason , but the genuine , really hardcore secrets that place our lives in danger , including some of the things that your newspaper has published -- like the SWIFT story , once again . Thank you . Gabriel Schoenfeld . </s>
Our motion is “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” And here to summarize his position against the motion , Alan Dershowitz , the Felix Frankfurter professor of law at Harvard . </s>
The proposition “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets” is far more dangerous than any of the state secrets that have allegedly been leaked during the 200 and some years of our republic . This is an extraordinarily dangerous proposition , saying that freedom of press does n't extend to state secrets . That 's where the other side has to add “genuine , ” or “real , ” or “some.” </s>
And I urge you to vote against this proposition , because if this proposition is passed , it sends an extremely dangerous message to the government -- that it continue business as usual . </s>
And the current situation is very clear . </s>
Anything that 's published relating to national security today could be subject to prosecution . Why are n't they prosecuted ? Because the government -- the very government whose secrets are leaked -- makes the discretionary decision not to prosecute . That is the wrong body to trust to make the decision , whether to prosecute . What we need is specific , focused , legislatively enacted rules that say that no one -- not a favorable press , not an unfavorable press -- can ever , under any circumstances , reveal fact A , fact B , fact C. That has to be subject to judicial review . </s>
That then has to be subject to trial by jury . The point is you do n't trust juries and prosecutors with broad , overarching criminal statutes when it comes to the First Amendment . </s>
You narrow , you limit , and then you give it to the jury . But the last institution that should be making the decision who to prosecute is the very institution that is criticized by these revelations . So I urge you -- I urge you -- do not support this proposition . This proposition is dangerous to your liberty . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Alan Dershowitz . And our motion is “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets , ” and here to summarize his position in support of this motion , Michael Chertoff , former Secretary of Homeland Security and co-founder of the Chertoff Group . </s>
Well , we support the proposition because the proof of the pudding is that we 've had hundreds of years of American history where these statues have not been , in fact , a tool to oppress or to run rampant through the First Amendment . I think that our adversaries have essentially conceded that there are a category of state secrets that ought to be protected . And what they are arguing is the existing structure is somehow not definite enough . But I just want to spend one minute talking about what the existing law is . Because in fact , I think it strikes the right balance , which is the context in which we advocate this proposition . </s>
We have the Communications Intelligence Act protecting the information about our top secret code breaking and code making communications activity , quite specific , very reasonable and very understandable . That 's what keeps us safe . We have the Intelligence Identities Act , keeping the names of intelligence agents safe as David acknowledges is appropriate and again part of the law . Even the Espionage Act , which has gotten the brunt of the fire power here , requires a finding by a jury beyond a reasonable doubt that there was intent to damage the national security of the United States , not good intentions , not accident , not negligence , but bad intent to injure the security of the United States . </s>
I would argue that 's exactly the kind of specificity that is appropriate in defining the category of state secrets that we are arguing ought to be protected under this proposition . And in fact the message that will be sent will not be one that will chill responsible reporters . </s>
It will be one that will chill the Julian Assanges who want to publish things because they want to hurt the United States and then want to claim the First Amendment to protect them against the consequences of that kind of decision . Thank you very much . Thank you , Michael Chertoff . </s>
And that concludes our closing statements . And now it 's time to find out which time has argued best . We 're going to ask you once again to go to the key pads at your seat to register your vote . And we 'll get the readout almost instantaneously . </s>
Remember , our motion is “Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets.” If you agree with this motion , if you are in favor of greater restriction on the press where publishing secrets is concerned , you vote number one . If you are against the motion , that is , you support great lenient license for the press , number two . And if you are or became undecided , press number three . And we 'll have the results in about 96 seconds from now . </s>
So before I announce the results of the vote , first of all , I want to -- I really want to express my appreciation for this team of debaters and the level of debate and seriousness that they brought to this evening . And I also want to thank all of you in the audience who took part in asking questions . They were all good questions tonight , and we really appreciate that . So a few things that I also want to talk about . </s>
This has been our 50th debate , and the conclusion of our fifth series . And this season was sponsored and underwritten significantly for us by the American Clean Skies Foundation . And we really want to give our appreciation to them . And I 'd like to do that with a round of applause . </s>
But this debate in particular was brought to you in partnership with the Film Society of Lincoln Center which is opening with the documentary “Page One : Inside The New York Times.” That 's the inaugural presentation at Lincoln center 's new Eleanor Hunan Monroe Film Center . And the film actually is -- I 've seen it . It 's a documentary . </s>
It gives very , very excellent and intimate , behind-the-scenes footage of life in The New York Times during a year that -- which the industry as a whole was trying to figure out what the industry as a whole was going to do . It also includes a feature -- it features a clip from one of our own debates and a particularly excellent moment with The New York Times media writer David Carr who sat right at that table . </s>
And I wo n't give it away . You 'll have to go see the documentary to see what he did . But it was excellent . And you can go in fact , if you take your ticket stub tonight to the film center 's box office , you can see this documentary for free starting on June 17th . Dates for our fall season are posted on the Web site , and you can take a look at our home page . </s>
Make sure to have those dates saved to your calendar . </s>
We 're looking at various topics , but they may include America post-9/11 , the decline of men , entitlements , the Arab Spring and the question of whether the world is better off without religion . </s>
Tickets will go on sale this summer . All of our debates can be heard on NPR stations across the country . And this debate in particular has been recorded for television broadcast on WNET 's channel 13 and WLIW . </s>
Also , do n't forget you can follow us on Twitter and become a fan on Facebook . And if you do so , you will get a discount on future tickets . Again , this being our 50th debate , I want to put out a special thanks to Robert Rosenkranz for kicking this whole thing off back in 2006 . </s>
And getting to 50 is amazing , and all the credit goes to him . </s>
Well , actually , there 's credit to be shared . I 'd like to -- Dana Wolfe , our executive producer who stands up and tells me what to say at every instance , every word that comes out of my mouth was actually processed by her and fed into my ear . </s>
And all -- stand up , Dana . There you go . </s>
And all of the crew who has made this season possible . So the results are in . </s>
Remember , our motion is , `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets . '' Before the debate , 39 percent were for the motion , 31 percent against and 30 percent undecided . After the debate , 46 percent were for the motion . </s>
That was up seven percent . 47 percent were against . That 's up 16 percent . </s>
And seven percent remained undecided . The team arguing against the motion , `` Freedom of the press does not extend to state secrets , '' has won this debate . </s>
Our congratulations to them . Thank you from me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S. We 'll see you next time . And I 'd like to begin the evening by introducing the chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S. , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Well , thank you very much , and it 's my pleasure to welcome all of you . </s>
My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate . So it 's time to clip America 's global wings . The U.S. government is in the worst financial shape it has ever been during our lifetimes . </s>
China is now the world 's second largest economy , and America 's largest creditor . With minimal U.S. involvement , popular movements in Egypt and Tunisia have succeeded in toppling autocratic regimes , largely through peaceful means . And where the U.S. has been involved , as in Iraq and Afghanistan , it has sometimes compromised its moral authority -- I 'm thinking of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo , abusive interrogations and civilian casualties -- and has often made us more enemies than friends . </s>
All these developments suggest that America 's hyperactive engagements around the world are financially unsustainable , morally questionable and of dubious value in the hard currency of national self-interest . On the other hand , perhaps developments in the Middle East do reflect well on America 's long-standing support for liberty and freedom . </s>
They certainly reflect well on such American innovations as Twitter and Facebook . When a tyrant like Gaddafi threatens mayhem , and the U.N. Security Council and the Arab League agree that military action is required , a miracle , by the way , their views are meaningless without U.S. power to back it up . When Iran is trying its best to achieve a nuclear weapons capability , the U.N. can fret . </s>
But only the U.S. can lead a serious effort to prevent them from succeeding . Perhaps we 're not loved . The rich and the powerful rarely are . </s>
But our unflagging efforts are vital to keep the world moving toward greater freedom and greater stability . Well , these differing views about America 's role in the world are among the most profound political fault lines that we face . The outstanding panelists we 've brought together this evening will help you decide which is the better view . And it 's now my privilege to turn the evening over to our moderator John Donvan . </s>
John , thank you . Thank you . </s>
And I would really like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz because he 's the one who makes these debates possible . True or false , it 's time to clip America 's wings , its global super power wings . Let 's have it out . </s>
This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. We 're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News , and this is another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S . Joining me on the stage , two teams of two members each who will be arguing out this motion . We have , arguing for the motion , Peter Galbraith and Lawrence Korb ; against the motion , Eliot Cohen and Elliott Abrams . </s>
And I 'll point out that throughout the week , the producer of our debate , Dana who has enjoyed describing this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate as having one team that we should call “Elliot Squared.” But -- but we wo n't . I want to remind you , this is a debate . It 's a contest . It 's a contest of ideas and logic and argumentation . </s>
And you , our audience , will be the judges of this contest . By the time the debate has ended , you will have been asked to vote twice , once before the debate and once again afterwards on our motion , “It 's time to clip America 's global wings.” And the team that has changed the most minds by the end of the debate will be declared our winner . So let 's register your first position , you and members of our audience on this debate . If you go to the keypad to the right of your seat , our motion is , “It 's time to clip America 's global wings.” </s>
If you agree with the motion , push number one . If you disagree , push number two . If you are undecided at this point , push number three . You can ignore the other keys . And if you feel that you entered a key in error , just correct it and the system will lock in your last vote . </s>
All right . It looks like everybody got it . Our motion , “It 's time to clip America 's global wings.” And on to round one . Round one , we have opening statements by each debater in turn . </s>
They are seven minutes each . </s>
And our first debater up to speak for this motion , Peter Galbraith . He 's a former U.S. diplomat . He served as a special deputy representative of the U.N. in Afghanistan . He was the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia . He is currently a Vermont state senator . </s>
His entire life has been involved in diplomacy , including a stint as a cabinet member of the transitional government of East Timor , which comes , Peter , with what sorts of perks , passport , what ? Use of the VIP lounge in Dili International Airport . But I will say it is a culmination of a career that began with a foreign relations committee ambassador to Croatia , of ever more important jobs in ever smaller places . Ladies and gentlemen , Peter Galbraith . It is time to clip America 's global wings . </s>
America 's global ambitions , particularly in the last decade , have far exceeded our capabilities . </s>
It is more than we can afford , more than a trillion dollars on two wars in Afghanistan and in Iraq . </s>
But beyond the fact that we ca n't afford it -- and my colleague , Larry Korb , will make that case , it is that we are not capable of doing it . We do not need to sit here and debate the rights and wrongs , the moral correctness or the lack of correctness of the Iraq war or the Afghanistan war . </s>
The fact is we undertook massive nation building exercises , and we did not succeed . In fact , I will argue to you that we have not only not helped the United States , we have undermined America’s national security . Now I want to be clear . </s>
Larry Korb and I are not isolationists , we are not against U.S. -- use of U.S. power in the world . When I served as the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia , I argued strongly for U.S. airstrikes against the Serbs who were attacking Sarajevo and civilians in Bosnia and Herzegovina , and when those airstrikes took place , they combined with intense diplomacy , they brought a four-year war that had claimed more than 100,000 lives to an end . It was effective . Larry Korb and I support the intervention in Libya , and it is -- for the same reason that it is working in Bosnia -- it was in Bosnia and in Libya we had limited ambitions . </s>
In Bosnia it was to end the war , in Libya to protect civilians . We had allies in Bosnia , the Europeans picked up more than two-thirds of the cost of reconstruction . They’re doing much of the heavy lifting in Libya , and we had partners on the ground . </s>
That is not the case in Iraq or in Afghanistan . In the case of Iraq , we went in not appreciating the complexities of the government , and in the end , who ended up as the victor ? Iran . </s>
For eight years , the Ayatollah Khomeini and the clerical government in Iran fought the Iran-Iraq War , at a cost of a half a million Iranian soldiers for the goal of installing , of getting rid of Saddam Hussein , and of installing in power Dawa and SCIRI , two Iranian-supported Shiite parties . They failed . In 2003 , the U.S. went in , and who is it that is in power in Iraq but the Dawa has the prime ministership , SCIRI plays a major role . Talk about unintended consequences . </s>
In Afghanistan , the United States is embarked on a counterinsurgency , I want to be clear about the operation we took to remove the Taliban , to drive out -- to try to kill and capture Al-Qaeda was correct , morally justified , endorsed by the U.N. Security Council , but that mission has now morphed into an exercise aimed at building a central government in a country that has never had a strong central government and a counterinsurgency strategy that requires -- if General Petraeus were here , its architect , he would say just what I’m going to say -- it requires a local partner for it to work . Our partner in Afghanistan is Hamid Karzai who presides over what transparency internationals described as the second-most corrupt country in the world -- number one is Somalia which doesn’t have a government at all -- is ineffective , illegitimate , having stolen his last election through massive fraud , and as a result , the strategy doesn’t work . We have invested billions in training an Afghan police force . Our idea is that by training an Afghan police force , they 'll be partners who can provide security , and why do we train the police ? Because that’s what we know how to do , but the problem in Afghanistan is the police are the visible face of a corrupt Afghan regime . </s>
The money that we’ve spent building roads so farmers can bring their products to market in Afghanistan isn’t working because , yes , the roads are there , farmers don’t bring their product to market because the police rip them off by more than the value of the market . We can train the police to be policemen , but we can not make them honest . Afghanistan is also another case of the unintended consequences of our actions . We are spending this year $ 117 billion on the Afghanistan war . </s>
To fight an enemy , the Taliban , whose budget is estimated between $ 70 million and $ 200 million , and how do the Taliban fund themselves ? From the United States . Why ? Because to supply our military in Afghanistan , we bring in supplies to the Pakistani port of Karachi , they go through Taliban-controlled territory . </s>
The contractors pay off the Taliban . And with the money used to pay for U.S. troops in Afghanistan , we ourselves are financing the Taliban . </s>
Now look at this from the point of view from the extremists . </s>
We can spend $ 70 million and get the U.S. to spend $ 117 billion . That is a pretty good investment . So , our position is simple . We need to scale back what the United States is doing in the world . Yes , to continue global engagements . </s>
Yes , to working with allies . But no to this ambitious overreaching . </s>
Yes to being smart . </s>
So , please join me in supporting the proposition that it is time to clip America’s global wings . </s>
Thank you , Peter Galbraith . And that’s our motion : `` It 's time to clip America 's global wings . '' </s>
And here to speak first against the motion , I’d like to introduce Eliot Cohen . He’s a professor of strategic studies at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University . He’s a former counselor at the Department of State , former Army Reserve officer , so he’s worked with an elite force , former faculty member at Harvard , so he’s worked with a force of elitists , and -- -- and , given the fact that you have a son who has done two tours in Iraq , none of this is theoretical for you , is it ? No , it’s not theoretical for a lot of people both here and abroad . Ladies and gentlemen , Eliot Cohen . </s>
Well , I can see one of our challenges tonight on the con team is to make it very clear that our opponents stick to what the debate’s about . The topic of the debate was not , “The Iraq War : Good Idea , Bad Idea ? ” </s>
The topic was not , “Afghanistan : Well Conducted , Poorly Conducted ? ” The topic is should we clip America’s global wings ? This is not a debate about President Bush . It’s not a debate about President Obama . </s>
It’s not a debate about Iraq . </s>
It is not a debate about Libya . It is not debate about Afghanistan . It is most certainly not a debate about whether prudence is better than recklessness . It’s not a debate about military power versus soft power . It is a debate about America’s role in the world . </s>
Our view -- my view and the view of the Elliot who can’t spell his own first name correctly -- -- is very much that of a statesman who said that the United States is an anchor of global security and an advocate for human freedom . </s>
That would be President Barack Obama . </s>
It is the mainstream view . Now , our colleagues have chosen or have agreed to a metaphor which is not one that I would have signed up to . </s>
When you clip a bird’s wings , it can only fly so high or so far . </s>
It’s not a question of where you try to get the bird to fly ; it’s what the bird can do . So the question that they will have to address is what capabilities should we give up , not what waste should we curtail ? We’re all against waste . What regions of the world no longer matter to us ? </s>
What issues will we ignore ? And what will be the consequences when we do so ? They’ve already begun by making a number of distinctions , some of which I have to say I find difficult to understand . We have limited objectives in Libya when President Obama has said that Gaddafi has got to go . We have local allies . </s>
Exactly who ? I’m not quite sure . Our opponents will and have begun making a number of arguments . </s>
They will argue -- they have argued that this is way too costly . I would just remind the audience of one statistical fact . The United States today spends something on the order of about five percent of Gross Domestic Product on defense , maybe a little bit more . During the Kennedy administration , that figure was over eight percent , during the Eisenhower administration , over 10 percent . </s>
Even with the vast expenses of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan , it is not the defense budget that is the cause of our current economic difficulties . Our record is tarnished . Well , the price of action is frequently exposing yourself in that way . There were plenty of air strikes in Bosnia , the war that Ambassador Galbraith favored , that killed civilians . </s>
That’s the price of going to war . I want to make a larger point about the world view that Elliot and I share and that , really , I think , informs our position in this . The first is a set of propositions about the United States , of which the most important is this : The United States has always been a global nation from the very beginning . We were born as part of an Atlantic community . From the outset , our trade stretched across the world , to China and to the Middle East . </s>
When the United States chose not to act as a global power with global responsibilities , we were not always the ones who paid for that . When we did -- and of course , the time that we all think of is the period after World War II -- it was not simply that the United States used its force wisely , as I believe it did . It built enduring edifices of alliances , institutions and practices that have served us and have served the world well . Fundamentally , I think the difference comes down to this : Elliott and I believe that the United States is a force for good in the world . </s>
That does n't mean that we do n't make mistakes . Of course , we will . That is , in many ways , the price of action . But we believe that the United States has been a force for good , can be a force for good and should continue to think of itself that way . </s>
We share a second fundamental world view , and that is a view about the nature of our environment . In many ways , we 've entered a world which is a dangerous and difficult place , not just thinking of issues like nuclear proliferation or global warming . </s>
By the way , it 's not clear to me that if you clip America 's global wings , why does n't that cover things like the United States taking the lead on global warming ? </s>
But beyond that , we live at a time of tremendous movements in human history . I 'll just mention two . In the last decade , hundreds of millions of Chinese have risen out of poverty . </s>
That is unambiguously a good thing . It is a good thing that countries like China do n't have to worry about famine , that Chinese fathers and mothers can have expectations of a better life for their children than they have had . But it is also true that the same economic growth that has pulled hundreds of millions of Chinese out of poverty , arms a military establishment which acts in support of a foreign policy that claims , among other things , territorial rights to the South and East China seas , to include the territory of some of our closest allies like Japan . Well , let 's take the dramatic events of recent months , the Arab spring . </s>
In many ways , this is say good thing . There 's no question about that . It is quite an extraordinary thing to watch . By the way , it 's very striking , I think , to me and to many others , that there 's not very much -- there 's no anti-Americanism in any of that . </s>
But there 's clearly potential for this to go in a number of directions . Our fundamental position is it 's in America 's interest to act where we can act , to guide and shape these events and not to be timid and not to be afraid , to exercise leadership that only the United States can lead . </s>
Thank you , Eliot Cohen . So here 's where we are . </s>
We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . Our motion is “It 's time to clip America 's global wings.” I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We have four debaters , two teams of two , fighting it out over our motion . And you 've heard two opening statements , and now we 're going to go on to the third . </s>
Lawrence Korb is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who served as assistant Secretary of Defense under the Reagan administration . And Lawrence has -- you worked for the Reagan administration , but now you are working for a think tank , you know , populated by a lot of Clinton guys . Is something not adding up in this picture or -- </s>
What 's not adding up is that the Republican Party has changed tremendously since the days of Reagan . Remember when -- in the Reagan administration , when we got into Lebanon , it did n't work , Reagan got out . He raised taxes 11 times when he recognized that supply-side economics was not working . He worked with members of Congress to reform the Social Security system that kept it in balance until this year . </s>
I think we might be getting into your set of minutes , so I 'm going to -- Well , I thought I would take advantage of it . So I 'm going to launch you with , ladies and gentlemen , Lawrence Korb . My point is that even if you think the United States should be more involved in the world , the problem is right now we 're broke . We borrow 41 cents of every dollar that the federal government spends . </s>
We borrow -- put it another way -- $ 4 billion a day . Now , if you go back and you take a look -- and I know our opponents do n't want to talk about the previous administration . Go back to the beginning of this century . </s>
The beginning of this century , the United States accounted for one-third of the world 's Gross Domestic Product . We spent one- third of what the world spends on military . Here we are today , we account for only one quarter of the world 's Gross Domestic Product , but yet we account for half of the world 's military expenditures . Five percent of the world 's population , which is us , spends half of what the rest of the world spends on defense . </s>
Now , remember at the beginning of this century , we had a budget surplus . You may remember the lockbox and all of those debates back in 2000 . That surplus was supposed to make sure that Social Security would not run out of money quicker than it has . Where did we end up at the end of this decade ? </s>
Not with a surplus of about five trillion , but with a deficit of five trillion . And then , of course , when the global economic crisis hit , we had to increase the deficit even more . Now , the question becomes , how do we get there ? Defense played a part . The war has played a part . </s>
It was n't the only part , but I think it 's important to keep in mind , in 1968 , when we had 540,000 people in Vietnam , we balanced the budget . </s>
How did we do it ? We had a surtax , a war surtax . What happened this time ? You can be for or against the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . </s>
But the fact of the matter is we went to war , and we did n't pay for it . In fact , what we did is we cut taxes . We 've never done that in our -- in our history . And what happened ? </s>
The wars cost -- the direct cost a little over a trillion dollars so far . But the indirect costs , as a lot of economists will tell us , we 'll be paying for a long time . And Joe Stiglitz up here , a Columbia economist , estimates it 'll cost three to $ 5 trillion . </s>
We compounded it during that time by increasing the defense budget , what we call the baseline budget . </s>
General McChrystal , who everybody knows , I had the privilege of working with at the Council on Foreign Relations about 10 years ago . Before he went to Afghanistan , basically he was on the joint staff and in charge of the baseline budget . And he told me , when I spoke to him the last time , he said , we did n't have to make any choices . We could have everything . The baseline budget also went up during this particular period . </s>
Again , during Vietnam and during Korea which had war costs , we looked into the baseline budget of the programs that did n't contribute to our national security . Now , you do n't think the deficit 's a problem ? Admiral Mullen , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said it 's the biggest threat to national security . And he says unless we get our economic house in order at home , we ca n't be strong abroad . </s>
Now , the defense and I agree with it . Was n't the only thing . We as individuals live beyond our means . We all assume that housing prices were going to go up 30 percent a year . </s>
And , you know , we made our decisions on that basis . States right now are having a lot of problems because when they had the pension funds for the policemen , the firemen , the teachers , they assumed they would grow eight percent a year . Well , that did n't happen , and they 're having problems . Now , the question becomes , okay , now we have these problems . Maybe we should still do a lot more in the world . </s>
And again , we 're not against involvement . But it has to be selective engagement . You ca n't deal with every situation . </s>
But we 've got a lot of challenges at home . You probably have seen all of the statistics . We 're 15th in reading , 17th in science , 25th in math . </s>
These are our children . Our infrastructure is falling apart . </s>
We 're 27th in life expectancy . You know , right now , but we are ahead in a couple of things . </s>
Obesity is one , and we 're also basically first in the amount of debt that we have and the number of people who are below the poverty -- poverty line . </s>
And what we 're doing , as a country , we 're living off our past investments . If you go back and look where we are today , these are all investments we made in the '50s and the '60s . Now , can you cut defense ? </s>
Yeah , you sure can . If you take a look at what we 're spending on defense , and you put it in constant dollars , go back and look at the Cold War average , it was 450 billion . Right now it 's 550 billion . How do I know it 's too much ? Secretary of Defense says $ 150 billion in inefficiencies . </s>
Well , we could take that money and use it to deal with some of the problems at home . And a couple of things , you know , that we could take a look at in terms of if we get back to where we are -- Secretary Gates , Secretary of Defense goes to West Point . We’re not going to send large land armies into Muslim countries again , okay ? This is a man who worked for President Reagan , worked for President Bush , is now working for President Obama . Well , if you’re not going to do that , let’s take a look at the size of the Army and the Marine Corps . </s>
This is something that you can do . We also have to recognize as a country that not all problems can be solved , nor can we solve them all . And I think , as Peter pointed out , I think Libya’s the perfect example of the way to do that . </s>
We used our unique capabilities , we got other people involved , and you know who’s a great example for this , the first President Bush . You may remember in the campaign , President Obama said , “I like President Bush , ” and everybody said , “You do ? ” and he said , “Well , the first President Bush.” The first Persian Gulf War we got over 200,000 troops from other nations , and those who couldn’t send troops , we collected money . We collected so much , we actually made a profit on the war . </s>
So it didn’t cost us anything and , in conclusion , we’ve done it before . Eisenhower got us out of Korea , wouldn’t go into Hungary and Poland , or into Vietnam . </s>
Nixon got us out of Vietnam , started arms control with the Soviet Union , recognized China , and even Reagan , when he started negotiating with the Russians , you know what Newt Gingrich called him ? Neville Chamberlain . Thank you very much . Thank you , Lawrence Korb . </s>
Our motion is `` It’s time to clip America’s global wings , '' and now to speak against the motion , Elliott Abrams , he’s a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations . He served as a deputy national security adviser in charge of Middle Eastern affairs in the George W. Bush administration . He recently commented himself on the Libya situation by saying the great mistake that the Obama White House had made in its foreign policy -- in its policy towards Gaddafi was believing that Gaddafi was a normal human being . So personality counts in the big picture ? Personality counts because in any given time there are three or four or 10 heads of government around the world who are certifiably insane . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Elliott Abrams . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Thank you . Thank you all for being here . Listening to these presentations , here I am , batting cleanup here , and I’ve only got seven minutes to correct so many mistakes . You know the joke , the old , old , old joke about the guy who is looking for his keys under the lamppost and the man says to him , “Did you drop your keys here ? ” </s>
and the guy says , “No , but the light’s better here.” Why are we cutting the military budget ? We’re cutting the military budget apparently because the military budget got us into the fiscal mess we’re in ? Wrong , it didn’t . Let’s start with the fact that we are cutting the military budget already . </s>
It isn’t as if we’re in a situation where these global wings are spreading , and the military budget is becoming a gigantic -- I mean , Defense News , February , `` U.S . Air Force Budget Shrinks . '' The Air Force , since we’re talking about wings , has been shrinking decade after decade . Armed Forces Journal , `` Tactical Inventory of the Air Force is as Small Today as at any Point Since World War II . '' Many of you no doubt read every morning the website entitled , “War is Boring.” </s>
It exists . And it 's said of the 2010 budget , the new budget includes cuts and additions . The Air Force took the biggest hits . Now , if you’re going to clip our wings , and in fact many of those wings are being clipped , you have to make some assumptions about the world . You have to assume that there will be no war on the Korean Peninsula . </s>
You have to assume there 'll be no war between Israel and Iran . You have to assume absolute stability in Asia despite the rise of China . You have to assume no 9/11 attack on the United States again , that we wish to respond to . </s>
Are you absolutely confident about all of that , confident enough to reduce American power , that in one , or two , or five , or 10 years we may need ? You know , the person who summed this up best was actually President Obama in his Nobel speech . “The world must remember that it was not simply international institutions , not just treaties and declarations that brought stability to a post- World War II world . Whatever mistakes we’ve made , the plain fact is this : the United States of America has under -- has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens , and the strength of our arms . The position the other side is taking is a very radical position , I mean , well to the left of President Obama . </s>
Now , we have been spreading our wings for some decades as Eliot mentioned . The world is a better place for it . Peter mentioned some of the places where it is a better place . Bosnia was , I think , the example he used . </s>
Take a look at Asia today . It’s an interesting thing . You don’t hear the South Koreans , the Taiwanese , the Vietnamese , the Singaporeans , the Indians saying , “Hey , it’s time to clip your global wings , ” because they’re afraid of China . </s>
And they want our help in balancing a rising China . Look at Vietnam . Some of you will remember the Cam Ranh Bay Naval Base that we had during the Vietnam War . Now -- now , the government of Vietnam has asked us to come back . Their defense minister was quoted as saying , “This port should be a fuel stop for aircraft carriers.” </s>
Well , they don’t have any aircraft carriers . He means our aircraft carriers , that they weren’t stopping there to counterbalance China . The idea that we need to diminish the size of our military -- let me quote from a famous American . Getting the Democratic nomination in 2004 , John Kerry said , “I will never give any nation or institution a veto over our national security , and I will build a stronger military . We will add 40,000 active duty troops.” </s>
That’s John Kerry . These guys are taking a position well to the extreme on these questions . Now the finances . “We have to cut the military budget because we’re broke.” Bill Clinton’s budget director , Alice Rivlin , wrote last week -- last month , excuse me -- quote , “Defense spending is not a cause of the growing projected deficits . </s>
It’s the entitlement programs that drive future spending up faster than GDP can grow.” </s>
Clinton budget director . The deputy secretary of the Treasury for Bill Clinton , Roger Altman , “Imperial overstretch is not the real issue here . It is fiscal , economic , and political failures at home that are threatening the ability of the United States to exert global influence.” The defense budget has been falling as a percentage of GDP for decades . </s>
It’s falling under four percent now . It is scheduled in the next five years to go under three percent of GDP . </s>
So what’s the argument they’re making ? Really , it’s ideological . American power is bad . Well , that’s not exactly the argument . Peter tells us American power in Bosnia was good . </s>
So I guess what it comes down to is this : When is American power bad and when is American power good ? Just ask them . And they’ll tell you where we need to intervene and where we don’t . Doesn’t work . If the United States is going to reduce our global wings , if we’re going to reduce our power , we’re going to put ourselves in a situation where we can not do what we need to do around the globe . </s>
Now , who benefits from this ? Who benefits ? Who benefits if there are more Srebrenicas and Darfurs and Rwandas ? The answer is people like Gaddafi and Milosevic and Bashar al-Assad and Saddam Hussein . They benefit . </s>
We do not and the people who depend on us and our power for their safety in a very dangerous world , 300 million Americans and hundreds of millions more around the globe . We’ll lose . Do not buy this picture of America that doesn’t exist , with a people and a military and a president just lusting for intervention everywhere , and a military budget that must be decimated if we are to be safe . On the contrary , if we are to be safe , and if the world is to be safe , those global wings need to be strong . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Elliott Abrams . That concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared debate where our motion is `` It 's time to clip America 's global wings . '' Now we want to have you keep in mind how you voted again at the beginning of the evening because at the end of the arguments , we’re going to have you vote again . And the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . </s>
Now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly and they also answer questions from the audience and from me . We have two teams of two here at New York University’s Skirball Center for the Performing Arts . We have Peter Galbraith and Lawrence Korb who are arguing for the motion , `` It 's time to clip America 's global wings . '' They’ve been making the argument that America is drastically overreaching . </s>
It’s essentially a pragmatic argument , that we can not afford to overreach much longer . Their opponents , Eliot Cohen and Elliot Abrams , are making somewhat more of a moral argument . </s>
They 're saying that the U.S. has always been a global power . And when it has chosen not to be so , somebody usually ends up paying in the end . </s>
I want to put to the team that 's arguing for the motion . Now , your opponents are essentially saying , if we can be involved globally , if we can , we should . Your argument is more , we ca n't , so we should n't . It 's about -- it 's about , you 're putting it in terms of a price tag , or that 's certainly how it 's sounding to me . </s>
And if I 'm wrong , I 'd like you to correct it . But your opponents are also saying that you just basically find beyond that the use of U.S. power somehow distasteful . Peter Galbraith . Well , I 'm looking for the elephant here , the elephant in the room , because we just had a discussion from the opponents of this motion that did n't discuss Iraq and Afghanistan which are the two major projections of American power , the two major expenditures in this millennium . </s>
Okay , this century , if you do n't want to be too ambitious . </s>
The problem with them is that they have ended up weakening the United States . Certainly the Iraq war caused America 's prestige , which was sky high after Bosnia and Kosovo to collapse . </s>
Turkey , we went from an 80 percent approval rating to a six percent approval rating in the second largest country in NATO . </s>
We have ended up empowering Iran . You will recall President Bush describing an axis of evil , of Tehran and Baghdad . They were bitter enemies -- But , Peter , are you arguing the principle is the issue or the execution is the issue ? It is the execution . </s>
It is that we try to do things that we ca n't do . </s>
We tried to -- But your opponents are making an argument about principle . Well -- look , they are the George Bush administration , what they represent is probably the most ambitious idealistic American administration . But they did n't succeed . Okay . </s>
Let me have -- It ca n't work . -- one of the Elliotts come in . Eliot Cohen . I think if you -- by the way , if you notice , the only president we were quoting was Barack Obama . </s>
Well , I understand why you would n't want to quote Bush . </s>
Well , right . That 's understandable . With whom we agree on basic principles . </s>
And the fact is we did n't talk about Iraq . That was not the topic that was given . And in fact , I think you can think that the Iraq war was a stupid idea , as Barack Obama does , and still think that this is a bad idea . </s>
Yeah , but how bad an idea could it have been ? Eliot Cohen . You supported it , sir , in 2003 . </s>
So you do n't -- You 're pointing to Lawrence Korb . No . I 'm pointing at Peter Galbraith . </s>
Peter Galbraith . But let me say something here . Let me say something here . What 's the argument ? </s>
What we 're talking about here is -- and you mention my Republican thing -- the way the Republicans always look at cost benefits . You want to quote someone ? </s>
Let me quote one of your colleagues , Fukiyama , who wrote the book , “The End of History” and talked about -- </s>
He 's not a Republican , by the way . He was one of the -- And neither am I , actually , for the record . -- supporters of the war . But you know , Frank said -- and he supported the war , he said , if you had told the American people in 2003 , we 're going to go to war in Iraq , and we 're going to have almost 5,000 Americans die , 30 to 40,000 wounded , hundreds of thousands of Iraqis die , spend over a trillion dollars so Iraq could have an election , you would have been laughed out of the ballpark . </s>
You 've got to have select -- I remember growing up in New York City at the time of the Polish and Hungarian revolutions . </s>
And you had a lot of people from Eastern Europe here . And basically , they wanted the United States to do something . How can you stand by ? </s>
I remember pictures of Cardinal Mindszenty on the head of The Daily News , `` We 've got to do -- '' no . </s>
Eisenhower made a calculation . When they wanted them to bail out the French at Dien Bien Phu . General Ridgway came to them and said , “Hey , here 's the cost.” He said , “Forget it . </s>
Bedell Smith , go to” -- All right . Let me go to the other side . What you 're hearing is an argument that lots of time the U.S. has chosen not to get involved because -- </s>
Oh , sure . -- of the cost . </s>
Eliot Cohen -- Elliott Abrams . One of the causes in the world that I do care about a lot is Tibet . I 'm not urging us to go to war with China over Tibet . We can’t do it . It would be foolish . </s>
But Peter , in 2003 , supported the war for the right reasons , I mean morally , the right reasons . What he said was he thought there would be just massacres in Kurdistan , and there would be massacres of the Shia , and indeed , there had already been . Those are , I think , morally compelling arguments for why we did what we did . And we avoided those massacres . And in fact , the Kurds are doing very well now , and there is a Shia majority government , democratic government in Iraq . </s>
I also do n't accept the view that the Iraq war has been lost . It was n't lost in 2007 , was n't when you said it was . Was n't lost in 2008 or '9 . </s>
It is n't lost now . It may be too soon to say what the final outcome in Iraq is going to be , but it certainly is n't lost . But I just do n't understand how you can say , no , it was -- it would have been right to just let the Kurds and the Shia be slaughtered by Saddam Hussein . And , by the way -- </s>
Well , let me let Peter Galbraith reply directly to that because you worked with the Kurds quite a bit . What about that ? Well , there 's no doubt that the people -- the peoples of Iraq -- because there is n't such a thing as an Iraqi nation . </s>
But that the peoples of Iraq , 80 percent of whom are either Kurds or Shiites have emerged much better off . And possibly , if we had gone in , gotten rid of Saddam Hussein and gotten out , if we had n't undertaken the Bremer multibillion dollar occupation where we had people -- sent young people in there with no experience to run the Iraqi budget , to draw up the traffic plans for Baghdad , that 's how ambitious we were . We were doing American traffic plans for Baghdad . You know , but we 'd gotten rid of Saddam , gotten out , it might have been a rather different history . But you can not say that this was worth nearly a trillion dollars , especially when it meant that Iran , which had been intimidated in 2003 -- its nuclear program was on hold -- had become emboldened in part because its best friends were now running Iraq . </s>
And North Korea took advantage of this to get a free pass . I think all of us would agree that proliferation -- Was it worth a trillion dollars ? </s>
Eliot Cohen , can you speak to , was it worth a trillion dollars ? So let me get this straight . If we invade Iraq , we depose Saddam Hussein and leave , that 's an America whose global wings have been clipped , which is a good thing . No , we shouldn’t -- He was contained . </s>
That just -- that just makes -- That just makes no sense . Wait , wait . Let Eliot finish . </s>
We 'll come back to your point , by the way . </s>
Since when I was in government , I was looking at the intelligence on the Iranian parliament . </s>
It is very curious how they stopped their war head design program immediately after a major geopolitical event that occurred to their West . And that may have had a passing connection with it . Lawrence Korb . And they started it back when they saw how incompetent we were , the kind of investment we were making -- </s>
We -- we 're losing confidence is better than incompetence . Lawrence Korb . That 's not the topic being debated . </s>
I think -- and we get back -- look , there 's a lot of evil in the world , and you have to decide whether the potential benefits are worth the costs that you have to pay . </s>
And that 's why if you had told the American people that in the beginning , regardless of the outcome , you never would have gotten support . </s>
If you had asked people to raise taxes and to have a draft , which we should have done because of the fact that we overworked a lot of these young people , sent them back -- when I was in government , we got the voluntary military going . We made a compact with the young people . For every year you spend in the combat zone , you get at least two years at home . It did n't work . Okay , you got 500,000 people , according to RAND , who have mental problems because of being over-deployed . </s>
If you took Iraq and Afghanistan out of this equation , Peter Galbraith , where do you disagree with the other side ? Well , I 'm in favor of a more limited role where we have allies intervening where -- if we are to intervene , to intervene where we have allies , generally consistent with international law , where there are partners on the ground . I think there are circumstances -- </s>
And you think your opponents are for what ? </s>
Libya is another . But you think your opponent 's position is what then ? Well , they do n't want to talk about Afghanistan and Iraq and this very expansive nation- building enterprise in which both of them were -- administration in which both of them were very intimately involved . </s>
Now , if their position is that they are also in favor -- you know that they will never do that kind of thing again , and that they 'll clip America 's wings because we 're not going to try -- and we 'll get out of Afghanistan or reduce our forces to something that 's commensurate with an achievable mission , then maybe we 're on the same wavelength . Are they in favor of the hundred thousand dollar mission -- . A hundred thousand dollar mission in Afghanistan ? </s>
But , Peter , let Elliott Abrams come in . </s>
Here 's the problem with that . First of all , you guys disagree about Iraq because Peter correctly , in my view said , you know , if we had been able to go in , depose Saddam Hussein , save the Kurds and the Shia and then , in your view , get out , that would have been worth doing . Now , how in hell do you go into Iraq and depose Saddam Hussein in three weeks with your clipped wings ? You ca n't do it . You need to maintain the military that Larry doesn’t want us to maintain in order to achieve exactly that goal . </s>
Wait , wait . Wait a second . Larry Korb -- We went in with -- </s>
Okay , Larry Korb . -- Bill Clinton 's military , the one you said wasn’t big enough . It wasn’t Bush 's military that went in . It was John Kerry , I 'm sorry . And we were spending on defense , about half on the baseline of what we’re spending now . </s>
And we marched through Baghdad in three weeks . Could I make a request in this debate that this not become Republican-Democrat , and that , that old -- that old shape -- Okay ? Not to say that the wars we’re talking about are not material , but I don’t want to go down that old ground . </s>
I think we’re talking about something fairly important here and I think we are talking about principles . And it does sound to me as though these two sides agree on the broad principle that the U.S. has a role in the world , wants to try to influence events . </s>
Both sides are agreeing on that , and I’m beginning to wonder where the essential disagreement really is unless you are saying it just costs too much on this side and on your side I’m not sure what your comeback is to that . It doesn’t cost too much . The fact is that -- Elliott Abrams . </s>
-- the percentage of GDP that we are spending on defense continues to decline . What is going up in this country , and I think everybody here knows it , is entitlement spending , and that is what has tied the Congress in knots , because there are very few politicians in either party bold enough to deal with entitlement spending . </s>
We are not broke because of the military budget . </s>
Now wait a second , wait a second . Let’s go back and take a look . You look at the discretionary budget , the budget that doesn’t deal with entitlements , things that people have earned , like military retirement , these thing -- if you look at discretion -- defense is half of the discretionary budget . And right now the politicians of Washington have frozen nondefense discretionary . That’s not going to help , I agree we need to take a look at the other things . </s>
I mentioned President Reagan in 1983 worked on it . But the fact of the matter is you don’t just ignore half of the discretionary budget , particularly if you cut it . And you mentioned Alice Rivlin . Did you read the report of the Domenici-Rivlin Commission ? </s>
No . </s>
She said cut $ 100 billion in defense by 2015 . All right , I want to go to the audience for some questions in a moment . I’d like you to prepare your questions , again , terse questions that have a question mark at the end , and to the point of the debate , and microphones will circulate and when you’re chosen and a microphone comes to you , please stand up and hold it about a fist distance away from your mouth so that the radio audience will be able to hear you clearly . But I want to take one more shot at this issue of whether we’re really talking about execution and price tag only , if in a fantasy world , and it may be therefore irrelevant , if we had unlimited resources , would that mean to the side that’s arguing for clipping America’s wings , carrying your argument out , that our limitation is financial only if we didn’t have that limitation , would you be for doing all kinds of zany stuff out there ? </s>
Well , Afghanistan is the perfect case in point , and this is probably an issue in which we have a very concrete ongoing difference . </s>
In Afghanistan we have 100,000 troops , $ 117 billion committed to a strategy which can not work because it -- the essential element for success which is an Afghan partner does not exist . So we don’t need to -- and yet I suspect they would continue this . Well , why don’t we put it to them ? Yeah good question . I mean , how do you make a counterinsurgency work when you don’t have a partner ? </s>
Eliot Cohen . First I would n't say that we don’t have a partner , I mean we have a weak partner . If we had a strong partner there wouldn’t be an insurgency because these things are basically about governance . And do I think we’re going to be there for a long time ? Yes . </s>
Do I think we had any choice about going in there ? No . Remember , this was the good war . This is the war that everybody I dare say including both of you were in favor of in 2001 . </s>
And it is the problem that Elliot has pointed out which is correct , once you go in there -- so what exactly are you going to do , are you just going to sort of leave the thing in chaos and not do anything ? Now we can argue back and forth about did we do the smart thing , did we do the stupid thing , should we have backed somebody other than Karzai , should we have organized that place differently , should we have had different ambassadors ? </s>
That’s not the point . The point is this proposition about clipping America’s global wings . By the way , I can not imagine Ronald Reagan ever signing up for that sort of proposition . </s>
And as long as I have the floor , one other -- For about 10 seconds , -- -- tell me how cutting the defense budget by $ 100 billion makes all the fat people out there lose weight -- -- increases life expectancy and gets the kids away from Nintendo and into the calculus books . </s>
I don’t get it . Now , let me come back -- Lawrence Korb . Let me make a point here , because I agree . </s>
We went into Afghanistan . The problem was and this is what I’m talking about , clipping your wings , selective engagement . You didn’t finish the job in Afghanistan . You diverted your attention to Iraq . And you allowed Afghanistan to deteriorate . </s>
I agree , Afghanistan was the right war . And , in fact , I commended President Bush because he told -- in the beginning , he said to the Taliban , “You turn over al-Qaeda , we’ll leave you alone.” They didn’t , so we went in . </s>
We had to . The problem was , within months , we started diverting our attention to Iraq , which was not a critical issue , had nothing to do with 9/11 . Back when Eisenhower was president , we were spending 10 percent of the GDP on defense , we didn’t go into Vietnam . One more thing before we go to audience questions . </s>
Eliot Cohen , you said earlier that you feel your opponents basically think that power is bad , but I’m not hearing that from them at all . I’m sorry , Elliot Abrams -- was it Elliot Abrams that made that point about -- </s>
Yes . We’re practically interchangeable . Just for the spelling , but other than that -- So , I’m not hearing that . If you find that the defense budget is not killing our economy , and I think it’s ridiculous to urge that it is , then why are we doing this wing-clipping stuff ? </s>
What is it we’re trying to stop ? The only word I’ve heard is nation-building . Now , you know , we did nation building in Germany after World War II . We did it Japan after World War II . We’re trying to do it in a number of other places . </s>
Generally , people are ending up a lot better off after we try to do the nation-building . So I think ask myself , well , if we’re trying to build democracy -- this is Colin Powell’s old “you break it , you bought it , ” the Pottery Barn rule -- we go into the country and we say , “No , we’re not going to depose the head of government and leave it a shambles . We’re going to try to help them build a decent country here and build a democracy.” That’s a good thing to do , and I must say I don’t understand the argument except financial for saying -- But I’m still not hearing you respond to your earlier statements that this team actually is uncomfortable exerting American power . </s>
That’s what I -- it sounded like you’re saying it , and yet I don’t think that that’s any -- If they are comfortable asserting American power , then I think their argument simply falls apart or becomes just a sort of financial argument , that we would love to run the world , but , you know , we’re broke this year . No , no , no , no . We’re not saying that . We’re saying trying to run the world does cost you a lot of money that you don’t have to spend . </s>
And , even if -- But you’re good with running the world . </s>
If you had all the money , you got to look at selective engagement . You can not save the world , okay ? There are a lot of problems in the world that you can’t deal with that you have to live with . </s>
You ask me what’s the most dangerous place in the world ? </s>
Pakistan . All right ? You want to send troops into Pakistan ? Okay ? </s>
You’re not going to do that . And , again , you should have thought about that before you went into , you know , you went into Iraq and took your eye off the ball in Afghanistan . All right . </s>
Let me go to some questions . And there’s a gentleman -- I’m looking right -- yes , and you gestured correctly . If you would stand , sir , and give the camera four seconds to find you , and it has . And , again , if anyone is asking questions is a member of the media , we’d appreciate you identifying yourself . </s>
Just do us a favor . </s>
But please , go ahead . Yes , I have a question for Mr. Abrams . Doesn’t the law of unintended consequences rear its head , for example , in Somalia we went in to restore order , and we wound up with Black Hawk Down and the troops being dragged through the street . We funded the mujahedeen in Afghanistan . That turned out to be al-Qaeda . </s>
You mentioned Rwanda . You had two African tribes hacking each other up with machetes . Do you really want to send American troops into these places when , frequently , it turns -- it backfires to our detriment ? Do you think those were overreaches of power ? Well , obviously , you have -- basically , you judge a situation by what happened , by the consequences , not by what was intended . </s>
But , obviously , in those situations -- By the outcome . </s>
We downed it to our detriment . All right . </s>
Elliot Abrams . The question of unintended consequences is a very important question . </s>
And you can cite a number of examples where we -- for over 50 years , where we did something wrong or foolishly or incompetently . But take Rwanda , your example . There are hundreds of thousands of dead people in Rwanda because we did nothing . And Bill Clinton has said it is the greatest regret , he has said , about his presidency , that he did nothing to stop it . Now , the repertoire is large and doesn’t only include sending in the Marines . </s>
We have no marines in Libya , but we are intervening in a way that is meant to do some good , and with which I agree . So , yeah , you’ve got to -- I guess the argument is , yes , you need to be very careful whenever you commit American troops . You need to be very careful even if you’re not committing American troops . You’re committing American prestige and money . But I don’t think that can be an argument for inaction . </s>
It can’t be an argument for saying , “We don’t really know what’s going to happen tomorrow in Srebrenica . Let’s not go in . </s>
We do n't really know if Saddam Hussein will massacre the Kurds . Let 's leave it alone . It takes you too far.” Peter Galbraith , you want to follow on that as an opponent ? Well , I think the question of the mujahedeen in Afghanistan 's a very good one because we simply allowed the Pakistani dictator , Zia-ul-Haq under the Reagan administration , to decide who to fund . </s>
And he funded the most extreme elements . And we are now living with the consequences of that . </s>
I want to come to the question of , you know , should web in the business of nation building , building democracies ? Yes . We had an interest in removing the Taliban . We had an interest in trying to kill or capture al-Qaeda . </s>
What interest did we have in trying to build a strong central government in Afghanistan , a place that has never had one and will not have one in the lifetime of anybody sitting in this room , even young people ? </s>
Okay . </s>
I -- What interest did we have in -- Peter , I 'm going to interrupt because that was a self-asked question , and I 'm -- I 'm wanting to really hear from the audience in this . But that does n't mean you ca n't get to that in your closing remarks . </s>
Let me just go to the far side here . And there 's -- yeah . </s>
You have a colorful sleeve . You 're welcome . And if you could stand up , they 'll find you . Could you stand ? </s>
Thanks . Yeah , I 'd just like to ask , you 're talking about cutting -- to Mr. Abrams -- about cutting entitlements as one way to deal with America 's deficit problem . But not a single one of the panelists tonight has talked about tax extensions or tax breaks to the super wealthy or to -- All right . Lovely question . </s>
And that is a huge hole in this argument . And stay tuned for a future debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. on that topic . Thank you . </s>
I really want to stay on the power clipping issue . -- taxes to support the war . Sir , there 's a -- a little farther back , three back . If you could stand , thanks . </s>
President Eisenhower spoke of the military industrial complex . And as long as we have so many people in the military and government and in business interested in creating such a great military industrial complex , wo n't we continue to be in these kinds of wars and have these kinds of -- </s>
But how would you relate that , sir , to our motion about clipping -- Well , I think part of the reason we 're not clipping America 's global wings is enough people are interested in keeping the military . And once you -- you have a large military , somebody 's going to use it . All right . I 'm going to let that stand as a comment because it 's not quite to our point . </s>
Ma'am in the blue -- teal , the teal . Is that teal ? Did I get that right ? Huge number of -- I 'd like to commend the lady over there for having questioned the attack on entitlements . I believe Mr. Abrams spoke about the Marshall Plan having been a very constructive thing . </s>
What about a Marshall Plan for the American people who are now suffering -- Okay . I 'm going to let that stand as a comment as well . It 's clear that we know what your view is . Folks , really -- I really want you to try to bring it in , just to land these things perfectly . </s>
Sir , blue Blazer , yeah . </s>
Yeah , hi . I think to the point , I do n't know if -- </s>
Thank you . </s>
Yeah , I do n't know if the story is true , but I 've heard that Benjamin Franklin apparently wanted the turkey to be our national bird . But we chose instead the eagle , a bird with strong wings . And I think the argument can be made that America without strong wings is simply not America . You think it 's an identity issue literally ? </s>
I think it has to do with who we are and why we 're here . All right . Do you feel that this -- The question is , I think the argument is being made strongly that perhaps we should be -- we should not be stupid in how we use our strength and our wealth and our forces . We should be smarter about how we do it . </s>
But can you really argue that America should clip its wings as opposed to simply being smarter and more efficient about how we use -- Lawrence Korb . And that 's such a great question . And do n't miss it , okay ? Since you used a metaphor here , there 's a great book written by a professor here at this wonderful university , Peter Beinart . </s>
It 's called “The Icarus Syndrome.” And he said throughout our history , we get carried away thinking that because of who we are we can solve all the world 's problems . And he goes back , and he talks about Vietnam where we went in , we thought the domino theory and all of that type of thing , found out we even -- when our economy was much better , we still could not achieve the objective that we wanted . </s>
And that 's what -- you used the term , you 've got to be smart about it , there are certain things you 've got to do , other things you realize that they 're beyond your capacity . And I think that 's the key thing . Now , at this particular time , we talk about the fact that defense has nothing to do with it . </s>
No . We added $ 2 trillion to the deficit in the last decade because of actions that happened from 2001 to 2008 , okay ? If we had those $ 2 trillion , the other problems would not be as bad . And so that 's the point I 'm making . </s>
All right . Let 's hear from your opponents on this topic , Eliot Cohen . </s>
On the -- on the eagle , the national seal has the eagle clutching arrows and olive branches . And originally , the eagle pointed at the arrows . And Harry Truman welcomed Winston Churchill to the White House . And he very proudly pointed to him that he 'd redesigned the seal so that the eagle 's head looked at the olive branches . And Churchill said -- wise thing . </s>
He said , `` You know , my view is the eagle 's head should be mounted on a swivel . '' </s>
So it can look either at the olive branch or at the arrows as is necessary . </s>
He did n't say anything about clipping the damn bird 's wings . Thank you , sir , for the question . </s>
With the program in your hand , arise , and a microphone will find its way to you . Question . </s>
The side in favor of the resolution has talked about a lot of interventions in retrospect and the cost and how we have allies that are n't accountable or are corrupt . And I want to know from both sides what criteria you think the American public ought to use right now to determine which interventions are acceptable , which ones are not ? What are the rules , in other words ? Can you -- I 'd like to ask you -- I 'd like to ask you each to answer this excellent question in -- no , seriously , but in a bullet format . I 'd just like to hear your list from each side , what it takes . </s>
And I know that , Peter , you actually touched on some of it earlier . But either of you can take it and tell us the four or five most important elements . I was -- I 'm glad you asked the question because I was just writing down some bullet points on exactly this . </s>
First , I think when we intervene , it 's very important that we operate with the vision of the people on whose behalf we are intervening , not ours . I think that 's my main critique of what we 've done in Iraq and Afghanistan . Why did we want to disassemble Kurdistan and Iraq ? </s>
It worked . </s>
Why build a central government ? But that would , to me , be the most important point . </s>
Second -- And what else ? </s>
Defer to the judgment of others , including in the international community , the U.N. , our allies . Do n't go it alone . </s>
And finally , I would take a count of the costs and the benefits . When we intervened in Bosnia , it was a -- yes , it was by air , but it was for a short period of time , relatively inexpensive incidentally , and all our interventions in both Bosnia , Kosovo , not a single American or NATO soldier died in hostile combat -- Okay . Let me go to the other -- And finally -- finally , as a Vermonter , I have to say , turkeys have very strong wings . </s>
We have lots of wild turkeys . Now to this side . Yeah . I -- Eliot Cohen , question . </s>
First thing I think when you 're talking about the use of force , the question is always , are we going to avoid something worse . And I think that it 's important to be very serious about this . Using force is a terrible thing . You 're going to kill innocent civilians . You 're going to make mistakes . </s>
You 'll probably get some of your own people killed . And those are real people . Are you going to avoid something worse ? That 's really the fundamental reason why we do go to war , and we should go to war . Is this doable as far as we can -- as far as we can guess ? </s>
And it is a guess . Is it in our self-interest ? And is it in our broader interest as Americans ? From the very founding of this country , we 're caught between the tension between the same kind of interest that other countries have and our ideals . That 's what it is to be an American . </s>
And it 's incumbent upon our leaders to wrestle with that and to lay it out for us . But above all , at the end of it , do n't think that any of us can come up with a set of rules which we can , you know , give you , and that 's a sort of a decision making guide that any president can take with him or her to make a decision . No , but the question did reveal a great deal with how the two sides think . </s>
And I thank you for it . And I want to take it one step further . I want you to respond to the list that you heard over there , and do you have any disagreement with it ? </s>
Or would you add his list to your list ? I would -- I would critical question here . And I think Elliott is right in saying when we intervene militarily , the chances are that some innocent people and some American servicemen and women will be killed . </s>
So the question is to what end ? And if the answer is , I 'm not sure , you do n't do it . If the answer is , to save a million lives , or 500,000 lives , to stop Darfur , to stop Srebrenica , then the balance may shift . Okay , and , Lawrence , can you respond to what you heard ? Well , I’m going to very quickly -- </s>
Lawrence , can you respond to their list ? </s>
Okay . Thanks . I have very quick . Multilateral if you can , unilateral only if you must . </s>
I think that 's what you have to do , and you have to basically ask yourself that question and the same thing in terms of what you ca n't know exactly ahead of time but you can do a pretty good idea of the cost and the benefits and recognize that you do n't just use the military to solve all these problems . </s>
Okay , so that 's your list . What 's your response to what you heard from the other side ? Would you -- do you agree with what they -- Well , my response to them is basically if you take a look at a lot of the operations we do , they haven’t done that ahead of time in terms of the cost and the benefits . </s>
Guilty ? You have to take the point that Eliot made at the end , you can’t predict the future or at least you can’t predict it perfectly . You do the best you can , you use the best intel you can , you try to make the best guess as to what the costs will be and what the benefits will be , and sometimes you get it on the dime , and sometimes you’re way off . According to Colin Powell -- Look , I -- </s>
-- Bush never did that before he went into Iraq . Eliot Cohen . Never was . Eliot Cohen . I’ve sat in NSC meetings and I know first that presidents take these issues very , very seriously , particularly when they 're committing American lives . </s>
That was true of George W. Bush , was true of Barack Obama , it was true of Bill Clinton . </s>
I also know that none of these decisions are easy . They don’t get to that level if they were easy , and so there are always going to be -- there’s going to be an element of guesswork , and then an element of risk . The other thing , by the way , is we have really focused , because this is the preoccupation of the other team , on these high end interventions . There are other kinds of things . Let’s talk about the Sudan peace process , let’s talk about what’s been really quite a tremendous success in Columbia which has been an exercise of American power in many dimensions including the nonmilitary , this is not a debate about American military power , it’s America’s global wings , and those wings include a lot of nonmilitary elements which have been tremendously successful . </s>
All right , we’re going to take a quick break . Our motion is , “It’s time to clip America’s global wings.” We’re going to take a quick break , and we’ll be right back with more questions from the audience . So I’m going to ask you in a second to help assist coming back from the break in the radio broadcast and television broadcast to applaud , and once you do and as the applause dies away , I’ll reintroduce the broadcast and we’ll go back to your questions . </s>
So can I have a round of applause , please ? Our motion is , `` It’s time to clip America’s global wings . '' This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I’m John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We have two debaters , two teams of two , debating this motion , `` It’s time to clip America’s global wings . '' We are taking questions from the audience . The man in the blue shirt , you’ve been very patient . Oh , I’m sorry . </s>
You know , everybody in the audience could’ve stood up at that point . I’m sorry . I grew up as a child in Africa surrounded on one side by Cubans and on another side by Russians , who were spreading their wings , and the one safe thing we always felt as children was , we had the United States , and we were enfolded within its wings . </s>
What would you feel if we clipped the wings with Russia now , with -- I beg your pardon -- China now spreading its wings , and you now clip your wings , how secure would everybody feel ? Do you -- and I want to clarify -- do you feel that that’s the argument that this side , arguing for clipping wings , is making ? </s>
Yeah , I feel -- </s>
You do , that they’re putting you at risk ? </s>
I feel they’re putting us at risk . All right , I want to take that question to the side that’s arguing for clipping America’s global wings . </s>
Let me go -- Lawrence Korb . I think you raise a great point . </s>
China is gaining because we’re bogged down in Afghanistan . They would love us to be there forever , keep spending all of this money and help their a foreign policy objectives . They’re a free rider in the Middle East . We’re doing -- what’s China doing ? </s>
Sitting back and taking advantage of it . </s>
So I think our point is that , you know , when you say clip your wings , you’ve got to work with the rest of the community . We can’t have too many free riders . It’s very interesting when the deficit came up in Britain and France , they cut their defense spending . </s>
They cut it . And then , of course , who has to pick up the thing ? We do . </s>
Well , I’m glad that President Obama said , “Wait a second . You have more interest in Libya than we do.” And I’m glad that the international community did it . So , I think you’re going to look at China . They’re doing great because they’re a free rider . </s>
Sir , can you -- I just want to ask you about your response to their response , but briefly . I feel that China has got such great ambitions and they’re now growing their military , which was on TV just the other day , that to send the message that America’s going to start clipping its wings is going encourage them to go into places they wouldn’t normally even think of going to . All right . Let me come to the other side . </s>
Eliot Cohen . A couple of months ago , I had 10 days in Japan before the awful events of the tsunami and the reactor incident . And the main thing we were talking about , particularly with the defense and foreign policy people are these little islands called the Senkakus , which have been Japanese territory for a very , very long time . The Chinese have a claim . And , of course , it’s not so much that they care about the islands . </s>
They care about the territorial waters and so forth . </s>
And the Japanese are under a lot of pressure , and they are actually quite fearful about the possibility of a Chinese grab for those islands . By the way , the Chinese really do say , “That water is ours.” Japanese do not – then most certainly do not want to see America’s global wings clipped . And I assure you that today they want it even less , when 18,000 American servicemen and women , 22 warships of the United States Navy are helping that country deal with the worst catastrophe that it’s faced since World War II . </s>
And a good thing . Peter Galbraith , do you want to respond to that ? Well , the problem is that national security resources -- money , troops -- are not unlimited . And so you have to make choices . And if you make choices to deploy them in Afghanistan in pursuit of a strategy that , on the face of it , isn’t working , those resources are not available to deal with other threats or other national security issues , be it China , be it North Korea , be it Iran . </s>
And so , when we talk about clipping America’s wings , what we’re really talking about is not making -- removing American from the world stage . We’re talking about moving away from very ambitious exercises in nation building -- Afghanistan , Iraq are two cases in point -- to a selective use of power so that we can -- a selective use of these scarce resources so that we can focus on the real challenges . That’s all . </s>
You know , the gentleman with the red sweater , you wanted to ask a question because you had a blue shirt . I just felt I got you up there , I sat you down -- </s>
But I hope it’s a good question . </s>
If we refuse to clip our wings in any way , shape , or form , if we insist on American adventurism , then why don’t we simply tax everybody on a pay-as-you-go basis and say , “These are the choices that you’ve made . You must pay for it at the end of every year.” I’m going to let -- I’m going to let that stand as an interesting comment , which it is , but I don’t think it actually moves our discussion . </s>
Sir , yep , yep , you just touched it -- could you stand up please ? Hi , thank you . Thank you all for being here . I just thought to myself , geez , the last 50 years we’ve borrowed a lot of money to kill people in wars . </s>
And here we are , 2011 , and we’re borrowing money to keep our own people alive here in the U.S. It’s crazy . In any case , I believe that we can clip our wings in defense , but we can expand our wings in technology and alternative energy . Would any of you be opening to maybe clipping wings in defense or , if you’re not open to it , maybe the bond market may be open to it , but let’s expand our wings with new entities , new enterprise , and move away from this consistent defense increase year over year . Thank you so much . Thank you . </s>
Peter Galbraith . </s>
I think you make actually quite an important point , which is that we’ve had this go-it- alone policy in the world , which has been very expensive as Larry Korb has made the point . We’ve had a lot of free riders on it . And the end result has been diminishing , particularly in the last -- in the previous administration , diminishing America’s influence in the world . And so one of the ideas of not doing these kinds of things , being selective , having a sensible defense budget is we might actually be able to devote resources in ways that would increase our influence in the world . </s>
You know , we were totally isolated on the issue of global warming . </s>
Everybody else recognizes this as a problem . But the previous administration did n't . Now , you know , the U.S. is back in the mainstream . We did n't need to pull out of Kyoto . We could have consulted . </s>
And there are all sorts of other issues , free flow of technology , things that are very much in our interest where , if we go it alone , other people are n't just -- are n't going to go along with us . Interesting point that you bring up . </s>
I want to bring it to the other side , that you 're arguing that the expansion , let 's say , the opposite of clipping wings , the laissez-faire attitude towards wings , leaving the wings alone , they 're actually saying that your argument for power actually might reduce American influence and power . I do n't think that -- once again , there are hundreds of millions of people around the world who rely on American power for their safety . </s>
I mentioned , for example , the view Eliot mentioned it again , the Japanese . But you made that point before . I -- but Elliott , can you tell -- to their point that they 're saying that there 's a diminished -- more than diminished returns , that the expression of power -- Is a weaker -- </s>
Is diminishing U.S. influence . A weaker American military is going to hurt the influence of this country . Another thing that 's going to hurt the influence of this country is if we are fiscally irresponsible , and we are broke , and we are borrowing billions and billions of dollars . </s>
But I do n't know what else I can do except to quote all those wonderful Clinton officials who say it is n't the military budget that is exploding . It is the entitlements that are exploding . </s>
Nobody wants to hear that , but it 's a fact . And we have to deal with it . Least of all , do politicians in Washington want to hear it . </s>
That 's what we need to deal with to make our economy sound . </s>
Sir down in the second row . </s>
I have a question for the Elliotts , both spellings . And I just do n't want to one word answer here . In your unclipped and unclippable world , do you think we should send ground troops into Libya ? After all , we want him gone , and it will save lives . I guess my own view on Libya is actually we should have pushed a lot harder when Gaddafi was falling . </s>
If the president is going to say that it 's our objective to get rid of him , that we better be very serious , I do n't think we have to commit ground forces in the sense of , you know , infantry brigades . </s>
I do think if you want those -- the rebel forces to succeed on the ground , you probably need to send in the kind of special forces that we have who are good at kind of training and developing local forces , which is sort of what we did to the Taliban . </s>
And my guess is that would be enough . If you 're also willing to commit the air power to it as well . It 's a NATO operation , by the way , as is Afghanistan I have to point out . We 've gone it alone . I visited German soldiers , British soldiers , Canadian soldiers , Norwegian soldiers , for that matter , New Zealanders , Australians and Danes in Afghanistan . </s>
Okay . Let me -- Let me get the question to Lawrence Korb about Libya . Would you -- </s>
No . </s>
And I think basically Obama did it exactly right . The cost to put ground troops on there was too great . The cost to the American defense budget and the taxpayer in terms of doing it all by ourselves was too great . </s>
So basically , this operation after the first week is costing us $ 40 million a month . Basically , that 's affordable . How much is Afghanistan costing ? How much is Iraq costing ? </s>
That 's what I 'm talking about , you 've got to do the - - you know , do the cost benefits . And he decided that , yes , we would like Gaddafi to be gone . </s>
Every -- we 'd like a lot of these people to be gone . </s>
But in terms of the cost to do that , it would -- to put ground troops on and all that was just too great . And I think we have actually moved away in our military strategy the way we were doing it in Yemen with the Special Forces and the drones , the way we 're doing it in Pakistan and the drones . That is a cost benefit way to do it rather than sending in large numbers of ground troops . Another question ? </s>
Yes , ma'am , your -- yeah , yeah , yeah . Emphatic . Hi . I visited the Islamic republic of Iran 10 days before their election in 2009 , their presidential election , on vacation . And I 've been writing about Iran ever since then , partly in dismay of what happened with their presidential election and the crackdown . </s>
In terms of China and -- But can -- -- of U.S. and Iran -- Is this your question coming ? </s>
Yes . It is now , just to give you background . So I 'm writing mostly for an Iranian audience , actually , so you might want to speak of that when you 're also answering too . </s>
China -- China is buying a lot of U.S. bonds . </s>
And that 's part of how we 're financing our military . </s>
So when we use a lot of military , we do go further into debt . I think it 's important -- do you -- do you also think it 's important to not underestimate cultural wars or soft wars because the Iranians are very focused also on that , like they 're very afraid of Facebook and YouTube . </s>
The State Department has -- </s>
All right . I think I see your question . You 're using other weapons , softer weapons , for example . I 'm assuming both sides are in favor of that . It 's cost effective . </s>
We need to do more of it . We need to do it more intelligently . And I would ask a question back to you . </s>
Do you think those demonstrators in the streets of Tehran , who exposed themselves to what they got would be voting in favor of this proposition . </s>
There 's a combination of Iranians that are inside and outside of Iran . But the ones that are inside , there are a lot of them that are in jail now unfortunately because they 've all been arrested . But also there have been a lot of revolutions in the Middle East , and they had a lot to do with people not having good jobs and so on and so forth . </s>
But to his question , do you think that the -- that the -- those who are standing up against these regimes would be discouraged to hear an argument that America needs its global wings clipped , or would they find that understandable and acceptable and realistic ? </s>
The people I know who are involved in -- that actually do live inside of Iran , and I 'm in contact with probably about a hundred people inside Iran now , and many of them were protesters . I do n't -- from what I hear from them , they 're not thinking that a military invasion would really be a good idea . Okay . </s>
And that 's -- but they 're not happy with the position that they 're in . </s>
So if there are other ways to sort of balance the power so that -- or other ways to show a good example of government 's -- Okay , ma'am , I just need to get to some other questions . But I think you should get a chair on our next debate on Iran , on the stage . </s>
Thank you very much for bringing it up . Sir , in the front row . Yeah . Third row . </s>
My apologies . My question is , if we clip America 's wings , how do we combat radical Islam ? And if we expand our global wings , how do we combat radical Islam because we -- you know – it’s growing -- You know what ? Take a minute -- take 15 seconds longer and decode what your point is . </s>
You 're saying it 's a no-win situation either way ? </s>
Well , I just want to hear how do we combat it on either end of the debate . Okay . </s>
First to this side for a more modest policy . Well , here is the problem . </s>
We have this huge investment in Afghanistan which is because , as actually happened , the September 11th tax began there . However , we 're not really -- we 're not fighting al-Qaeda there . We 're fighting a Pashtun insurgency . Al-Qaeda is now present in Pakistan , Somalia , Yemen and probably certainly more present in probably in Europe than it is -- But to his question , are you -- </s>
-- in Afghanistan . And so the misallocation of resources by this kind of expansive nation-building mission is diverting us from dealing with Iraq . His question -- his question is about another world in which going forward , if we 're going to have to make hard choices , he 's asking would a world operating under those rules be able to confront radical Islam . </s>
Lawrence , do you want to take it ? Yeah . You 've got to confront these violent extremists basically not by killing them . Rumsfeld said you ca n't kill all the terrorists . </s>
Basically , what you have to do is undermine their narrative . And by going into Iraq , which turned out to be for the wrong reasons , you enhance the al-Qaeda narrative . And so I think what we have to do is live up to our values at home , and that will help . I mean , Peter was talking about the fact that the American opinion around the world has gone up . </s>
That 's important . That 's how you 're going -- you 're not going to be able to kill them all . </s>
You have to undermine their narrative . You know the American opinion in the Muslim world went up when we -- after we helped the people in Indonesia . </s>
But how does that relate to a more modest exertion of power ? Well , it means you do n't use your military to do it . It 's basically you live at home -- Because it 's counterproductive and makes enemies . Is that what your argument is ? </s>
It can make enemies ? That 's what you 're saying has happened in Iraq , Afghanistan . </s>
Yes , yes , I am saying that , yeah . </s>
Okay . Let me take it to the other side . Well , I 'm -- let Elliott finish . Which Elliott will take this ? Eliot Cohen . </s>
Well , I guess my first thought is , a moment ago you were all in favor of targeted killing in Pakistan and Yemen , so , I mean , that’s -- I’m in favor of living up to our ideals at home , but you were in favor of drones , let’s remember what those drones do . </s>
Secondly , I very much believe in American soft power , and that’s what we should be exercising to the best we can in places that are likely to be the incubators of radical Islam , that means being more involved in places like Indonesia to take just one case , rather than less . I mean , again , remember what this proposition’s about . This is not a debate about the use of military power ; it’s about America’s global role . I would just add here , you know , living up to our ideals at home is not going to end the threat of Islamic extremism . </s>
One of our ideals at home is equality for women , and the more we live up to that , the more they’re going to hate us because they don’t believe in it . So that is not a solution . I think there is a one solution , but a key part of it as Eliot just said , is what we do in those countries . I can’t think of a better thing to do than support the expansion of democracy through soft power , not by invading 15 countries , but I think that what is happening now in the Middle East with the Arab revolts , is just killing al-Qaeda because we see what people in those countries want , they want democracy , they want free elections , they want an end to censorship and the secret police , and al-Qaeda isn’t even addressing any of those things . So the expansion of democracy in the Arab world is one of the best things we can do to fight al-Qaeda . </s>
And how does -- how do we do that with the use of American force ? </s>
You’re not going to do it -- you do it with soft power mostly , but it is harder to make your soft power felt if people think that your country is in decline and your wings are being clipped . That’s just the nature of the world . And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . </s>
And here’s where we are . You are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn . They will be two minutes each , and remember , you voted before the debate on your view on this motion , and we’re going to ask you to vote once again afterwards . This is their last chance to try to change your minds . </s>
So , round three , closing statements by each debater in turn . Our motion is , “It’s time to clip America’s global wings.” </s>
And here to summarize his position against the motion , Eliot Cohen , professor at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University and former counselor at the Department of State . Our opponents would have liked the motion to be resolved , the Bush administration acted like a bunch of arrogant , wasteful , strategic nincompoops in Iraq and Afghanistan , but that wasn’t the topic . I mean , I turned down a topic that I thought was pretty silly . The topic is , “It’s time to clip America’s global wings . '' You know , you can’t assess these things as if they were some sort of scientific proof , they’re not , but let me offer one way of thinking about it , and one way of formulating your judgments . </s>
Who in the world would be likely to vote for this resolution , who would be likely to vote against it ? So here 's some of the people in my list who would vote for it . I think Vladimir Putin would vote for it , I think Kim Jong-il would vote for it , I think Mr. Chávez in Venezuela would vote for it , and I think -- I am sure President Ahmadinejad would vote for it . </s>
Who would vote against it ? Prime Minister Salam Fayyad of the Palestinian authority , and Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu of Israel , Aung San Suu Kyi in Burma , and I suspect the Dalai Lama , those demonstrators in the streets of Tehran that we talked about , the Kurds , the Kosovars , the Bosniaks , the people of Japan , of Australia , Kenya , Columbia , Darfur . I know which group of people I’d rather be with . </s>
Thank you . Eliot Cohen , speaking against the motion , which is , “It’s time to clip America’s global wings.” And here to summarize his position for the motion , Peter Galbraith , a former U.S. diplomat who served as deputy special representative of the U.N. and Afghanistan and was the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia . In an op-ed piece in the Washington Post on Sunday , Meghan O’Sullivan , who was an official in the Bush administration , wrote about lessons of Libya that came from Iraq . </s>
And one of them was that she said , “Early decisions can have long term consequences . '' </s>
In effect , we made a big mistake deciding that Iraq would have a federal system . </s>
Well , guess what , it wasn’t America’s decision to be made . It had been made a decade before by the Iraqis , and that really comes to my point . This world , it’s not all about us . It’s about -- what’s happening in the Middle East is not because they sat down and they read Jefferson or the Federalist Papers . </s>
It is an indigenous movement of people in the Arab world , and it’s terrific . But it isn’t because of something that we’ve done or not done . But we have the potential by intervening , as we did in Iraq with an expansive nation-building exercise , as we’ve done in Afghanistan , as we’re still doing , try and build a central government where none has existed , of undermining our credibility of wasting our resources . We have to remember that military power is not the end-all and be-all of power . </s>
Power is a lot of things . Influence doesn’t always come at the point of a gun . It may relate to your prestige . </s>
In 2000 , America’s prestige was sky-high , again , after Bosnia , Kosovo , and East Timor . We had a lot of influence in the world . We exercised a lot of military power in this last decade . </s>
And by the end of the previous administration , our power and our influence in the world , our ability to make things happen , was rock-bottom . We’re climbing back , but it’s awfully slow . Thank you , Peter Galbraith . Our motion is `` It 's time to clip America 's global wings . '' And here to summarize his position against the motion , Elliot Abrams , a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations , who served as deputy national security adviser in the George W. Bush administration . </s>
My argument , in closing , has been summarized by someone else . I just want to read five sentences . </s>
“There will be times when our safety is not directly threatened , but our interests and values are . Sometimes the course of history poses challenges that threaten our common humanity and our common security : responding to natural disasters , preventing genocide , keeping the peace , ensuring regional security , maintaining the flow of commerce . These may not be America’s problems alone , but they are important to us . They are problems worth solving . </s>
And in these circumstances we know that the United States as the world’s most powerful nation will often be called upon to help . But let us also remember that for generations we have done the hard work of protecting our own people as well as millions around the globe.” That’s President Obama , and he’s right . </s>
If we are to be safe , if we are to be free , we really can’t escape the world as it is . We can not escape the need to have and sometimes to use military power . </s>
On the wings that you’re being asked to clip ride the hopes of hundreds of millions of Americans and many more people all over the globe , hopes for freedom and security , hopes for a better future - - for the sake of those people , for the sake of their freedom as well as ours , reject this proposition . Don’t clip the eagle’s wings . Thank you , Elliot Abrams . And our motion is : `` It 's time to clip America 's global wings . '' And here to summarize his position for the motion , our final speaker , Lawrence Korb , senior fellow at the Center for American -- </s>
Since you’ve mentioned it -- Lawrence , let me -- I just wanted to do an introduction , sorry . Oh , oh , okay . Lawrence -- no , no -- we’ll reset . Sorry . </s>
Lawrence Korb , a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress , who served as Assistant Secretary of Defense during the Reagan administration . Let me go back -- I was , in the beginning , questioned on my Republican credentials by quoting a couple of Republican presidents , though , I think summarize the point that Peter and I have been trying to make . “Maybe I’m missing something here , but we should encourage people who live in those lands” -- he asked about nation building -- “to build their own nations , ” George Bush , 2000 , when he was running for president . You remember the humble foreign policy . </s>
That’s the point we’re trying to make . Let me quote from another Republican . </s>
“Every gun that is made , every warship launched , every rocket fired signified in the final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed , those who are cold and are not clothed.” </s>
If you take a look at what the Republican Party today , if you look at Paul Ryan and what he’s proposing , he wants to increase defense spending and then cut the things that are not going to help us improve our standing in science , are not going to help us be more competitive in the world . And what we’re opposed to , by clipping the wings , is to get over these reckless military adventures that we’ve undertaken in the first part of this century , something we hadn’t really done since Vietnam . And let me conclude with this . You’ve heard all the apocalyptic scenarios . I remember when people said , if you got out of Vietnam , all Southeast Asia and Communism and all that kind of stuff . </s>
Elliott meant you were going back to Cam Ranh Bay . I spent a little bit of time there , you know , about 40 years ago . Why are we going back ? This is the people that we basically recognized we could not make them what we would like them to be . </s>
But they 're doing okay now . And I think that 's the point we want to make . We ca n't do it all . We 're going to have to clip our wings when something happens . </s>
But look inside all your clothes and things like that . Go down to Nike and find out where your running shoes are made . That turned out pretty well , even though we clipped our wings back in the '70s . Lawrence Korb , thank you very much . </s>
And that concludes closing statements . And now it 's time to learn which side you , our live audience , believes has argued best . I 'm going to ask you to go again to your key pads . Our motion is , “It 's time to clip America 's global wings.” </s>
If you agree with this motion , after hearing the arguments , push number one . If you disagree , push number two . If you became or remain undecided , push number three . </s>
And we 'll have the -- we 'll have the results in about a minute and a half . But first I want to take care of a couple of things , one of which , most obviously , is to thank this panel for bringing a very , very intelligent debate to Intelligence Squared . I also want to thank everybody who had the guts to stand up and take a microphone in the audience even if the question did n't pass my filter . I appreciated that you did it . And I did hear some very good idea for future debates , though they 're not related to tonight 's . </s>
Thank you very much . We also want to point out , Intelligence Squared is run as a very , very lean operation . And we are going to be losing one of our key players who 's moving on to other things by her own choice . </s>
Lindsay Nelson has been with the organization nearly since the beginning . She is responsible , in fact , for having designed this set , for making the television broadcast possible , for bringing us to this theater . She has designed the programs that are in your hands . </s>
She is possibly the youngest member of our staff , so she keeps everyone but me hip . </s>
And we 're going to miss her tremendously because her impact on this has been profound , and we just want to -- I 'm not sure if she 's even in the room here . But if she is , she 's probably hiding under a chair at this point . </s>
We want to thank her with a real round of applause for everything she 's done . So our theme this spring has been “America 's house divided.” And our last debate of the season is on Tuesday the 3rd of May . The motion will be , do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . We have arguing for this motion , Kris Kobach . </s>
Kris Kobach has been the driving force behind most of the controversial immigration laws sweeping the country , including Arizona 's Senate bill 1070 . </s>
He is now leading a movement to eliminate birth right citizenship through state legislation . </s>
Joining him will be former Colorado congressman Tom Tancredo , who has called amnesty a terrible policy and terrible politics . And he once advocated for a civics literacy test as a prerequisite for voting . Against the motion is Julian Castro . </s>
He is the youngest mayor ever to be elected to the country 's seventh largest city , San Antonio , Texas . After his win , The Economist declared `` Castro has the charm , the brains and the boldness to one day become a Hispanic Barack Obama . '' His partner will be Tamar Jacoby , who over the years has gone from being an editor at Newsweek and The New York Times to becoming one of the pro-immigration movement 's most conservative voices . She is now the president and CEO of Immigration Works USA . Tickets to our future -- or our next debate are available to the website and at the Skirball box office . </s>
And do n't forget to follow Intelligence Squared U.S. on Twitter and make sure to become a fan on Facebook . And if you do , you 'll receive a discount on future debates . And as I said earlier , all of our debates can be heard on NPR stations across the country . And you can watch them on Bloomberg Television , this debate on Bloomberg Television starting next Monday . </s>
If you visit Bloomberg.com , you 'll find out where to go for your local channel . Okay . It 's all in . </s>
I have the results now . </s>
Here is how you voted before the debate . On the motion , “It 's time to clip America 's global wings , ” before the debate , 37 percent were for the motion , 26 percent against , 37 percent undecided . After the debate , 47 percent are for the motion . </s>
That 's up 10 percent . </s>
44 percent are against . </s>
That is up 18 percent . And nine percent are undecided . </s>
That means the team arguing against the motion , “It 's time to clip America 's global wings” has won this debate . Our congratulations to them . Thank you from me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S . null </s>
I want to introduce to you , Robert Rosenkranz , Chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , the sponsor of this evening’s debate , who will make some opening remarks . Thank you , Brian , and , and welcome to all of you . I’m Robert Rosenkranz , Chairman of Intelligence Squared , which is an initiative of the Rosenkranz Foundation . With me tonight is Dana Wolfe , the Executive Producer of this , series of debates . I see a number of , uh , a lot of familiar faces in the audience but also a lot of newcomers . </s>
So let me just say a word about why we’re , we’re doing this . It’s really with the intention of raising the level of public discourse in this country . It comes from a feeling that , uh , political conversations are just too rancorous and that , this nation could benefit from a forum for reasoned discussion of , key policy issues . The topic tonight is , is one that , uh , has attracted an enormous amount of , of interest . The proposition : Global warming is not a crisis . </s>
And the , panelists are going to try to persuade you to vote for or against the motion . Uh , ultimately your votes will decide which side has carried the day . Uh , well , why this particular , topic ? Senator Barbara Boxer , Al Gore have assured us that on this particular topic the debate is over . Well , we took that as throwing down the gauntlet and I personally am cynical enough to think that perhaps there’s a distinction between science and political science . </s>
Um , and maybe a side that feels like there is nothing to debate , might feel that there are perhaps some inconvenient truths on the other side that they would prefer not to deal with . I’m old enough to remember when there was a , uh , scientific consensus on global cooling , and this was in the 1970s with all kinds of alarmist data on that subject . </s>
I’m enough of a businessman to know that the modeling and the use of the computer , uh , algorithms and forecasting the future is a very , very difficult undertaking . I mean , if one could predict , uh , the weather or patterns of storms even a year in advance it would be worth billions and billions of dollars to people engaged in energy trading or , uh , or , insurance underwriting and a whole bunch of other pursuits . And yet it can’t really be effectively done . So tonight’s debate , I think , is addressing issues that for me are very real and , which , at Intelligence Squared we feel can use some serious enlightenment . Uh , first of all , on the science of it . </s>
Does science really have the , the ability to tell us with , with a good degree of reliability what is going to happen to our climate over a hundred year period ? And secondly , the economics . </s>
Um , this all leads in effect to public policies that say , We should invest , money now for benefits in the future . Well , that always poses the traditional questions of , well , what are the costs ? </s>
What are the benefits ? What are the alternatives ? What are the risks of action ? What are the risks of inaction ? </s>
So there are a whole welter of economic aspects that I think , hopefully tonight we’re going to get some enlightenment on as well . Uh , this evening , of course , is a live event but it will reach an audience through National Public Radio of over fifty radio stations around the country . </s>
We’re produced for radio by by WNYC in New York . And it’s now time for me to turn the , uh , proceedings over to Brian Lehrer , who is the award winning host of , WNYC’s New York public radio call in program , The Brian Lehrer Show . This has been called New York City’s most thoughtful and informative talk show by Time magazine . It covers politics and life locally , globally . Brian not only holds a master’s degree in journalism but also a master’s in public health and environmental studies . </s>
So he is very well equipped to lead these proceedings and to introduce the extraordinary group of panelists who are the real stars of tonight’s event . Thank you very much . And , Bob , thank you so much . I so personally appreciate your commitment to public discourse at a high level . </s>
We need much more of that in this country . I would like to welcome you all formally to the sixth Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . Let me give you a brief run-down of the evening . First , the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument . The opposition will follow . </s>
Each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we will go back and forth from one side to the other . Second , when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks I will do some follow-up questioning and open up the floor to brief questions from the audience . </s>
And when I say brief , I do mean brief . We have , we are limited to twenty minutes for the entire follow-up discussion after the eight minute presentations . And so I ask that you limit your questions to thirty seconds and not give any speeches tonight and I will do the same in my follow-up questions . Uh , third , when the Q and A is complete , each debater will make a final statement , not lasting more than two minutes per person . </s>
And fourth , during the closing statements , uh , ballot boxes will be passed around for voting . </s>
You have your tickets . This is what the ballot box looks like and you will put in either the “for” piece , the “against” piece or the whole ticket if you still don’t know which side you favor . If anyone does not have a ticket ballot – are you snickering at the very idea of being undecided or ambivalent ? This is what we’ve come to ? </s>
Um , an usher will get you a ballot at the appropriate moment if you still need one . </s>
And fifth , and last , after the final closing statement is made I will announce the results of the audience vote and tell you which side carried the day . Now , to introduce the panel . For the motion , author and filmmaker , best known as the author of Jurassic Park and the creator of E.R. , Michael Crichton . The Alfred P. Sloan Professor of Meteorology in the Department of Earth , Atmosphere and Planetary Sciences at MIT , Richard S. Lindzen . And Emeritus Professor of Biogeography at the University of London , School of Oriental and African Studies , Philip Stott . </s>
Against the motion : Climate Scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists , Brenda Ekwurzel . Climate Modeler at the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies , Gavin Schmidt . And distinguished Professor of , uh – I’m sorry . And distinguished Professor at Scripps Institution of Oceanography , University of California , San Diego – Richard C.J . Somerville . And that was all very polite . </s>
I couldn’t tell how many people voted for or against the motion . </s>
All right , first , for the motion : Richard Lindzen . Please go to the microphone . Okay , I’d like to thank Intelligence Squared , the staff , Bob Rosenkranz , Brian Lehrer and of course , our worthy opponents , for the opportunity to debate the proposition : Global warming is not a crisis . Please keep in mind what the proposition is . It is not a debate over whether the earth has been warming over the past century . </s>
Uh , the earth is always warming or cooling , at least a few tenths of a degree . And we’re talking about , so far , something on the order of six tenths of a degree centigrade . We’re not even arguing about whether greenhouse gas emissions are contributing at some level to warming . And they most certainly should or I would suggest it would be very little . </s>
Indeed , as far as I can tell , even our opponents do not claim that global warming is a crisis at present . </s>
Rather , we are primarily addressing the future . Now , much of the current alarm , I would suggest , is based on ignorance of what is normal for weather and climate . Extreme weather events occur all the time . There’s , there is really no evidence of systematic increases , judging from reports from bodies ranging from the National Hurricane Center to the U.N.’s Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change . In fact , outside the tropics the theory of such storms and variability says that the variability should decrease in a warmer world . </s>
Thus , if this is a matter of crisis for where we live the world is in a permanent state of crisis and will be less prone to crisis in a warmer world . Sea level has also been a matter of concern , I think largely because it’s very telegenic , as opposed to a half degree of temperature . And sea level has been increasing since the end of the last Ice Age glaciation , with the most rapid change increase about twelve thousand years ago . In recent centuries the rate has been relatively uniform , averaged over ten year periods . </s>
Uh , it amounts to a couple of millimeters per year and this is residual of much larger positive and negative changes locally . Uh , those changes are due to tectonics . And , and the risk , if you’re worried about sea level change , from these changes is larger than it is from warming . </s>
The impact of warming on agriculture is not easy to ascertain . But , for example , India has warmed in the second half of the twentieth century and agricultural output has increased greatly . The impact on disease seems dubious at best , according to articles in Lancet . Infectious diseases like malaria are not so much a matter of temperature as of poverty and public health , most notably the elimination of DDT . </s>
Malaria is still endemic in Siberia and was once so in Michigan . Exposure , I would suggest , to cold is generally found to be both more dangerous and less comfortable . Now , recently the IPCC summary for policy maker came out and it had an iconic claim about man’s impact on temperature change . Uh , does this imply crisis ? </s>
Well , the impact on temperature per unit carbon dioxide actually goes down , not up , with increasing CO2 . Uh , the role of anthropogenic greenhouse gases is not directly related to the emissions rate or even CO2 levels , which is what the legislation is hitting on , but rather to the impact of these gases on the greenhouse effect . Uh , modelers use double CO2 as a convenient benchmark and on the basis of current models , it’s claimed that this should lead to about one and a half to four and a half degrees warming . What is less often noted is in terms of greenhouse forcing we’re already three quarters of the way to that doubling . And we’ve only seen point six degrees . </s>
And there’s no reason to suppose , furthermore , that this is all due to man . </s>
Now , this certainly does not support the model forecasts upon which alarm is based . Modelers commonly claim it’s still possible that aerosols have canceled much of the greenhouse warming . Unfortunately , the impact of aerosols is considered by the IPCC to be virtually unknown . And indeed , many people consider that canceling the warming involves a larger effect than seems plausible . There have also been claims that warming has been delayed by the ocean . </s>
But the results I’ve mentioned are from coupled models involving the atmosphere in the ocean . And in many of these the oceans have been tuned to have particularly long delays . And I think it’s crucial to distinguish between the claim that models can display past behavior from the actual situation , which is that models can be adjusted to display past behavior once that behavior is known . There is no reason to suppose that the adjustment corrected the relevant error . It is worth adding that warming , instead of accelerating , has been essentially absent for about the last ten years . </s>
So the iconic statement is itself not indicative of crisis . And one could , if one had time , explain why the iconic statement itself may very well not be true . The major defense of the statement is modelers can not think of anything else that gave warming over the last thirty years . But these are the same models that can not account for the Medieval warm period , or for that matter , even do a good job of replicating El Nino . So even the basis for the iconic statement is not particularly meaningful . </s>
So crisis is not a product of current observations . </s>
One . I suggest it’s not even a product of projections . Now , there is no reason to suppose that anything will cause a threshold to change this assessment . </s>
We’re still talking about a two per cent imbalance and we’re also talking about the impact of CO2 per unit CO2 that decreases . This is not the usual condition for a threshold . Moreover , there are positive reasons to suspect that greenhouse warming is not significant . </s>
The real signature of greenhouse warming is not surface temperature but temperature in the middle of the troposphere , about five kilometers . And that is going up even slower than the temperature at the surface . </s>
Finally , the underlying present concern is not the greenhouse effect , per se . </s>
Doubling CO2 by itself only gives you one degree warming . </s>
The -- Richard Lindzen , thank you very much for your opening statement . Okay . I do have to cut you off there . By the way , audience , you may feel free to , to applaud . </s>
Uh , you can give polite applause , you can give enthusiastic applause . </s>
Uh , that is your right . </s>
Of course , we ask that nobody shout anything out . Richard Somerville , the next statement is yours . </s>
The motion before us , global warming is not a crisis , means we ought to know what crisis means . The word does not mean catastrophe or alarmism . It means a crucial or decisive moment , a turning point , a state of affairs in which a decisive change for better or worse is imminent . </s>
We are talking about the future here . The entire world now really does have a critical choice to make . It is whether to continue on the present path of adding more and more carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases to the atmosphere or whether to find another path . We’re speaking of the future . </s>
And science tells us that the path we choose will largely determine what kind of earth our children and grandchildren will inherit . Our task tonight is to persuade you that global warming is indeed a crisis in exactly that precise sense so you should vote against the motion . The science community today has impeccable settled science , despite what you have just heard , that demonstrates the reality of global warming and its primary origin in human activities . We fully understand the fundamental physics behind the greenhouse effect . </s>
We also now have persuasive observational evidence of dramatic changes already taking place in the climate system , changes that are not in any sense small . Mankind’s fingerprints have now clearly emerged above the noise of natural variability . </s>
That is the primary message of the intergovernmental panel , climate panel , the panel on climate change report that Professor Lindzen referred to – the IPCC . We also have powerful tools to prode…project many aspects of the future climate with considerable confidence . We take into account other important factors besides greenhouse gases – the sun , volcanoes , pollution particles . Some of our forecasts have already come true . A group of people dispute these consensus findings of mainstream scientists . </s>
Call them contrarians . </s>
Some are here in this very room . Contrarians are not unique to climate . They exist in many fields of science . There are a few retrovirus experts , fully credentialed , who don’t think that HIV causes AIDS . The New Yorker this week , many of you will have seen , writes about them . </s>
When the revolution of continental drift was sweeping through geology and geophysics , some imminent earth scientists couldn’t be persuaded that plate tectonics were real . Continents can move . These contrarians were mistaken . They faded from the scene . </s>
Experience , long experience shows that in science it tends to be the rare exception rather than the rule when a lone genius eventually prevails over conventional mainstream scientific thought . An occasional Galileo does come along or an Einstein . Not often . Most people who think they’re a Galileo are just wrong . </s>
We’re talking here about managing risk for the future . It’s a big risk to the planet to bet it on the contrarians . Here’s a brief look at some of what we know . </s>
The IPC said…C said , quote : Warming of the climate system is unequivocal , unquote -- based on many kinds of observations . Also our knowledge of ancient climates tells us that the warmth of the last half century is unusual in at least the previous three…thirteen hundred years . </s>
The IPC said…C said , Most of the observed increase in global av…globally averaged temperatures in recent decades is very likely due to the observed increase in human caused greenhouse gas concentrations . These are summary conclusions of , of experts . In a painstaking process , lasting , uh , years with thirty thousand reviewer comments , each log numbered responded to by teams of experts who represent , um , the mainstream science and who take into account views from the fringes as well . There’s never been as thorough and vetted a process for summarizing science precisely for the point of making input to policy makers . </s>
Nothing said here tonight in a few minutes that we have can possibly undermine , uh , this powerful statement from the scientific community . We also project a further warming of a half a degree Fahrenheit for the next twenty-five years . Beyond that it does depend largely on how much more CO2 and other greenhouse gases humanity dumps into the atmosphere . </s>
Global warming since the nineteenth century is already more than a degree Fahrenheit . It’s continuing . </s>
Of the twelve warmest years in the instrumental record , uh , eleven of them have occurred in the most recent twelve years globally . 2006 was the sixth warmest year in this record globally and the warmest year of all in the U.S. Arctic temperatures in the last hundred years increased twice as much as the global average . Since 1950 the number of heat waves globally has increased . The heat wave in Europe in 2003 that killed more than thirty thousand people was unprecedented in modern times . Intense tropical cyclone activity , the IPCC concludes , has increased in the North Atlantic region since about 1970 . </s>
The global ocean , down to a depth of at least six thousand feet , has been warming since the early 1960s . This warming is contributing to sea level rise . It’s by no means all vestiges of the last Ice Age . </s>
Sea level rose some seven inches over the twentieth century . The rate of rise has apparently increased recently . Water vapor in the atmosphere , as predicted , is increasing as the world warms . This additional water feeds back . </s>
It’s a greenhouse gas . It amplifies the warming . It’s as though you had your house wired funny so that when it got warm the thermostat turned on the furnace and made it warmer still . Snow cover and mountain glaciers are decreasing markedly . It’s a long list . </s>
The list goes on . None of these observational facts is a surprise to the climate science community . They are what we had predicted . </s>
We scientists have been expecting measurements like these and now we see them . The question for the future is simply how much worse do we , do we intend ? How much more severe , uh , will we let these trends become ? The science warns us that continuing to fuel the world using present technology will bring dangerous and possibly surprising climate changes by the end of this century , if not sooner . </s>
Business as usual implies more heat waves , higher sea levels , disrupted rainfall patterns , vanishing glaciers and much more . Limiting carbon dioxide amounts to any reasonable level will take large cuts in emissions . It takes time . We have a giant intra… infrastructure based on fossil fuels . </s>
To have a meaningful effect by mid-century we need to start soon . </s>
The question is really whether humanity has the collective determination to act in any meaningful way . The economic case can be made convincingly , once people understand the cost of doing nothing or too little . It’s like elective surgery . </s>
It’s , uh , not free to decline it . Technology can accomplish great things once society is committed to such a goal . </s>
We know now that humanity has already increased atmospheric carbon dioxide by thirty-five per cent above natural levels . And humanity , as a group , by default or on purpose , will now decide what level it wants to tolerate . Then , after humanity has made this decision , how much CO2 do you want in your children and grandchildren’s atmosphere , which – One . …after that , nature will have its say and the climate system will change in response to the level of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere . </s>
Nature is superbly indifferent to politics and , and spin . But it will have the last word , uh , in this debate . </s>
I have a few seconds and I’ll say a few words about the IPCC . I’ve been a coordinating lead author in it , uh , for three years . I’ve , I was in Paris last month when this summary was negotiated and released . It’s an extraordinarily impressive international collaboration -- thirty thousand review comments , a hundred and fifty , uh , authors – seventy-five per cent of whom , by the way , were new to the process . </s>
We’re not a clique defending what we said six years ago . </s>
And I urge you to familiarize yourself with the science because the science here has spoken very plainly . Thank you . Thank you , Richard Somerville . Michael Crichton , you have the next statement . </s>
The microphone goes up . </s>
Before I begin I want to just say one brief thing about what Richard has just told you . </s>
He’s , he’s giving you the story of plate tectonics but it’s fascinating . He’s turned it upside down . He’s turned it on its head . </s>
The story of plate tectonics actually is the story of one person who had the right idea – Alfred Wegener . He had it in 1912 . And it is the story of major scientists at Harvard and elsewhere opposing him for decade after decade until finally it was proven to be incorrect what they were believing . </s>
So it is , in fact -- when I was a kid I was told the continents didn’t move . </s>
It is , in fact , perfectly possible for the consensus of scientists to be wrong and it is , in fact , perfectly possible for small numbers of people to be in opposition and they will be ultimately be proven true . I want to address the issue of crisis in a somewhat different way . </s>
Does it really matter if we have a crisis at all ? I mean , haven’t we actually raised temperatures so much that we , as stewards of the planet , have to act ? </s>
These are the questions that friends of mine ask as they are getting on board their private jets to fly to their second and third homes . </s>
And I would like , with their permission , to take the question just a little bit more seriously . I myself , uh , just a few years ago , held the kinds of views that I , uh , expect most of you in this room hold . </s>
That’s to say , I had a very conventional view about the environment . I thought it was going to hell . I thought human beings were responsible and I thought we had to do something about it . I hadn’t actually looked at any environmental issues in detail but I have that general view . </s>
And so in 2000 , when I read an article that suggested that the evidence for global warming might not be quite as firm as people said , I immediately dismissed it . Not believe in global warming ? That’s ridiculous . </s>
How could you have such an idea ? Are you going to try and tell me that the planet isn’t getting warmer ? I know it’s getting warmer . I grew up in Long Island . </s>
And when I was a kid we always had days off from school for hurricanes . There are no hurricanes on Long Island now . I spent thirty years in California . We used to have something called June gloom . Now it’s more like May , June , July , August gloom with September , October , November gloom added in . </s>
The weather is very different . </s>
However , because I look for trouble , um , I went at a certain point and started looking at the temperature records . And I was very surprised at what I found . </s>
The first thing that I discovered , which Dick has already told you , is that the increase in temperatures so far over the last hundred years , is on the order of six-tenths of a degree Celsius , about a degree Fahrenheit . I hadn’t really thought , when we talked about global warming , about how much global warming really was taking place . </s>
The second thing I discovered was that everything is a concern about the future and the future is defined by models . The models tell us that human beings are the cause of the warming , that human beings , uh , producing all this CO2 , are what’s actually driving the climate warming that we’re seeing now . But I was interested to see that the models , as far as I could tell , were not really reliable . That is to say , that past estimates have proven incorrect . Uh , in 1988 , when James Hanson talked to the Congress and said that global warming had finally arrived , The New York Times published a model result that suggested that in the next hundred years there would be twelve degrees Celsius increase . </s>
A few years later the increase was estimated to be six degrees , then four degrees . The most recent U.N. estimate is three degrees . Will it continue to go down ? </s>
I expect so . And this left me in a kind of a funny position . </s>
But let me first be clear about exactly what I’m saying . </s>
Is the globe warming ? Yes . Is the greenhouse effect real ? Yes . Is carbon dioxide , a greenhouse gas , being increased by men ? Yes . </s>
Would we expect this warming to have an effect ? Yes . Do human beings in general effect the climate ? Yes . But none of that answers the core question of whether or not carbon dioxide is the contemporary driver for the warming we’re seeing . </s>
And as far as I could tell scientists had , had postulated that but they hadn’t demonstrated it . So I’m kinda stranded here . I’ve got half a degree of warming , models that I don’t think are reliable . And what , how am I going to think about the future ? I reasoned in this way : if we’re going to have one degree increase , maybe if , if , climate doesn’t change and if , uh , and if there’s no change in technology – but of course , if you don’t imagine there will be a change in technology in the next hundred years you’re a very unusual person . </s>
And I also was aware that we have actually been starting to do exactly the kind of thing that we ought to do , which is to decarbonize . Jesse Ausubel at Rockefeller University points out , for example , that starting about a hundred and fifty years ago , in the time of Abraham Lincoln and Queen Victoria , we began to move from wood to coal , from coal to oil , from oil to natural gas and so on . Decreasing our carbon , increasing our hydrogen makes perfect sense , makes environmental sense , makes political sense , makes geopolitical sense . And we’ll continue to do it without any legislation , without any , anything forcing us to do it , as nothing forced us to get off horses . Well , if this is the situation , I suddenly think about my friends , you know , getting on their private jets . </s>
And I think , well , you know , maybe they have the right idea . Maybe all that we have to do is mouth a few platitudes , show a good , you know , expression of concern on our faces , buy a Prius , drive it around for a while and give it to the maid , attend a few fundraisers and you’re done . </s>
Because , actually , all anybody really wants to do is talk about it . They don’t actually do anything . </s>
And the evidence for that is the number of major leaders in climate who clearly have no intention of changing their lifestyle , reducing their own consumption or getting off private jets themselves . </s>
If they’re not willing to do it why should anybody else ? Is talking enough ? I mean , is , is -- the talking cure of the environment , it didn’t work in psychology . It won’t work in the environment either . </s>
Is that enough to do ? I don’t think so . I think it’s totally inadequate . Everyday 30,000 people on this planet die of the diseases of poverty . </s>
There are , a third of the planet doesn’t have electricity . We have a billion people with no clean water , we have half a billion people going to bed hungry every night . Do we care about this ? </s>
It seems that we don’t . It seems that we would rather look a hundred years into the future than pay attention to what’s going on now . I think that 's unacceptable . I think that’s really a disgrace . One . </s>
This doesn’t need to happen . We’re allowing it to happen . And I don’t know what’s wrong with the rich self-centered societies that we live in in the west that we are not paying attention to the conditions of the wider world . And it does seem to me that if we use arguments about the environment to turn our back on the sick and the dying of our shared world , and that 's our excuse to ignore them , then we have done a true and terrible thing . </s>
And it’s awful , thank you . Thank you Michael Crichton . </s>
Gavin Schmidt , you have the podium next . Thank you . I want to talk to you a little about the nature of this public debate . And I want to give you some background to what you’ve been hearing so far , and what you’ll hear a little bit later on . </s>
The issue of global warming and whether it’s a crisis or not , is in fact a scientific decision , it’s a scientific issue . It’s not a political one . On the other hand , deciding what to do about it is obviously political . </s>
Science can inform those decisions , but it can’t determine what decisions society makes . But we’re here to debate the existence of the problem and whether it is a crisis . That 's something that the scientists on this side are eminently suited to do . You’ve all seen or heard about the CSI police drama , where high tech forensic scientists try and work out who done it when they come across the scene of a crime . Well think of climate scientists as CSI planet Earth , we’re try- , we see a climate change and we try and work out what’s done it . </s>
Just like on CSI we have a range of high tech instruments to give us clues , satellites , ocean probes , radar , a worldwide network of weather stations and sophisticated computer programs to help us make sense of it all . The aim is to come to the most likely explanation of all the facts fully anticipating that in the real world there are always going to be anomalies , there are always going to be uncertainties . Conclusions will be preliminary and always open to revision in the light of new evidence . </s>
If this all sounds familiar , it’s because it’s exactly the same approach that doctors take when examining a patient . They don’t know everything about the human body , but they can still make a pretty accurate diagnosis of your illness . We end up then with a hierarchy of knowledge . Some things that are extremely likely , some things we’re pretty sure of , and some things that we think might be true , but really could go either way . There isn’t a division into things that are completely proven and things which are completely unknown . </s>
Instead , you have a sliding scale of increasing confidence . </s>
Let me give you a few examples . </s>
We’re highly confident that the sun is gon na rise tomorrow , it might not , it might go nova . </s>
But it’s likely that it will happen . </s>
It’s quite likely that you’ll be able to get a cab home from this event , unless it’s raining of course . But , but those two things have different levels of certainty . You’re used to the idea that different kinds of knowledge come with different levels of certainty , and that’s exactly what we’re talking about when we talk about the impacts of climate change . Going back to being climate detectives , we’re certain that carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases and they’ve increased because of human activity . </s>
We’re very confident that the planet has been warming up , and we’re pretty sure that the other things that are going on , changes to the sun , changes to particles in the air , changes to ozone have made some difference but aren’t dominant . The physics tells us that this is a very consistent picture . Our suspects , the greenhouse gases , had both the opportunity and the means to cause this climate change and they’re very likely guilty . And they are increasing faster than ever . </s>
Now , the lawyers get involved . Lawyers are paid to present a certain case regardless of its merits and they do that by challenging everything in the case , and if one argument doesn’t work , well , they’ll just move on to the next . This procedure works very well when the proposition being debated is very binary , a yes , no . Is the subspe- , is the suspect guilty , uh should he go free , should he go to jail ? </s>
It is designed specifically to prevent significant action in the face of uncertainty . </s>
If there is still reasonable doubt , the suspect gets acquitted even if you still think that they did it . But contrast that with the scientists . They want to know the most likely explanation . The lawyers , they want to win the case . </s>
In their own domains both ways of finding out things are very useful , it’s only when they come together in situations like this that things get tricky . </s>
Particularly when scientific results are perceived to have economic or moral implications , it’s common for political debates to get shifted into the scientific arena . It makes the political argument seem much more scientific and therefore logical . </s>
But since the basic disagreement is still political , this is a disaster for any kind of action . So tonight , you’re not gon na hear us arguing about obscure details in climate science , if you have any questions , I have a web site realclimate.org , you can go and check that out and I’ll be happy to answer any questions you might have . </s>
But here we’re gon na talk about the bigger picture . Let me give you a few examples of how that works . Creationists have argued that the eye is too complex to have evolved . </s>
Not because they care about the evolution of eyes , but because they see the implications of evolution as somehow damaging to their world view . If you demonstrate the evolution of eyes , their world view won’t change , they’ll just move onto something else . Another example , when CFCs from aerosol cans and air conditioners were found to be depleting the ozone layer , the CEO of DuPont , the main manufacturer argued that because CFCs were heavier than air , they couldn’t possibly get up to the ozone layer . So there was no need to regulate them , that was pure fantasy , but it sounded scientific . </s>
Again , tobacco companies spent millions trying to show that nicotine delayed the onset of Alzheimer’s because that was a distraction from the far more solid case that , that linked tobacco to lung cancer . That was a distraction and a red herring . These arguments are examples of pseudo debates , scientific sounding points that are designed not to fool the experts , but to sow confusion and doubt in the minds of the lay public . This is a deliberate strategy and you’re hearing it here tonight . So during this debate , let’s play a little game . </s>
I’ll call it spot the fallacy . Every time that you hear the other side claim that we are predicting an imminent catastrophe , give yourself one point . Every time you hear an anecdote used to refute a general trend , that’s cherry picking and we heard that already , uh give yourself another . And every time you hear there’s a lag between carbon dioxide and temperature in the ice cores , give yourself two points because that’s a real doosy . One . </s>
So far this evening we’re running at about two red herrings , two complete errors , three straw men and one cherry pick . So see how you do and we’ll compare notes at the end . Scientists have to be professional skeptics , right , they are trained not to take new information at face value , they have to ask where measurements come from and what they could possibly mean . </s>
They have to be dispassionate about the data , and just see where it leads . Once you start making logically fallacious arguments in order to support a predetermined position , you are no longer acting as a scientist , you are acting as a lawyer , however scientific sounding you might seem . Despite that natural skepticism , the national academies of all eight , G8 countries , all the major scientific societies , even the White House have agreed with a scientific consensus on this matter , which pointedly did not happen in the 1970s by the way . </s>
Michael Crichton for one has frequently stated the consensus….. Gavin Schmidt , thank you very much . Philip Stott , you have the podium next . Brian may I just take one second to thank very much the Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared for having the great courtesy to invite me over from London to participate in this very exciting set of debates . </s>
Thank you also to all my colleagues for their contribution and above all to the audience for I’m sure , gon na be exciting participation as well . I want to start exactly with the consensus word that was used by Richard . Can I just remind you he wanted an example . In the early 20th century , 95 % of scientists believe in eugenics . Science does not progress by consensus , it progresses by falsification and by what we call paradigm shifts . </s>
And in my , riposte I’ll be coming to a paradigm shift that could actually throw the whole of what that other side is saying through the window . </s>
But that 's later . </s>
What I want to come to now is the 1970s that Robert Rosenkranz quite correctly reminded us of . Because then a crisis was announced . And I want to quote from three newspapers . </s>
The Christian Science Monitor , “Warning , Earth’s climate is changing faster than even experts expect.” I really like that . </s>
Your own New York Times , “A major cooling of the climate is widely inevitable.” And in Newsweek , back to consensus , “Meteorologists are almost unanimous that catastrophic famines will result from global cooling.” That was the 1970s . And there are many headlines . And what I would like to stress is , it was a stress on consensus , it was faster than expected , the evidence came from the oceans , from polar bears , it’s always polar bears , from the changing seasons and it’s always disaster . </s>
Why do we believe them now ? And what is important in this I think is to remember what that first Earth Day claimed . </s>
The first Earth Day in America claimed the following , that because of global cooling , the population of America would have collapsed to 22 million by the year 2000 . And of the average calorie intake of the average American would be wait for this , 2,400 calories , would good it were . </s>
It’s nonsense and very dangerous . And what we have fundamentally forgotten is simple primary school science . Climate always changes . It is always as Dick said warming or cooling , it’s never stable . And if it were stable it would actually be interesting scientifically because it would be the first time for four and a half billion years . </s>
Second , humans have been influencing climate for a million years as hominids , from the first hominid that set fire to the Savanna grasslands in Africa , when particulates and gases started to rise and they changed the reflectivity of the surface of the Earth . </s>
It’s a long relationship . So the debate , is climate changing and are humans affecting climate change is actually nearly irrelevant . The answers are yes and yes , and always will be . What is really crucial in all this is something that none of the scientists or none of the politicians want you really to hear . </s>
Climate is the most complex system we know governed by thousands of factors , I haven’t time to list them . But the point is , it’s like in my country , Glasgow on a Saturday night , chaos . And what we’re trying to do is manage it by dealing with one pub . One . And it just won’t work , that’s the danger . </s>
In such a system , doing something at the margins and not doing something in the margins are equally unpredictable . And the question we should be asking our politicians are , what climate are you actually aiming to produce and when we get there won’t it change anyway ? The crisis is therefore in ourselves and if we are rejecting this and I ask you passionately to do so for the next two more important reasons , our uh , political agenda as Michael hinted is wrong . There are two great crises in the world of which the biggest unquestionably is four billion people in poverty . </s>
And this topic is an ecocondria of our rich selves , London , New York and Washington . It’s about us and about our hypochondria about the world . If you actually have clean water , you have modern energy , you will cope with change whatever it is , hot , wet , cold or dry . I’m a left wing critic of global warming because the agenda is fundamentally wrong and dangerous . </s>
And believe you me , neither Republican nor Democrat will do anything about it , because our second crisis is a crisis of hypocrisy . </s>
Now Michael hinted at this , but I come from Europe which has been lecturing the world on this subject . Let me tell you , the hypocrisy in Europe is absolutely mind blowing , I am embarrassed . The latest statistic from the Environment Agency in Europe will predict under the Kyoto Protocol we won’t even be minus , that by 2012 , we’ll be plus four percent . </s>
And did you know that island whom we all love actually under the Kyoto Protocol is allowed a growth of 13 % ? And some of the figures for the , for Europe are just spectacularly worrying . </s>
Spain , Italy , Portugal , we’re in the 40 percentile . And yet we lecture the world . </s>
What we see in this is an enormous danger for politicians in terms of their hypocrisy . I’m not going to say anything about Al Gore and his house . </s>
But it is a very serious point . Global warming is also dangerous because I am an environmentalist , but what I’m beginning to see is that global warming is setting age- , agendas which are actually damaging for the environment . </s>
Bio fuels in which the energy relationships are very dodgy , but which have a very significant effect certainly in my country on biodiversity . What is more , we’re having wind farms placed for global warming on very , very sensitive peatmoor habitats . Don’t think therefore that if you’re an environmentalist , you have to be attached to this agenda . Because it is now overarching , overdominant and is actually taking money and effort away from genuine and real on the ground habitat…… </s>
One . </s>
…..environmental concerns . </s>
But let me end with two images . </s>
Angela Merkel the German chancellor , my own good prime minister for whom I voted let me emphasize , arguing in public two weeks ago as to who in Annie get the gun style could produce the best temperature . </s>
“I could do two degrees C said Angela , ” “No , I could only do three said Tony.” Stand back a minute , those are politicians , telling you that they can control climate to a degree Celsius . This is a political crisis , not a crisis as put here , and I ask you passionately to vote against it . And Samuel Johnson and James Thurber , I have to end with Thurber because of the New Yorker . Samuel Johnson , the great lexicographer talked of a , in Russia last talked to an astronomer who thought he could control the sun and the clouds… . Philip Stott . </s>
….he was mad . Thank you very much . I can’t get Thurber in , thank you . Brenda Ekwurzel , the podium is yours . </s>
I’d like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation , to all of you for taking time to discuss this urgent topic . Uh , Gavin Schmidt , like in the climate scientists to forensics team of the CSI , uh another metaphor that applies is that of a doctor . And studying global warming is like taking the Earth’s temperature . </s>
We’ve seen that it’s rising , and also we have diagnosed the dominant cause of this fever is the heat trapping emissions from human activity . So far temperatures have gone up about over a degree , point , one point four degrees Fahrenheit . </s>
That doesn’t mean much to our everyday lives , but it means everything to the Earth . </s>
All of us have experienced 100 degree temperature , a hundred and two degree temperature , but we’ve survived . Now the body can not withstand 107 degree Fahrenheit temperature . That’s about an eight degree jump above the average body temperature . </s>
Now when it comes to the Earth , the Earth is much more fragile than the body when it comes to temperature . What we see is that a seven degree increase in global warming would mean that we would accelerate , we would intensify the water cycle , that means the wet places will get wetter and the dry places will get drier . </s>
It means we put at risk species that are gon na go extinct . </s>
It means that the summer arctic ice is at risk of disappearing . </s>
It also means that a seven degree rise in temperature would commit us to substantial sea level rise from melting of the Greenland ice sheet . The Earth’s fever is only getting worse and the animals and the plants that are out there struggling are already giving us the early warning signs . We’ve seen them shift their habitats and we’ve seen them struggle as they cope with the shifting of the period , the warm periods and the cold periods of the seasons . Furthermore , there’s already heat in the pipeline as the oceans play catch-up to the atmosphere loading that we’ve put , these heat trapping gases in our atmosphere . </s>
As the oceans warm up , the temperatures will commit us to further warming . We’re locking in another degree of Fahrenheit of warming . </s>
That’s heat in the pipeline . Do we really want to lock in even further warming ? </s>
We’re going to keep studying the symptoms of scie- , as scientists . But the diagnosis is very clear and the course of treatment is even clearer . Choosing not to fight global warming is as foolhardy as ignoring the early warning signs of a fever of a young child and not attending to that . </s>
So what is the course of treatment and can we really do something about it ? </s>
The answer is yes , but we have to act soon , we have to start tackling this problem on all fronts . Our landfills , farms , and livestock are emitting methane and other heat trapping gases . Our fossil fuels , our oil , our coal , our gas , cutting down forests , are committing us to ever increasing levels of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere , in fact , these levels of heat trapping gases are at the highest level than they’ve ever been for hundreds of thousands of years . </s>
It’s not natural . Since the dawn of the industrial age , humans have been digging up carbon and putting it on fire , and using it as energy . </s>
Now the Earth doesn’t normally set on fire million year ol- , million year old stores of carbon , it’s unnatural . It’s not , it’s not a normal thing . What we’re doing by using these fossil fuels is overwhelming the Earth’s capacity to clean up and absorb that carbon dioxide from the atmosphere . The Earth takes hundreds of years to get rid of carbon dioxide and what’s most important , is that this fact is very important to help us decide when we have to start acting about global warming . While some of the worst effects might not be felt for decades or centuries the actions we take today will determine how much carbon dioxide will be in the atmosphere , how much global warming we are locking in , how bad are the effects going to be for ourselves and for our children and grandchildren . </s>
That’s what’s really important . We probably have a decade to institute meaningful solutions . Why ten years ? That’s because the decisions we make today have a long term commitment . </s>
If we do not reform our agriculture practices heat trapping gases will continue to accumulate in the atmosphere . However , if we were to capture methane from our landfills , not only would we stop those emissions from going to the atmosphere , we would also be creating energy at the same time . If we make a building in the old way then we would be polluting for decades to come . However , if we were to build with renewable energy sources new cleaner buildings then that means that we have eliminated that fossil fuel loading of emissions to the atmosphere . </s>
If we construct coal power plants the conventional way that means we are substantially increasing the heat trapping emissions in our atmosphere for fifty years and they will linger for many , many more years . However , if we invest in research and technology to capture carbon from those coal plants this will would be welcome news to all the nations of the world that have deep , vast coal reserves . </s>
Increasing energy efficiency and harnessing renewable energy from the sun , from the wind , from other sources will help us along this path . If our cities continue to grow , that increase the commuting distance of our citizens , that means we are committing ourselves to burning more fuel . There are better ways . With profitable solutions at hand it’s irresponsible to postpone action . </s>
Right now we could put nations on target to reducing emissions . </s>
If we start now we reduce each year . However , if we delay that means that the cuts that we have to make to meet our goals will become steeper and steeper and we may not even be able to meet those demands . They will become too hard for us to reach . It’s the equivalent to the person with a credit card who can no longer pay off the minimum payments , that can not reach their goals . </s>
Right now we’re on a spending spree with our heat trapping emissions . We’re building up the future costs of global warming . And – </s>
One . </s>
And when this bill comes , uh , when the bill for our emissions today comes , comes due in the not too distant future , um , choosing not to fight global warming is about as irresponsible as not making payments on a high interest credit card . With such high stakes common sense requires that we act now and while we still have options . </s>
Um , within the next decade we will continue to determine whether or not our children and grandchildren look back at this time and decide whether we failed them . Or will they look back at this time and see that built a better planet for ourselves and for them ? We have a chance to avert this crisis and to assure a safer planet . And if we wait for the children to solve this problem it’s too late . The risks are too big . </s>
But before we act on the global warming – Brenda Ekwurzel , thank you very much . …we must recognize it for the crisis that it is . </s>
Vote no . And thank all our panelists for their initial presentations . I am now ready to announce the results of the pre- debate vote , rounded to the nearest whole number . </s>
Those for the motion that global warming is not a crisis , were 30 % of you . Those against the motion were 57 % of you , those undecided , were 13 % of you . Not worthy of snickering , those 13 percent . </s>
Or , more precisely , 29.88 % for , 57.32 % against , and 12.8 % undecided . </s>
So we’re now ready to begin the Q-and-A portion of the program , I will call on the questioners , someone on each side of the auditorium will come to you with a microphone when you raise your hands . I will be looking for , from you , challenging questions for the pro side and for the anti side . Uh , if you can identify yourselves that way , uh , to the people with the microphones that would be good . Um , if some of you don’t fit into that category that’s okay too . </s>
Uh , we’re gon na mix in my questions and your questions and to the panelists , um , I hope to keep a good pace here because by the rules we have 20 minutes only , and there is so much to follow up on . Also…audience members , uh , please do not start to ask your question until you have a microphone . please make your questions short and to the point , please , 30 seconds if you can , and , the more focused your question , the more likely you are to be on NPR . So— There you go . Okay . </s>
Brenda Ekwurzel , and Richard Lindzen . </s>
Can I get the two of you to engage for up to two minutes on one thing I noticed in your conversations , in your presentations , um… Richard Lindzen , you seemed to say that warming could make the climate more stable . Brenda , you seemed to suggest , that it would make it less stable . Richard Lindzen , I’ll start with you , and talk to each other . Are you arguing that global warming could be good for the earth ? </s>
Yeah , of course it could be . That’s , uh , goes without question . There’s no reason to assume we’re at the optimum for climate . It’s been all over the place— </s>
But it’s the climate that we have adapted to , it’s the climate that has led us to put— It may be— —Battery Park City right at the waterline , that’s the problem— Gavin Schmidt , thank you , let him , let him— Hang on , hang on , hang on , well— Let him finish your thought , go ahead , Richard Lindzen— What I was referring to was the issue of variability . </s>
And that depends basically on the pole-to-equator temperature difference . And since the models are suggesting that the warming would be greater at the poles , then you are reducing the equator to pole- temperature difference , you’re increasing the—decreasing the forcing for storms , and you’re decreasing the range . Brenda Ekwurzel ? </s>
Yes , I think the risks are gon na grow , we know this with the warming of the planet further . And furthermore , if we have those risks that means that governments are gon na spend much more money , hand over fist , bailing out farmers that are suffering from more extreme draught , we have arable lands growing— Look— —uh , stuff like this— But they’d have less water source— </s>
—this is gon na be—and less money for fighting poverty and all those other aspects that are important— Philip Stott , you wanted to get in here ? </s>
Just to say I did find Gavin’s comment a little amusing because in fact 8,000 years ago , at a peak of warming much higher than today , you know what the climate people call it ? The climate optimum . In other words it’s actually perceived as more optimal in terms of vegetation and other factors . </s>
Not for people who own— Gavin , go ahead and respond . Not for people who own basement property in Battery Park City . A low-lying area of New York City for those of you living… around the country . But I think that raises a really interesting issue because of course adaptation to change is always the way that humans have coped with it , in fact of course bad planning and bad building doesn’t excuse and is not proof of global warming . </s>
Here’s a question for the anti side . A question for the anti side if I might , these 1970s headlines about global cooling . </s>
That always comes up as an inconvenient fact . I’ve almost got a title there . How do you explain that ? Who wants it . </s>
You know , that’s an—that’s the scientific equivalent of an urban legend and I’m shocked , that not— Richard Somerville . That not—not only , uh , did we hear it from Michael Crichton and Philip Stott but we heard it from the fourth member of the pro team , Mr. Rosenkranz , at the beginning . The—there wasn’t a scientific consensus in the ‘70s about global cooling . There was hype in the news media . </s>
Quoting Newsweek is not the right way to evaluate , uh , scientific thought , you can look it up . But , can I—can I answer that ? Wait , Richard Lindzen , go ahead ? Yeah . But , you know , the claim of consensus right now is also not based on a vote…or anything else , and in fact it was invoked by Newsweek in 1988…when they stated all scientists agree . </s>
But wait , on—do you agree on this 1970s global cooling thing , that that was media hype , Richard Lindzen ? Actually , I do not disagree with Richard on that . Thank you— I think it is true that the media amplified what was going on considerably , and that the field itself was in a much healthier state at that time and the open discussions were greater . </s>
Philip Stott , very briefly . Yeah , what’s very amusing was , one scientist came out in 1970 , a Swedish scientist , and actually said we should pump out carbon dioxide to ensure that we didn’t go into global cooling . You know , you—you can always find , uh , people on the fringes— Richard Somerville , go ahead— </s>
You can always find people , uh , on the fringes , consensus doesn’t mean unanimity and science isn’t a democracy anyway but it’s not good to misrepresent , the situation when an overwhelming majority of genuine experts have come to conclusions opposed to some of those who’ve heard , uh , from the other side . So , so to the yes team…Michael Crichton , you talked about , how consensus is sometimes wrong and it takes the individual to burst through the consensus . Excuse me . Um , this debate is set up three on three , as if everything were even . </s>
But in the real world out there , we just had the big inter- governmental panel on climate change report in which 90 % of the world’s governments and 90 % of their atmospheric sciences declared with 90 % certainty , that global warming is real and human beings are causing it . </s>
Why would you three be more credible to the non-scientists in our audience , than all of them ? It—it’s…this is always to me a very fascinating point . </s>
If , if we were to say , um , does the moon revolve around the earth , uh , we would say yes , and no one would ever , would ever preface that by saying , well , the consensus of scientists says this . You know , the , the notion of consensus is only a vote for very particular kinds of things , and to me it’s a serious warning signal . For example , ordinarily if I were to say the moon is full of green cheese , no one would , no one would vilify me or— they would take me out and prove to me that that wasn’t the case . </s>
It’s , it’s when there isn’t a very good and powerful counter-argument , that’s the first answer , the second answer is , is one I really like very much and it’s one Einstein made . He , um…there was a— the Nazis decided that they would , uh , do something to demonstrate that German science was bad and they got 200 , uh , German scientists to say that Einstein was wrong and then somebody asked Einstein , how does it feel to have 200 scientists against you . And he said , it takes only one to prove me wrong . All right , who on the anti side wants to respond . </s>
Uh , Gavin Schmidt . </s>
Okay . </s>
You’ve frequently stated that consensus is not science . And you know what , I agree with you . Consensus is what’s left over , after the science has been done . Consensus is what goes into the textbooks . </s>
The science is happening at the frontiers . It’s the filling in of the interesting pieces of the jigsaw puzzle . It’s the , not—it’s not the overall picture , the big picture , is the stuff that everybody knows and everybody understands . Your , your assessment of— You’re—you’re arguing that , because something is—people agree on it , you can’t possibly agree with it . </s>
It’s like saying , well if you disagree , then I’ll agree . No , I was— You’re saying you’ll never agree which means that you’re not listening to what the people are saying— Yeah— —what am I saying again— </s>
Michael , go ahead , I’m sorry ? I’m not saying that the consensus is necessarily wrong , I’m only saying that consensus is not a—a clear proof that it’s right . And moreover , Michael— Of course not , no— —has made the point— </s>
Richard Lindzen on the same side , go— continue . Lamont made the same statement , you don’t use consensus if you have a proof . What’s very important— </s>
Philip Stott , you wan na back that up further— Yeah , quite , Gavin right , you said , we should always be at the edge , the edge of science on climate change has nothing to do with CO2 , it’s to do with what we call cosmic rays , the relationship to the sun , and water vapor . Anybody else on the anti side wan na come back on that ? </s>
They all three got a—got a lick in there . I—it is— </s>
Richard Somerville— It is mind-boggling , to say that cosmic rays are the cause of , of climate change is to en—endorse one of the least proven , most tentative— I didn’t say that . Oh , good , I’m glad— </s>
But then why—why did you bring it up . Why did you bring it up , yeah— </s>
Simply because there are a whole range of scientists who are working on this particular topic and they say it’s one of the big unknowns and a great deal of research has just been done on it . At the edge— But we’re—we’re talking about global warming , we’re talking about the trend in temperature that— Gavin Schmidt— </s>
—we’ve seen over the last 30 years . </s>
There has been no trend in cosmic rays . </s>
So any change that there might have been because of cosmic ray impacts on climate , can’t possibly have an impact on what’s been going on— The most famous— </s>
—in the last changes . But the most famous astrophysicist working on it say that it has . Uh , he is wrong . Okay— </s>
I’m sorry . We’re now ready to vote—no , I’m kidding . Um , for— That’s a serious accusation against some very serious sci—some are infinitely better than any of us on this platform today . I’d like to meet the person— </s>
Explain that— There are some very eminent scientists , Professor Jan Veizer for example , uh , uh , Nir Sh—Professor Nir Shaviv who won the Young Scientist of the Year in Israel two years ago , who are in fact arguing that 70 % of , of climate change is primarily driven by cosmic rays working through water vapor and clouds . </s>
I’m not saying they’re right or wrong , they’re pointing however at the edge , to new research . You can not dismiss that , because it’s a consensus for CO2 . Gavin Schmidt , one more time ? Okay , this is exactly what I was talking about . </s>
You see ? </s>
Now , it looks like we’re having a scientific argument , but , this is completely bogus . You don’t know that it’s bogus , but I know that it’s bogus , he knows that it’s bogus . You’re being led astray . You’ll forgive me , Gavin… If—if you seriously wish to maintain that , then you’d better explain why— </s>
Richard Lindzen— —between you and Richard , you’ve made statements that are overtly untrue . </s>
And I’ll give you some . You say , the earth has been warmer—is warmer now than it has been for 1300 years . The national academy evaluating this said , the methodology was no use beyond 400 years . Why do you make this statement . </s>
You keep on quoting these groups , and when they disagree with them , you make up the quote . I—I’ve got ta say that one , one thing at a time— </s>
Gavin Schmidt— —let’s deal with that . The National Academy of Science report said that we have good evidence that we’re warmer from 400 years ago , we have credible evidence that we’re warmer from 900— No , they did not— </s>
Yes they did , Richard , please— No , the— Read the reports before— </s>
—front end—the front end said— </s>
Read the—read more than the front page , Richard— No , I’m saying the text , said it was not credible beyond 400 years— That’s not what it—that’s not what it said— Moreover , moreover— Right , well , wait , wait , wait , wait , wait— </s>
I can tell you why it’s not— We’re into “he said”-“he said.” But— But Gavin Schmidt , you seem to suggest that the other side does not have a real scientific argument , but a culturally or politically constructed one . You don’t think they’re sincere ? </s>
That’s a very difficult question . I think—I— no , I , I do think that they’re sincere— </s>
You as much as said it . </s>
I don’t think that they are completely…doing this on a level playing field that the people here will understand . </s>
And , there are… </s>
Well… explain yourself , because—wait a minute— No , let me—let me explain , explain that— Because they have larger cultural or political agendas ? No , um , I have no idea what their political or cultural agendas are , and to be frank I’m not very interested . </s>
I’m left-wing and have no money whatsoever from any oil company— </s>
Okay , and— </s>
—and I wouldn’t . </s>
That’s fine . </s>
That’s fine . </s>
But I’m , I’m— </s>
All right— —I’m not interested in your motivations— But I know— </s>
All right— — has interests . Let’s go to the audience , and , when you ask your questions , uh , members of the press , please identify yourselves as such . </s>
Members of the audience who are not with the press , you have the option to identify yourself , or not . Okay . </s>
Right down here . Hi , my name is Linda Caro , um , it kind of surprises me that , uh , the emphasis is on CO2 which is about one-third of 1 % of the total atmosphere , whereas global—uh , water vapor is the vast bulk of it all . Uh , is it possible that we are , um…are not accounting properly for , uh , the giving off of heat such as nuclear power plants which are several thousand degrees Centi—uh , Fahrenheit , that we’re cooling with water and air , every day , every week , every month , every year , that can’t— </s>
Is there anyone you would particularly like to answer that question ? Whoever feels most qualified . </s>
Richard Somerville is raising his hand . </s>
The , the direct heating from sources like power plants is negligible , uh , compared to these , these other factors , solar radiation , greenhouse effect . And the greenhouse effect is due to water vapor , primarily carbon dioxide and other gas is secondary , we can’t control water vapors . It’s controlled by the atmosphere itself , largely by temperature , so when you add CO2 , you humidify the atmosphere and the water adds to the warming . That’s one reason why Richard Lindzen’s talking about CO2 only giving you a degree or so is disingenuous because that feedback is expected theoretically and has been observed . </s>
I think Richard Stott is , uh—Philip Stott is bursting out of his chair to agree with you . I could not agree more . Yes , it’s governed by the atmosphere . Absolutely , and is not under our control . </s>
But it’s— It is therefore one of the big factors , that we have no control over . It’s— </s>
In a non-linear couple system . I’m , I’m , I’m stunned by , by your amazement that non-linear coupled chaotic systems are things that we can’t understand even in part , that— </s>
He didn’t say that— I said—I said control . </s>
Very—very good . You can control how much CO2 you put in the atmosphere and that will have a big effect on how much water vapor is in the atmosphere , that’s not controversial . </s>
Well you can’t predict— That is controversial— </s>
Yeah . —and it’s controversial because it is not a homogeneous distribution of water vapor . Yeah , exactly . And , you know , to pretend this is settled , is bizarre . Moreover with clouds , which are comparably important , you know full well , that that is not settled . </s>
Let us— By a long shot . </s>
—go to another questioner from the audience— </s>
Down on this side in the front . Uh , Andy Revkin from the New York Times , this is , this is kind of neat to , to listen to . </s>
Did I hear a hiss ? Ssss . </s>
Back atcha . Um , I’ve been writing about this for a long time . Uh , most every aspect of it . So my question is , uh , one about the hedging , managing risk came up before , which is not what you think of when you think of crisis and catastrophe . My—my sense is that there’s one thing that everyone has agreed on , at least—except maybe Philip , which is that , more greenhouse gases will make the world warmer . </s>
Is there anyone other than Philip who disagrees with that— I don’t disagree with it . Okay , you did it—yeah , so , we all—I love to find the things we agree on . </s>
Um , so everyone agrees , more greenhouse gases will make the world warmer . Uh , the doubling is , is a step on the staircase we’re—we’re heading on toward tripling or quadrupling , I think everyone would mostly agree that if we go to nine billion people , all of whom would love to have our level of affluence , we’re going in that direction . And so , as a hedging exercise , if it weren’t costly to slow the pace , beyond the Jesse Ausubel very slow decarbonization , if we could find a new way that didn’t cost a lot , that actually could give energy for those developing countries that crave it , and limit emissions at the same time , would anyone on the pro side think that it’s a bad idea to stop emitting greenhouse gases , if there were a solution . Michael Crichton , you’re shaking your head no ? </s>
No— </s>
As a hedge— —no , I don’t think anybody objects , uh , the , the , the question is whether or not you’re gon na spend what Bjorn Lomberg thinks which is $ 558 trillion and I think , if in fact it’s going to prove to be that kind of enormous construction project , then that should not be the first priority right this minute . But no , I don’t— </s>
So let me pursue Andy Revkin’s stab at striking a consensus on what to do . For the anti side…if this is a crisis , what kind of lifestyle change , what kind of economic pain , and how quickly are you proposing…to hedge our bets ? ASAP— Brenda Ekwurzel . As soon as possible because— </s>
But what ? Everything , everything that we can throw at solving this climate crisis—well , this climate problem , is important because , every day that we emit carbon dioxide means that it will last for many , many centuries , and so we have to start weaning ourselves off of ways of emitting more methane , more nitrous oxide , all the heat- trapping gases , not just carbon dioxide , it’s the ones that have long life , nitrous oxide , carbon dioxide , that are very , very important , in the short term methane is very important ‘cause it has such heat-trapping potential . But forgive me— And so , landfills— </s>
—but the question from— —everything , uh— The—the question from the audience was , things that we could do , correct me if I’m wrong , Andrew , things that we could do without much pain that would stave this off— Well— Either you’re talking about— </s>
Well , what— —revolution , anything necessary . The real problem is— Philip Stott— </s>
—there’s no social discounting in this , let’s get a bit of economics in . So in fact , if you—if you have an increase now , and you take inflation into account , what you’re doing is an average world , um , income at the moment of $ 7,500 . Predicted by a—a distance ahead , that will rise to about $ 88,000 , you knock off what in fact the Stern Report in Britain estimated , as in fact the cost of global warming , 13.27 or so percent , it comes down to something like , uh , 70-something thousand dollars but even taking inflation account , that is still a massive increase in wealth so what you’re actually asking in economic terms , is what is strange but a poorer generation to sacrifice a great deal for what will in any case , even with global warming cares , be a wealthier generation . The thing is that companies right now when they reduce heat- trapping emissions they find profits that keep giving back to them because , right now we’re so wealthy in many nations of the world that we are wasting energy because we can afford to . </s>
And the reality is many companies are saving lots of money when they make small investments to reduce their emissions , DuPont did 50 million to invest , they’re getting 2 billion on return on that investment , and it keeps on giving , so , it’s not an economic…argument . Anything else from the anti side that you think might be… MAN The , the— —consensus , uh , good for us anyway kind of measures that they might agree to ? </s>
Right . Energy conservation— </s>
Gavin Schmidt . Everybody is gon na agree that energy conservation is a good thing and it should be encouraged . Um , right . That’s three heads nodding on this side ? Yeah . </s>
You’re gon na argue with energy conservation— Two—all right , two , two and a half . Two and a half heads , that’s good enough . Go—go on , Richard Somerville . You know , a lot of things could be done , once you free up the creativity of , uh , of technical people , of business people by making this a priority nationally and internationally , the problem isn’t that there’s nothing that can be done , the problem is that , the people who are asking for your vote haven’t heard loudly enough that this is an important issue to the electorate , so it’s way down on people’s priorities , that’s the reason for the lip service that Michael Crichton talked about , people are a lot like , like Mark Twain , they’re all for progress but are opposed to change . </s>
Let’s go— Let’s go back to the audience , someone on this side , do we have someone lined up on that side ? Okay . </s>
Thank you , my name is Heather Higgins , I’m not a scientist , so , pardon my ignorance when I hear the scientistic—scientific establishment believes in something I immediately think of flat- earth consensus , and the fact that there’s no geography that should be admitted as science and that women are all hysterics and ought to be bled . Uh , so , uh , that , um , assurance that the scientific community believes something does not take me very far . </s>
My question is address particularly to Brenda , as well as to anyone else . Um , I was fascinated by your statement that the earth is more fragile than human beings are . Uh , I am not a scientist so maybe you can explain to me how we managed to get through the Ice Age and the Middle Ages when Greenland was actually green and people were a foot taller and there was farming there , uh , and nobody was digging up coal to warm the earth . Um , and , I’m curious as to why you think that this is an optimal period of climate , uh , certainly for far less money we could move everybody out of Battery Park City . </s>
And I am curious , if you believe that CO2 is actually the , the—the particular problem is actually the issue , the degree to which you are willing to , to become like France , where instead of having 20 % of their power from nuclear , they have 86 % . When there was a natural ice age before and when we were coming out of that ice age there weren’t millions of people , 80 % of our population living on the coasts with their high-dollar homes or , maybe fragile homes , not such high-dollar homes . There are many people living in Bangladesh that are squeezed between sea- level rise and the melting of the , the Himalayas and flooding from the land side . And so , we are talking about the fragility of humans adapting to this rapid change , as well as , when— In the past , sea-level rise , you could have , for example , wetlands marching up onto land , and moving inland and adapting and dunes moving inland , right now we have all our infrastructure in its place , and you can see , Miami is stranded out there , Atlantic City is stranded out there , we spend many of— millions of dollars dredging , and , and keeping these unsustainable systems that are not able to adapt naturally anymore because we’re in the way . And we also are gon na suffer , if we don’t , uh , make action . </s>
Philip Stott , you get 20 seconds to respond— Yeah , it was a , I think a brilliant question that , because the earth is as tough as an old boot . </s>
If there is any fragility it’s in us and that’s what we’re concerned about , the earth will survive whether we’re here or not or whether there’s global warming or not— Question on this side ? Hi , Van Greenfield , just following up a little bit on the , uh…question two minutes ago on what we could do , um… Philip , you had said in another article , “My own instinct is that our ability to change reflectivity on the earth’s surface will in the end prove to have been far more important.” In terms of the concept of reflectivity could you expand on that and its possible…less expensive method for dealing with this ? </s>
Very briefly , please . Very briefly , but it’s a very important point , the point is very simple , that humans are not just doing CO2 , we do many factors , and the way we have altered the albedo as we call it , the surface reflectivity of the earth , uh , particularly I may add since the Neolithic revolution in agriculture has had probably quite a significant effect . </s>
However , we can’t model it very well . </s>
And the problem is it’s one of those big gaps like many others things in the models that we’re talking—and that is a human factor . So in other words I agree with that , exactly how we cope with it though is another issue , because we know so little about it . </s>
And can I remind everybody that IPCC that we keep talking about , very honestly admits that we know very little about 80 % of the factors behind climate change . One more thing for the anti side…bef—oh , you wanna—okay , go ahead and give a quick response to that , 20-second response ? Go— </s>
Uh , what is 80 % — Gavin , Gavin Schmidt— —of the counter-factors even mean . </s>
If you look at , if you look at the radiative forcing from carbon dioxide , from methane , from nitrous oxide , from CFC’s , from tropospheric ozone , from stratospheric ozone , from land-use change , from aerosols , from black soo—from black soot’s pa—um , impacts on , um , snow albedo , you know…all of those , all of those things , we know some of them very well , we know some of them less well . But to , to , to claim that we don’t know anything about 80 % of them , is , it’s , it’s a meaningless statistic— Yeah , I’d like to—could I chime in there just for a moment , Brian— Richard Somerville , also 20 seconds— Listen , it’s , it’s fun to hear other people practicing meteorology without a license , so , and you know— This , this field is like all fields of science , you know , medical science is incomplete and has uncertainties too . </s>
But it’s good enough to be useful . You don’t dismiss your doctor’s advice , because she hasn’t solved all the diseases . And I think the same is true of climate science today . Philip Stott— Don’t dismiss it— </s>
—one—one retort . Well let’s use an engineer , I don’t think I’d want to cross Brooklyn Bridge if it were built by an engineer who only understood 80 % of the forces on that bridge . There’s one thing… I—I actually— That— </s>
—I , we , we…I think we might have a solution to the energy crisis , we just need to tap Philip Stott . There is one thing that I think we need to get to before we wrap up . For the anti side…they say…the real crises today include poverty , dirty water , and a lack of modern energy supply to 4 billion poor people on earth . So if this is a crisis , how do you prioritize it , compared to those other things , and assuming that it takes tremendous amounts of resources to solve any of them . You know , I—I can not imagine why Philip Stott and Michael Crichton seem to think that doing something about these terrible crises is impossible if you do something about climate change , or even made more difficult , climate change need not be in competition with or be an alternative to doing something about the terrible toll that poverty and preventable disease take . </s>
We can do both of those and many other worthy things as well , in fact , it’s exactly the poorest and most vulnerable people on the planet who will suffer the most from the consequences of , of global warming which goes on unabated . Michael Crichton ? You know , uh , I’m really fascinated at the number of newspaper headlines and articles that I see about global poverty and the , and the difficulties of people in Africa as compared to the headlines about , about global warming , and , um , uh , of course Richard it’s very true that we can do two things at the same time , it—the , the reality is that we don’t . And the reality is , that , we are failing and have continuously failed to address the issues of the third world even though , everyone knows that if you were to , to look at it for bangs for the buck , if you were to look at it from a humanitarian standpoint , if you were to look at it from the easiest way to do the most for environmental degradation as it’s created around the world , you would address global poverty . </s>
But we’re not . </s>
We’re talking as we’re talking tonight , we’re all getting very heated about something that may or may not happen 100 years from now . And while we’re doing , 3,000 , 5,000 , 10,000 people are dead . </s>
That concludes… the discussion portion of our program . And it is now time to vote . If you wan na vote for the motion , tear off “For” from the top…of the motion , uh , ballot , and slip into the ballot boxes… This is a ballot box , that will be passed among you . If you are against the motion , tear off and deposit “Against” into the ballot box , and if you still don’t know where you stand…put your entire ticket into the box . </s>
The ballot boxes will be given to the person at one end of a row , please pass the ballot box to your neighbor until it reaches the end of the row , pass it down just like in third grade . One of the ushers will then take the box to the next row , everyone will get a chance to vote so please don’t reach over your neighbor , wait for a ballot box to be passed to you . If you need a voting ticket , the ushers will give you one , just ask . No voter fraud , please . </s>
Okay . Now , here’s the deal . While you’re voting , we will have the closing remarks , two minutes , from each presenter , so we ask for your silence while they finish up , and then of course we will read the results of your voting . </s>
So now the final remarks from the panelists , beginning with the side opposing the motion , panelists , please stay in your seats this time around , we begin with Richard Somerville . You know , the , the fossil fuel age will surely end , sooner rather than later I hope if we’re wise . </s>
Sheikh Yamani , the Saudi oil minister was fond of saying “The Stone Age did not end because we ran out of stones.” And continuing to generate 80 % of the world’s energy from fossil fuel and using the atmosphere as a free dump for waste products , will ultimately produce a damaged planet . We’ve heard a lot of chatter about decarbonization this evening , the fact is that carbon dioxide emissions in the US and globally are going up , not down . </s>
Sherwood Rowland , later a Nobel laureate , was a frustrated person in 1984 , because humanity was so slow in dealing with the issue of ozone depletion . </s>
He said , quote , “After all , what’s the use of having developed a science well enough to make predictions , if in the end , all we’re willing to do is stand around and wait for them to come true.” Roland’s remark is apt for our topic tonight . </s>
As in the case of ozone loss , so with global warming , once again , powerful technology , in this case abundant cheap fossil— One— —fuel energy , with unanticipated side effects , has brought us a Faustian bargain . Once again , the world finds itself at a point where difficult decisions must be made . </s>
That’s the definition of a crisis . </s>
Nothing to do with alarmism or catastrophe . Once again doing nothing or too little will lead to dire consequences . Belittling the science , attacking the scientists , impugning their integrity and , and competence and motivations , refusing to recognize what we have learned about climate change in the vain and naïve hope that the problem will somehow solve itself is irresponsible . Action is needed , meaningful action , soon . Global warming is a crisis . </s>
Thank you . I hope you voted against . Philip Stott , your closing statement . May I say that the last thing I want to do is to demean any scientist . The whole point about science is that it is a constant debate . </s>
And actually , what has worried me deeply about this is not the demeaning of scientists but the attempt to close down the debate , and actually take it away from science . If I may use a musical analogy , my other great interest , trying to reconstruct the climates of the moment as we’re talking about is a bit like trying to play Mozart’s wonderful Symphonia Concertante 364 , when you’ve no viola part and only a quarter of the violin part . </s>
In other words we know remarkably little about so much of the climate that , that we are facing . And , what I would like to stress is , it—it’s a debate on the crisis . We’ve mentioned the crisis of poverty , and I think the crisis of hypocrisy . </s>
Actually where I think we probably agree entirely as a panel , what there really is in the world , there’s not a crisis of climate , a crisis of energy . That is certainly true in my country . </s>
And I’ll tell you what worries me particularly about attaching it to climate . One . In the world , there are groups , including some very reputable groups in Denmark and in Russia and in other countries , which are predicting actually that we will enter a global cooling phase between 2012 and 2015 . Now , I no more necessarily believe that than I do about the global warming . But just supposing that happens , and just supposing what the public reaction is to the hype that there has been about global warming , I actually think that we have to face up to a genuine energy issue in the world , and that most of our politicians are not doing that , in fact they’re dressing it up in this idea of global warming and saving the world , and what we desperately need are very practical decisions about energy , on the ground . </s>
And I think the idea of using the climate to do this is potentially a very dangerous one . So , what I am worried about is that everybody is now using the global con— global warming construction for their own agendas . From capitalist carbon trading , right the way to making you wear hemp underpants . </s>
I distrust that because in the end— </s>
Philip Stott— </s>
—it’s an ism— —thank you very much— —and I distrust isms . </s>
Gavin Schmidt , your closing statement . Hemp underpants , ugh . Climate change is not a new issue . </s>
Even human-cause climate change is not new . Richard Lindzen was arguing these same points 15 years ago , Michael Crichton is recycling talking points that are decades old . Philip Stott is grasping at extremely flimsy straws . Serious scientists in the 1960s made predictions for what would be found if human emissions of greenhouse gases were to continue . They said the planet would warm . </s>
It has . They said the water vapor measurements would show rises . They do . </s>
They said that hos— ocean heat content would rise . It has . They said the stratosphere would cool . It did . If I had time I could go on listing the number of challenges this basic idea has faced and come through . </s>
But you only need to know that it is still standing , and that there are no coherent theories that fit the observations better . </s>
Given that understanding , and the ever-increasing emissions that we are putting into the air , to deny this is a crisis on a planetary scale is truly to fiddle while home burns . One . I’m done . That’s it ? </s>
Richard Lindzen , your closing statement . </s>
Yes . </s>
I think it’s a little bit difficult to know how to respond , to be told that , uh , one shouldn’t attack scientists while you’re attacking scientists , to go and say you have to control methane without explaining that methane has stopped growing . You don’t explain why there’s global warming on Mars , Jupiter , Triton and Pluto . </s>
You don’t look at the ocean data and see , that whereas your boss Jim Hansen was saying that the heating of the ocean proved the flux that he needed for high sensitivity , that in the last year there’ve been two papers in the same journal , that point out that the original Levitus data’s wrong , that the ocean is cool , and that the new numbers would call for one-tenth the sensitivity that Hansen mentioned . If all this is so certain , why is the data changing , or is it a case when the data changes you ignore it , and— One— —stick to the point . You have a minute , do you want the other minute ? </s>
You have a minute—no ? Uh , okay . </s>
Brenda Ekwurzel , your closing statement . Global warming is here today and is accelerating . Many business leaders are already realizing that it makes economic sense to start fighting global warming . Wal-Mart , DuPont , BP , General Electric , they all are asking for action . </s>
And , businesses need a clear signal from the national level . Because they want to have a level playing field , and , they want to plan for the future . </s>
And that’s what makes good business sense . We need a national policy because people , cities and states can not reduce global warming enough to make a significant dent in this issue . Ultimately the atmosphere is gon na register all of our choices from today onward . We must act now because if we leave it to our children , the risk will be too great and it will be too late . Fortunately there already exist solutions , all we—we need now is the will to implement them rapidly . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Michael Crichton , your closing statement . There was a time when I worked in a clinic and , uh , one day a young woman came in , she was in her early twenties for a routine checkup and , I said what’s going on with you and she said I’ve just become blind . </s>
And , I said , oh my gosh , really , when did it happen , she said , well just , uh , coming into the clinic , walking up the steps of the clinic I became blind . And I said , oh , and I’m—by now I’m looking through the chart and I said , well , has this happened before , she said yes , it’s happened before . I’ve become blind in the past , and , what she had of course was hysterical blindness . </s>
And the characteristic of that , is that , the severity of the symptom is not matched by the emotional response that’s , that’s being presented . Most people would be screaming about that but she was very calm , oh yes , I’m blind again . And I’m reminded of that whenever I hear , that we’re facing , whether we wan na call it a crisis or not , a significant global event , of , of , of importance where we’re gon na have species lost and so on and so forth— </s>
One— —that we can really address this by changing our light bulbs . Or that we can really make an impact by unplugging our appliances when we’re not using them . </s>
It’s very much out of whack . And so if…if it were only gon na do symbolic actions , I would like to suggest a few symbolic actions that right—might really mean something . One of them , which is very simple , 99 % of the American population doesn’t care , is ban private jets . Nobody needs to fly in them , ban them now . And , and in addition , let’s have the NRDC , the , the Sierra Club and Greenpeace make it a rule that all of their , all of their members , can not fly on private jets , they must get their houses off the grid , they must live in the way that they’re telling everyone else to live . </s>
And if they won’t do that , why should we . And why should we take them seriously . I wan na thank the debaters… and the audience for all your good work . Before I announce the results of the audience vote I wan na take care of a few little things . </s>
First , the next Intelligence Squared US debate will take place on Wednesday , April 18th , here at the Asia Society and Museum . </s>
The motion to be debated is , “Better more domestic surveillance than another 9/11.” The remaining two debates in this spring series including that one are all sold out . </s>
The good news is that packages are available on-line and by phone for the Fall 2007-Spring 2008 series . </s>
Priority will be given to full-season subscribers , so avoid disappointment and buy those series packages now . Tonight’s debate can be heard locally on WNYC AM 820 , on Friday , March 23rd at 2 p.m . You can also purchase DVD’s from previous debates upstairs in the lobby or on the Intelligence Squared US website . Finally , please be sure to pick up a copy of the Times Literary Supplement—are those actually available , there was some question about that . </s>
Is that a—yes , yes , they are available , uh , as you leave the auditorium , and in a minute you can all go home and watch the “American Idol” results show . And now the results of our debate . After our debaters did their best to sway you…you went from , 30 % for the motion that global warming is not a crisis , from 30 % to 46 % . Against the motion , went from 57 % to 42 % … And “undecided” went from 13 % to 12 % . </s>
The hardcore ambivalent are still among us . So , in terms of opinion change , those in favor of the motion , have carried the day , congratulations to the team for the motion . And thank you all again very much , good night . Hello , everyone . </s>
Welcome to our fourth Intelligence Squared US debate of the season , I’m John Donvan , your moderator , and I just want to give you a preliminary introduction . We’ll be doing a more formal introduction once the program begins… At this point our debaters and panelists are coming to the stage , I’d just like to welcome them with a round of applause . And I would further like to introduce the CEO of Intelligence Squared US , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Greetings , welcome , thanks for being here . As is typical on these occasions I try to frame the evening’s debate . And when you think about Google , I mean here’s a company that was founded by two Stanford University graduate students just about 10 years ago . </s>
One of them was an immigrant to this country . They’ve created among them an enterprise that is basically the first place that almost everybody goes for information about anything , it’s an extraordinary achievement . They’ve completely revolutionized the advertising industry by enabling advertisers to very efficiently reach the individuals they want to reach that are interested in their products… and it’s the amounts— the sums that are paid by the advertisers that make these services possible for everybody else as well as having created enormous fortunes for the founders of the company and their shareholders . </s>
They’ve created a unique corporate culture , a corporate culture that is highly entrepreneurial , very inventive , embraces change , I mean it’s an American dream kind of company . So , what’s the debate , where’s the other side of this equation . It comes in a number of categories , the first I would say is privacy . </s>
Google is so ubiquitous , if you put your telephone number in that little box , it comes up with your name and address . If you put your address in Google maps , it can show you a photograph of people going in and out of your building . If you’ve ever made a political contribution , it’s on Google . Virtually every detail of anything you’ve ever published , everything that’s ever been in print about you is part of a permanent record that can be accessed on Google . So , this sense of pervasiveness , the sense that Google knows so much about all of us , is worrisome to people , and with good reason . </s>
And then there are other issues involving personal freedom and you see that mostly in China , at least in terms of the news , where Google has been cooperating with the Chinese government in censorship of the Internet and maybe in other ways that we don’t know about , so we think this is a motion where there’s a lot to be said on both sides , we have an outstanding panel , and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over to John Donvan . Thank you , Robert , may I invite one more round of applause for Mr. Rosenkranz . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to an Intelligence Squared US , Oxford-style debating , live from the Caspary Auditorium at the Rockefeller University . The motion before us tonight is , “Google Violates it’s ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto.” We will be hearing from two teams of three panelists each in debate . </s>
This debate will take place in three parts . There will be opening statements , followed by a round of direct debate among the panelists and that will also include questions from you the audience , and then we will have a brief period of summing up by each of the debaters . In the opening round they are each given seven minutes , and we will have a warning sound for each panelist as they approach minute six…it will sound like this— Clear ? And at seven minutes , if the speaker has not finished speaking , it will sound like this . </s>
And on , and on… and on it will go . This is a contest , it’s a contest of wit and logic and ideas and persuasion , and you the audience are the prize in that contest , you are the judges and your votes will determine who is the winner of the evening , and to that end we’re asking all of you at this point , to express your point of view on the motion now , before having heard any of the actual debate and argument . You each have the keypad at your seat , if you agree with the motion that “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto , ” press button number 1 , if you disagree press button number 2 , and if you are undecided , press button number 3 . I’ll be sharing those results in a short time after we hear the opening round completed . Is everybody— Anybody need more time ? All right . </s>
Restating once again…this Intelligence Squared US debate , our fourth debate in the series , the premise is , the motion is that “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto , ” and you may have noticed that Google itself is not represented on our panel tonight , suffice to say that , the company was made aware of this debate , and was invited to participate . Now , let’s let the debating begin , we’re going first to argue for the motion , Randal Picker , a professor of commercial law at the University of Chicago Law School , and a senior fellow at the Computation Institute of the University of Chicago , ladies and gentlemen , Randal Picker . </s>
Thank you very much . I want to thank Intelligence Squared and the Rosenkranz Foundation for organizing what I think will be a fun and lively evening . So , the resolution before us is that “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto , ” I think it’s important for us to frame that and understand what that means and what it doesn’t mean . </s>
The question isn’t whether Google is a great company . I think it is . </s>
I thought what Bob Rosenkranz said about it is exactly right , much to admire . The question isn’t whether Google does more good than evil . I think it does . That’s not the question either . The question’s whether we can identify certain things which they do which we think are important to how Google operates , that are inconsistent with that motto . </s>
And I think we can . </s>
So we should start where that motto comes from . When Google was going to become a public company it filed its registration statement , if you haven’t read those , they’re remarkably dull . </s>
Not Google’s . Google opens with an owner’s manual for future Google shareholders . Page and Brin say , we’re not an ordinary company , we’re not gon na be an ordinary company . Get ready for the ride . Okay . </s>
Part of that is Google says , we’re gon na live by a motto , and that model is , is we’re not gon na be evil . </s>
Seemingly asking us to hold Google to a higher standard , they’re very clear . There’ll be times when they will sacrifice the short- run interests of Google for the public good . I don’t think what’s legal is the standard to evaluate for Google , Google asks us for something much more public-interested . </s>
Google then compares itself to newspapers . </s>
Well that’s interesting , right , they seem to be on diverging paths but I think they thought there was some sense of a public trust associated with newspapers , and we should hold Google to that as well . That’s what we’re gon na try to do tonight . My piece of this is I’m going to focus on the heart of Google’s business which is their advertising model . And I’m going to focus on the recent deal that was proposed between Google and Yahoo , where Yahoo was going to out-source a large chunk of its search-ad business to Google . </s>
I should say I consulted in connection with the opposition , so you can discount what I say as you wish . I should say we won , that’s good news , because that deal has gone away , the Department of Justice suggested that they were going to challenge the deal in court…that was something clearly Google didn’t want so they backed away from it . </s>
All right . </s>
Advertisers were opposed to the deal . Why were advertisers opposed . Advertisers believed that the deal and the core of the deal was if you think of search queries , there’s a lot of common queries , there’s a lot of unusual queries . The deal is going to out-source the long tail as it were , Chris Anderson’s term of queries , away from Yahoo to Google . Advertisers were upset about that . </s>
Why . </s>
Well , advertisers believed that prices were going to go up because of that . </s>
Google’s response to that was to say…we run auctions . We don’t set prices . </s>
Advertisers set prices . We’re just middlemen . That’s not right , and I think Google knows better . I should say , I’m a Google Ad Words advertiser , so if you’ve not looked at the system , the way it works , you can set an account up very easily , pay five dollars to do so… I’m advertising , I thought I should understand how Ad Words works , so I’m advertising a paper that I wrote on anti-trust and privacy and cloud computing . I’m not sure who the second click has been , um— Okay . </s>
But you see how that works . You can click , and go . But the nature of this is that you bid on keyword terms , if you win the auction your ads are supposed to show up . Now Google understands that how you design auctions matters , there’s a whole field of economics devoted to that . </s>
They gave William Vickery from Columbia a Nobel Prize for that . Google is designing its auctions in a way that takes advantage of its market power . Does that in three important ways . First , Google runs a system involving minimum bids . </s>
So cloud neutrality is one of the terms that I’m bidding on . </s>
You can run a search on cloud neutrality , I did yesterday . I know my ad is out there . </s>
It didn’t show up , indeed no ads showed up , and indeed if you look at the statistics , 50 percent of the time when you run a search on Google , and they produce results , the organic search results , there are no ads next to it . Even though if you believe the comments , and as I say I’m one of these Ad Words ad—Ad Words advertisers , my ad is out there waiting to be served and even though the search that has been done , if they don’t run an ad it’s an opportunity to show an ad which is lost forever . So there was a chance for Google to get money there and yet they’re not doing it . Why , because if very few people are bidding then I ought to be able to buy it for a very low price and Google’s interest is not served by that . Google wants to make sure that there’s a high enough minimum , they’ve been raising the minimums over time , such that Google meaningfully makes money on that . </s>
If you look at the blogs , people comment on this , they talk about bidding against the house , that’s what they have to do . And Google has changed the terms in which they do that . Okay ? That’s an exercise in market power . I should say under current US anti-trust law one of the things I do for a living , I don’t think that’s illegal . </s>
Evil ? Well , that’s the resolution for the house tonight . That’s one . </s>
Two . </s>
If you’re an auctioneer , the way you exercise market power , is you control the number of slots . Right , you don’t control prices , you control quantities . In Google’s case that means how many slots are available on the right-and side next to the organic search results . Google controls that . </s>
Now you might think in a competitive model that we’d have some relationship between the number of ads on Yahoo and the number of ads on Google . Indeed the central premise of the Yahoo-Google deal was that Google does a better job of ad matching than Yahoo does . We should therefore expect Google to have more ads than Yahoo , just the opposite . Again , market power being exercised , not illegal , evil , you decide . </s>
Finally , third point . Google engages in a kind of bundling , so Google also organizes search for Ask and AOL . </s>
You can buy Google alone , you can’t buy Ask and AOL alone . They are bundled together with Google . Right , advertisers would like to be able to advertise separately on those . Can’t do it , they won’t let you do that . Illegal under US law , EU law ? </s>
Maybe , we’ll see . Right ? </s>
Evil , mmm , I think you can conclude . Now , why should we care about this . The importance of advertising is the way that advertising supports paid content . Right ? </s>
You should care a lot about the kind of content that’s out there , and to the extent that the middleman is making it more expensive for people to reach consumers , we’re going to have less content because producers are effectively going to get a lower chunk of the advertising dollars . I’ll stop there , thank you . Thank you , Randy Picker . </s>
Our next speaker speaking against the motion in this US Intelligence Squared debate , Jim Harper , who…though arguing on this side is not somebody unconcerned about privacy , in fact when he was a consultant for the Department of Homeland Security he argued vociferously against the introduction of a national identity card on privacy grounds , as director of Information Policy Studios at the Cato Institute , he is our second speaker , speaking against the motion that “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto.” Jim Harper . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , it takes a lawyer to know a lawyer . And as a lawyer I want to point out what my colleague just did at the beginning of his talk , he redefined the question . The question tonight is whether “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto.” The question is whether Google is evil or not . </s>
And that’s what I want to talk to you about , and I want to urge you to vote no on the resolution . To find that Google is evil , you have to find that people who cut in line are evil . You have to find that , bruised apples are evil . </s>
You have to find that flat tires are evil . These things are not evil . Evil is Hitler . </s>
Evil is Stalin . </s>
Evil is Pol Pot . Evil is…Dr . </s>
Evil . That’s somewhat definitional . </s>
Google is not evil . Now you have to make some sense of the term to understand these concepts , now ... perhaps that phrase was intended in a sort of , “Let’s not be a greasy corporation” sense . Even by that standard , Google is not evil , Google is great . Google brings information and empowerment to the masses in ways we couldn’t have imagined just a few years ago . </s>
Try it now . Think about how you would you have found out information just a few years ago . It’s a little hard to remember for oldsters like me , but it was very hard . </s>
Today it’s much easier . Now there are lots of complaints about Google . Holders of copyrights , say Google’s making use of my copyrights and my property and da- da . In fact Google’s making that material more available and more valuable for copyright holders . Holders of trademarks complain precisely because Google is using trademarks in an appropriate way , in Ad Sense , allowing providers to compare their products with other products , bringing consumers lower prices , better products… This is good , this is not evil . </s>
Now surely Google should avoid censorship . And one of the toughest areas is the question of censorship . But the Chinese people are better off , with Google in China , slow-wokking their cooperation with the Chinese government , than having no Google in China , and leaving China to Baidu , and whatever local information sources are fully government-approved . On the question of privacy it’s true , that Gmail , Basic Search , Maps , Street View , all of these things , challenge privacy . </s>
All of these things are challenges to privacy , but no more than any other apps that are available similarly . This is not a case that Google is evil , perhaps it’s a case that the Internet is evil . But I don’t think anybody here thinks of the Internet as truly evil . Now , some say that Google’s monopoly on search , gives it so much power that this is inherently , somehow evil . Well , Google has a sizable percentage of the search market . </s>
I think that’s an admission I can make . But Google is a big company , that’s part of an information big bang , that’s far bigger . </s>
Google can not control us finding out about things . Google can not prevent criticisms of Google being made . </s>
Google’s a big player , but the market is much , much bigger than Google . </s>
There’s a more concerning evil , that I want to point you to , and I know none of you indulge this . But some people , who have problems with the way products and services are delivered , do nothing but complain . That’s the evil of apathy . If my colleagues at the far end of the table wish to characterize Google as evil , they should foreswear the use of Google products , and find the other products , which there are , and use those instead . Google’s not evil . </s>
In fact… Google’s not evil , Google’s Evel Knievel . Google’s high-flying…Google makes some mistakes . </s>
But Google is an American success story . Let me urge you once again , to vote no on the proposition . Thank you . Thank you , Jim Harper . Arguing next for the motion , Harry Lewis , a professor of computer science in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences at Harvard University , who has something to disclose… Though he’s arguing this side of the motion , his daughter is actually a Google employee . </s>
Harry Lewis . Thank you . Thank you all for being here tonight , what a great audience , I have a very simple way of stating my case for the motion . </s>
And it’s a conclusion that’s based on some facts , facts are good , so here are a few facts . If you Google “Tibetan independence , ” you’ll get back pointers to some sites , that advocate the freedom of Tibet from Chinese rule . Tibet.org , Friends of Tibet.org , </s>
sites associated with the Dalai Lama , and others . You’ll also get back some sites , that advocate against the freedom of Tibet from Chinese rule . That’s if you go home tonight , and use the version of Google that you have available to you in this country . </s>
But if you do it inside China , you won’t get references to Tibet.org , or Friends of Tibet.org , except perhaps , for references , to sites explaining that those are illegal and banned organizations . </s>
Or Epic Times , Epic Times is a Chinese newspaper , an uncensored Chinese newspaper . You can find it on the Internet , just Google Epic Times . But try to do that in China , and you will not find your way to Epic Times . Same thing with human rights if you Google that , or various spiritual practices . The world looks very different through the window that Google provides , in China , than through the window on the world that you have available to yourselves here . </s>
In fact , it’s not the picture window on the world , it’s a distorted lens that has been built , custom-built by Google to Chinese specifications . Now how did that happen . Google is the company , whose mission is to organize the world’s information , and to make it universally accessible and useful . </s>
How did it come to be in the business of creating the distorting lens , rather than the picture window on the world . Well , in 2004 , Google was entering the international market , it wanted to be the number-one search engine in the world , it started to do business in China . And the Chinese said , we don’t want you to show our citizens the world as it really is , with all of its complexities , and its contradictions , and its inconsistent sources of information . We want the Chinese citizens to know the world the way we want them to know the world . </s>
And , Google said , okay , we’ll give them that world instead of the world as it really is . Their choice was , to accept the Chinese ultimatum , or to go home . They could’ve gone home , they didn’t , they stayed , and built the engine as the Chinese wanted it . Now it’s a wonderful product . </s>
I agree with everything that’s been said about what a wonderful product it is and what a wonderful company it is . But here it’s been turned from a wonderful product , that we know , into an instrument of thought control . Now some may weakly claim that it’s doing more good than harm… that the Chinese people are better off getting partial information via the Google search window than getting no information at all . </s>
That’s nonsense , there are other search warrants , through which you can get the censored truth , if that’s what you want people to provide . Google didn’t choose the lesser of two evils when faced with the Chinese ultimatum ; it chose the more profitable of the two evils . </s>
And for that reason , you should vote for the proposition , that Google is violating its “Don’t be evil” motto . They had a simple choice that was put before them . I stopped a street vendor here in New York last week , who was selling Tibetan jewelry , he’s a Tibetan . And I said , I’m gon na debate this issue . </s>
What do you think the answer is , I don’t have to explain it to him , he knew exactly that Google works differently inside China , than it does here . And here is what he said—he said , Google had a choice between morality and money , and it chose money . </s>
That’s why Google is violating its ‘Don’t be evil’ motto . It’s a company that does many good works . It’s true that Google as a whole is not evil , I’ll grant that , but that’s not the question before us . </s>
If the question before us was , Google is evil , that’s what the question would be . That isn’t the question , the question is , does it violate what it claims not to do—not being evil . </s>
A good indicator that you’re doing something wrong is that the Congress hauls your executives , in front of them , and yells at you . And Congress has gotten into the habit of doing this several times . </s>
Most recently in May . Senator Richard Durbin confronted Google executives on this censorship question , and said , “When you’re asked to be complicit in restricting the flow of information , aren’t your hands a little dirty at the end of the day if you participate in that.” There is legislation under consideration , to prohibit exactly what Google is doing . Now to be sure , Google is in the business to make money , if it doesn’t sell advertising anywhere , then it’s not going to make money , but it’s making plenty of money . And it would have been such a statement , to the international world about the importance of , of information freedom . </s>
My friends , you are here tonight , because you value the robust debate of conflicting ideas . </s>
You value facts , you believe the truth is revealed , through this kind of debate and conflict . You should—you must vote for this proposition , if you support the idea that creating censorship tools is a form of evil . </s>
Finally , just let me close with one analogy . Suppose Google were not a search engine company , but a pharmaceutical company . And it was told by the Chinese government that it could sell aspirin in China , only if it also made certain forms of brainwashing drugs and thought control medications . And that was the condition on which it could sell aspirin in China . No responsible American company would make that deal with the Chinese authorities , and that is exactly what Google is doing in the digital realm . </s>
So , please vote for the motion , “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto” , because they do . Thank you . </s>
But not your daughter . Uh , not my daughter— No , okay . Just a reminder as we’re now halfway through our opening statements , I’m John Donvan , your host and moderator , and this Intelligence Squared US debate , we’re halfway through opening statements . You have heard from three panelists , and we’re moving on to our next three . </s>
And speaking next against the motion that “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto , ” Esther Dyson , who also has some things to disclose but having met her earlier , I know she’ll do it far better than I will . I’ll only share the fact that among all of your other activities as an investor in various Internet enterprises , you’re also currently , frequently visiting Russia because you are in training to be a cosmonaut . Yes . Uh— So I was going to start by saying that I actually spend a fair amount of time with things I consider evil . </s>
And I mean that quite seriously , the old Soviet system , which , you still see some vestiges of , in Star City where I’m training . I travel a lot , I’ve seen many ways to be evil , I’ve examined governments , I’ve talked to people who… I’m on the board of the National Endowment for Democracy , and we give grants to dissidents , so , that informs my thinking , as does the fact that I was chairman of ICANN , which is the organization that sets policy for the Internet . We made a lot of mistakes , I don’t think we were evil but we probably came a lot closer to it than Google ever did , or will . </s>
But finally in terms of the disclosures you probably want to know , I’m on the board of 23andMe which was founded , cofounded by Sergey Brin’s wife . I’m on the board of WPP Group , which calls Google its frenemy , or its froe . They’re a large advertising conglomerate . And finally , I’m on the board of Yandex , which competes with Google in Russia where , Yandex has 60 percent market share and Google has approximately 20 . </s>
So I kind of come at this from many different points of view . </s>
And , I believe that Google does not violate it’s “Don’t be evil” motto because I’ve seen it up close , I’ve also seen it from outside , I’ve seen it as a competitor , I’ve seen how they try to do things . And I am very glad to hear all this discussion of China because I’m going to blow it to bits in a few moments . But first I want to go through the few…the couple of arguments I wanted to talk about . The challenge of power , is great . The great virtue of the Internet is that it erodes power , it sucks power out of the center , and takes it to the periphery , it erodes the power of institutions over people , while giving to individuals the power to run their own lives . </s>
Google is part of that . It’s one of these things that shines light on everything , it enables people to find stuff out , it enables them to question what their governments are doing , and it’s absolutely wonderful . That doesn’t mean that power can not be abused . The abuse of power is absolutely evil . Google to some extent understands this very well , that’s why they bothered to have this motto in the first place , they understand the danger of concentration of power , and they understand how important it is not to be evil , that’s why they have shareholder agreements that give them more power so that they don’t need to cater only to money-hungry investors but can also do what they think is right . </s>
There are three people who set policies there , it’s the two founders and Eric Schmidt . And they watch one another , they’re very careful not to abuse this “Don’t be evil” thing . Now , the power that Google has is primarily a good power though it could be used to do evil , it’s not like atom bombs . It’s not like guns…or even cigarettes , which when used correctly are destructive . </s>
The power of transparency , the power of knowledge , is fundamentally good , even though it can on occasion be used for bad . </s>
And so Google’s trust is to ensure that that power is used for good as much as possible . I have seen what they’re doing in China . </s>
And ladies and gentlemen , the reason they’re not violating their “Don’t be evil” policy is because they’re in there , and they’re engaged . </s>
Yes , they could abdicate , they could say we’re not gon na bother to go into China . But every time some Chinese person uses Google , and doesn’t get what he wants , he may notice , he may not even notice the absence , but he does know that he can go find out all the negative information on George Bush he wants . And at some point , he or she says , well , gee . If I can get—or whatever the Chinese version is—if I can get this bad information about George Bush why can’t I find out more about what’s going on in my own country . </s>
Google by its very presence and its operation , even if it’s incomplete , creates increasing expectations for transparency , it starts people answering questions . It gets them to expect to be able to find out stuff . </s>
And it knows that by doing that , people are going to start asking more questions . </s>
So I think Google was doing the right thing , by going into China . I don’t think they’re making that much money there , if they are that’s fine too . But the point of it is , they are engaging . </s>
I know another example , in which they’re getting engaged . They have a service , you’ve probably encountered it , where if you go to a website—if you get a search result that indicates a website that may have some malware on it , they warn you off . This is very expensive for them to do . </s>
They need to detect the sites with malware , they need to inform them that there’s malware . They have a dispute-resolution process , they’re not perfect , but again , they’re engaging where they didn’t need to . They could easily have just passed the query through . </s>
But they’re trying to make the world a better place , by doing something that requires them to make judgments . Sometimes they may incorrectly flag a site as having malware , sometimes , somebody has malware unintentionally , they need to deal with it . So the point here again is that rather than just being apathetic , as Jim said , they’re engaging , and trying to make the world a better place . So I believe , that they do not violate their motto and I think you should vote against the proposition . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Esther Dyson . Our next speaker runs a blog , the name of which will tell you a great deal . It is…Googlization of Everything.com . Siva Vaidhyanathan is Associate Professor of Media Studies and Law at the University of Virginia , and he is also turning his blog ultimately into a book , the kind of book that depends on paper and dead trees…I assume . Siva , the floor is yours . </s>
Thank you very much . To my distinguished opponents , I see your Dr . Evil and your Dr. Pol Pot , and I raise you a pope and a poet . Specifically , Pope Gregory the Great , and the great poet Dante Alighieri . </s>
Because after all , one of the things we have to figure out here , is what do we mean by evil . Well Google encourages us to think algorithmically , after all it’s built everything that it has on algorithms . </s>
One of the simplest forms of algorithms , the if-then statement , or if you prefer , the checklist , Dante offers us such a checklist in The Divine Comedy . I know you know it , I know you know it with me , so say it along with me , the seven deadly sins , luxuria , gula , avaritia , acedia , ira , invidia , and superbia , right ? Well , okay , you didn’t say it along with me . To walk through , I can show you that Google has at times committed every single one of these seven deadly sins . The first , luxuria , which translates as extravagance or lust . </s>
I spent a bit of time on the Google campus out in California…they get massages . Right , the people who work there get massages . That is , that is corporeal lust of the highest order . </s>
Or at least for a bunch of geeks about the best they’re gon na do . </s>
Um… Number two , gula or gluttony , the other thing about the Google campus is they get incredible food , all they can eat all day , no matter what they want , there is so much food that they never need to say no , that is the very definition of gluttony . Number three . Avaritia , greed . We’ve already heard from Randy about the greed embodied in the Google-Yahoo advertising deal…that is one of many examples of Google overreaching to corner a market , or completely undermine a market , in an effort to maximize its returns . Number four , acedia , sloth . </s>
Now I could talk about how lazy and self-satisfied Google was in its effort to roll out an on- line video service . The early days of Google Video were very much a matter of figuring they owned the video realm and they weren’t actually gon na do anything new or fantastic until these whippersnappers at YouTube came across with their Flash video platform , and basically ran around them to the point where they ended up having to buy that company just to keep pace . </s>
But there’s actually a better example of sloth and that is Google itself , its very nature , its very model of advertising is based on free-riding . </s>
Google makes money off of our work . We blog , we put our skate—our cats on skateboards and record them for videos . We do all of this work , and then Google harvests our work , runs all of this content through this computers , spits it back out at us , with almost no actual value added and what we end up getting is a tremendous amount of money , based on free- riding , the very definition of sloth . Wrath , ira , wrath . There are a number of high-profile cases of people who have been involved with Google through their Ad Sense program , through which they’ve agreed to place ads on their own blogs . </s>
I think Jeff is one of these people but not one who has suffered the wrath of Google . </s>
Many of these people have found their accounts shut down , their revenues stopped , for reasons that can never be explained , but they did something to violate Google’s policies . But they get no feedback and no response , and no justice . </s>
And then there are hundreds of small companies all around America , that have found their ranks decimated , their Google ranks decline significantly , because again , they tried to optimize their results , they were just doing what a company should do , trying to get more attention for themselves . And Google’s algorithms , its faceless , soulless algorithms came at them with wrath , another of the seven deadly sins . Invidia , envy . </s>
Google has over the last few years engaged in a series of efforts to try to muscle in on the markets of other successful companies , Microsoft being the most prominent . Google has recently tried to push its suite of services that directly compete with Microsoft Office . Of course they have at various times threatened to muscle out eBay , muscle out PayPal , muscle out Amazon , in various ways . Number seven , the one I want to talk about the most , superbia , pride , or hubris . Now , let me remind you of the actual motto of the company , it’s not “Do no evil” or “Don’t be evil , ” it’s actually , “To organize the world’s information to make it universally accessible.” </s>
What could be more hubristic than that . What could be more prideful than that . General Motors doesn’t say we’re gon na organize all the places in the country and make them universally accessible . General Motors says we’re gon na try to sell cars . Not that that’s the best example to use this week , I understand . </s>
Nonetheless , no company besides Google would ever come up with a motto or a mission statement like that , but let me tell you something that Sergey Brin , one of the founders of Google said a number of years ago , during an interview when someone asked him , what would the perfect search engine be like . </s>
And he said , without missing a beat , it would be like the mind of God . Ladies and gentlemen , that’s more than hubris , that’s blasphemy . Now the particular kind of hubris that energizes Google is of course , a sense of techno-fundamentalism . </s>
The notion that you can always invent something , to solve the problem that the last invention created . And that faith in technology , that technology can cover all of our sins and all of our faults and fix all of our problems , is again the ultimate hubris , it’s the hubris expressed in the myth of Pandora for instance , the myth of having too much knowledge . </s>
There are so many examples in human history in which techno- fundamentalism has led to great suffering . </s>
Not that Google is about to lead us to great suffering , but they’re still committing the sin of hubris . Now hubris is actually the most serious of the seven deadly sins . As Dante explains to us , it was the sin that Lucifer committed . Lucifer was a good guy . </s>
Lucifer fell , because he thought he could be as effective as God , as good as God , and thus , he became Satan . The very notion of the “Don’t be evil” motto , is itself hubristic , is itself , evil , because it is itself a violation of the seven deadly sins . </s>
One real-world example , let me finish with very quickly , Google Book Search . Google has been trying to scan in 36 million books from libraries around the world , in an effort to essentially corner the market on digital book access , for a number of years . Early on , four years ago when it started this project or got public with this project , it claimed that everything was cool as far as copyright was concerned . </s>
In other words , copyright only applies to mere mortals , not to superhuman supercompanies like Google . Well , it turns out Google wasn’t right about that , last month Google ended up having to settle , and wrote a check for $ 125 million to publishers and authors , because it turns out , they weren’t quite as on the ball about copyright as they thought . Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you , Siva Vaidhyanathan . Our final speaker against the motion , Jeff Jarvis , has had a foot in what we call the legacy media as a cofounding editor of Entertainment Weekly magazine , he was also a TV critic for TV Guide and for People . But of late he has been very much of the blogosphere with a blog called Buzz Machine.com and he also teaches interactive journalism at the City University of New York’s Graduate School of Journalism . Jeff Jarvis . </s>
And I guess in both full disclosure and a plug I should say I have a book coming out called , What Would Google Do ? That’s blasphemy ! You 're just jealous . Massage would feel good right now , would n't it ? We should remember where this pledge came from . </s>
The chiefs of Google have said that the real purpose of the “Don’t Be Evil” pledge is to give employees the license to remind their bosses of this in meetings . So , a geek can stand there and say , is that evil ? </s>
The kind of thing a geek would say . </s>
And it’s , it’s useful . Imagine , ladies and gentleman , if we had that phrase , “don’t be evil , ” chiseled over every door on Wall Street . Would we not have a better world today ? </s>
In this poisoned process that led to the financial crisis , if just one , or two , or five , or ten people had said , Hmm… taking poison mortgages , or giving them , is that evil ? Creating poison assets and selling them , is that evil ? So , I think it’s important to just recognize that the rule itself is good . </s>
The fact that Google asks it is good . And we should wish that it should n't be special subject of a debate that a company promises not to be evil . The fact that it’s special is , itself , a virtue . So , I would like to match the seven deadly sins with eight , I’ll beat you , virtues of Google . And let’s remember that virtue does leaven evil . </s>
We all mess up , right ? So virtue matters . </s>
So number one , Google has opened up , as my colleagues have said , the world’s knowledge to the world , or stipulate China , most of the world’s knowledge to most of the world . And that’s important . </s>
It has changed our very view of facts and knowledge and accuracy . No longer do we end an argument saying , I don’t know . We go to Google . </s>
Google will tell us . And it will tell us that in a blink of an eye . Now , in fact , I went to Google , and I asked Google how fast does an eye blink . And it told me in point three seconds that an eye blinks in point three seconds . Your life is richer now because of Google . </s>
Number two , Google respects the wisdom of the crowd . We are too often not respected . There’s a snobbishness about my old colleagues in big old media . </s>
Google does n't have that . Google learns what it learns because it trusts us . Is n't that nice ? Should n't companies do that ? </s>
Should n't politicians do that ? Would n't trust matter ? Google in its very essence trusts us . Number three , Google takes the wisdom of the crowd , it knows we have wisdom , and it gives it back to us . It gives us our own knowledge . </s>
Look at the Google flu trends search . It lets us know how often we search for a flu , and how the flu trend is coming . </s>
That is our knowledge , not Google’s . Google shares our own knowledge with us , it gives it back , it does add value , if not flaming cat videos , to our own wisdom . Google connects people . </s>
This is so important . We often are accused on line of being anti-social . I think we’ve become hyper-social . </s>
I think we’re more connected . I met Esther and Siva because of Google , because of searches . </s>
I looked at Google , and there’s Siva on the other side . And so I think the importance of Google connecting people can not be underestimated . Our children today connect in ways across cultures we don’t even know , yes sometimes it makes us nervous , but I think that it can only be good . </s>
Admit it , how many of you have searched Google for an old girlfriend or boyfriend ? Aw , come on , you liars . Now , part of the problem is , I can say this because I have gray hair , that probably , the probability of finding someone is inversely proportional to your age . But young people will stay connected to their friends for the rest of their lives . Imagine the impact that will have on friendship and society , and Google is the mechanism that makes that happen . </s>
Five , Google creates platforms , it is a platform that enables us to create . A recent poll said eighty percent of Americans think they have a book in them . We should be glad that most don’t come out . </s>
But we have seen in Google that it is an age of creation , and Google creates the platforms , the tools to let us create , the means to let us pay for that . </s>
I think that’s very , very important . Six , Google does have ads . Last year I made a big four thousand , five hundred dollars on Google ads . </s>
I should n't quit the day job , I know . But , if you want to compare , my dear colleagues on the other side , the view of Google toward its advertising structure , compare it to a monopoly newspaper , which set the price , which set its own rules , which allowed you to only do so many things with their space , well , no , we can do what we want with our ads . We can start whole businesses with it . We can create movements with it . We can be found with it . </s>
That’s important . And I believe that Google ads will help support the future even of news . Seven , Google.org , the foundation started by Google , is supported by one percent of the equity , and one percent of the profits of the company . And it is trying to solve , with hubris , the problem of energy and global warming in one fell swoop . </s>
But I’ve learned that they 're doing it in a unique techno-smart way , the way engineers do . Engineers solve problems . </s>
We have a problem , they 're looking for the solution . Politicians are trying to get us on energy with regulation and taxes and prohibitions and slaps on the wrist . Google is giving this investment , and innovation , and invention . </s>
And if it can solve the problem of power cheaper than coal , then we don’t have to save anymore , we can use as much as we want . Google understands abundance . Finally , eight , Google has a new model on how to treat employees . We get , they get , massages . Finally , I want to say that Google teaches us to understand our new world in new ways . </s>
And if we are too critical of Google I think we give up that opportunity to see this new world and understand it through the lens of Google . In this new economy , I don’t think companies will be built anymore by huge capital , making huge acquisitions , they will be built , as Google has , through networks and platforms . We have a lot to learn from Google . As we try to understand this new world of links and connectedness and platforms and networks and generosity and speed , we would do well to ask ourselves , “what would Google do ? ” Google is not evil . </s>
In the examples it gives , and in the fact that it vows not to be evil , Google is a model to us all . Our world is better off because we have Google . So please , have a moment of decency , and vote against the motion . Thank you Jeff Jarvis . </s>
That concludes our opening round , and in a minute or two I 'm going to turn to you and ask whoever is there seething to respond to something that you’ve just heard that outrages you to do so . And we will also shortly be turning to questions from the audience . But I want to restate our motion that “Google Violates Its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto” And as you know when you came in this evening , we asked you to vote for your opinion on this motion . </s>
And we have the numbers now , which I 'm about to reveal , numbers which will appear on Google in perpetuity from this moment forward . Before the debate , twenty- one percent of you agreed with the motion , thirty-one percent of you were against the motion , and forty-eight percent of you were undecided . </s>
And that forty-eight percent is very valuable , it’s one of the largest undecided votes we’ve seen so far this season , maybe the largest . And again , reminding you that this is a contest for changing minds , so that forty-eight percent is a very , very large pie , to cut up , and we will be asking you to vote a little bit later on again in the evening . </s>
But first I want to turn to you , and I’ll count to three to see if a hand goes up , if anybody… Oh , OK . </s>
Harry Lewis , for the motion . I’d just like to point out that our opposition tried both tactics to persuade you to vote against the motion . They said that evil means Hitler , Pol Pot , and the worst gulags of the Soviet Union . And they’ve also said , they mean by evil something that’s a much higher standard . Now , I would like to think , and I would like to ask the opposition if they don’t think that when Google made their motion , made their motto , “don’t be evil , ” that they were not holding them to the standard that they should n't be as evil as Pol Pot , Hitler , and the worst of the Soviet Union , and if anything better than that , they would get a pass on the “don’t be evil” motto . </s>
Jim , Jim Harper ? </s>
Jim Harper , take that one . Jim Harper speaking for the motion . Now , the question is as to the motto , and I would , I spoke to both versions , the actual , genuine meaning of the word evil , but what they may have meant , which is the sort of corporate greed kind of thing . Greed , which as Siva pointed out , drives them , wrongly apparently , to compete with eBay and Microsoft and Amazon , that 's not an indictment of a company to say that they 're competing with others , trying to serve consumers better than with whom they , than with whom they compete . By any standard Google is not violating the “don’t be evil” policy that they put forward . </s>
Jim , your teammate , Esther Dyson . Yeah , the purpose of this motto is that these guys are smart , and they are aware of the possibility of evil , they 're aware that their extraordinary success and their extraordinary ability to collect information gives them a lot of power , and they do not want to abuse it . The other thing I’d like to point out is that Google , using Google is voluntary . Pol Pot , all these dictators , they were not voluntary . Google , whether it wanted to be evil or not , is constrained by the forces of competition , and it’s well aware of that . </s>
It has to earn your favor . It discloses to you what it does with your information . You can go and search your web history . </s>
So there , they 're using their power to do good and to make the world more transparent . </s>
Siva , you want to jump in ? Yeah , Jim , you’ve fallen into my trap . So , can you get close to your mic a little bit ? Of course . </s>
So , you’ve fallen into my trap by citing the fact that every company should be expected to compete , and should , in fact , probably be extravagant , be gluttonous , be greedy , be slothful , be wrathful , and be envious , and of course , hubristic . Every company should , because that’s what companies should do , they should compete , they should win , they should crush… No , they should win , they should not crush— MAN Siva , you’ve fallen into your own bog— </s>
And by that , by that I say , it is for the companies to violate the seven deadly sins , and not to pretend they don’t , and it is for popes and poets to warn us against it . Randy Picker for , let me bring in Randy Picker for the motion . I hate to be a textualist , but I brought the registration statement with me , right , let’s see what it says . Don’t be evil . We believe strongly that in the long term we will be better served as shareholders and in all other ways by a company that does good things for the world , even if we forgo some short term gains . </s>
The question is , when does Google , faced with a conflict between what’s good for the world sacrifice its own interests . I don’t think it’s doing that . Jeff Jarvis ? Let’s look at Yahoo , may it rest in peace . </s>
Yes . Shall we have a moment of silence for Jerry Yang , dearly departed . Not good radio . Continue . </s>
Yes . </s>
Yahoo was the last old structure , the last old media company . </s>
Google is a new company . </s>
Eric Schmidt was asked recently by Jim Kramer how much they could make by putting ads on their home page . Some untold billions of dollars , he said . They chose not to do that . Is that good versus evil ? I actually argue it is , because Google recognizes that it’s not an end , like Yahoo . </s>
It’s not an old media company , it’s a new media company that gets us to what we want to get to . That itself is a virtue . I think the problem we’re having here is defining the fall from grace . And if we all define it the way that you are trying to hold Google , then we’re all going to hell , because— </s>
This has been a very theological evening so far . That word evil does it . WWGD . Um… And so I think that Google recognizes that life is a beta . Google puts out products and says , they 're not done yet . </s>
They are wrong , they 're incomplete , please help us fix them . Google is not trying to say that they are ultimately absolutely virtuous . If we all tried to define ourselves that way , we’d be doomed . </s>
Siva ? So , Jeff has compared Google to Wall Street firms and said , would n't it be great if Wall Street firms had that motto chiseled in their buildings . He’s compared Google to newspapers that have local monopolies , and pointed out that newspapers , of course , fix prices on advertising . And now he’s compared Google to Yahoo . None of that matters . </s>
It does not matter that any other company behaves badly , or behaves in an evil way , because none of those companies ever were foolish enough to chisel such a motto into their buildings or their financial filing statements . </s>
Now that , the fact is— Should they have ? Should they have ? …that Google has set its own standard , and has not met its own standard . It has set its own standard , and I believe it has met it . </s>
It has aspired to do good . It has , as I said , engaged in an evil world to make it better . </s>
To me that’s the opposite of evil . Harry Lewis , do you think Google actually meant it when it said that it wanted to commit no evil , or was that the most cynical declaration of all time ? </s>
It was an aspirational statement— They meant it ? …and just as many of us make promises that we have to acknowledge we are unable to keep , Google has been unable , virtuously and continuously , to keep its aspirational promise . I think it’s a good thing that Google made that aspirational promise . </s>
The question is whether it ever violates it , and the answer is plainly that it does . Esther , you were talking about China . Harry says going to China , and essentially he’s saying collaborating with the regime , and I choose all of those words because that’s exactly what his point was , was an act of evil . </s>
And you 're arguing that a little access is a good thing . </s>
It , no , I'm—a little access is a good thing , but I 'm arguing something more important . It’s not collaborating with the regime , it is… It is infiltrating the regime , it is spreading information within China , it’s exposing people to the virtues of knowledge . It’s changing their expectations . It’s creating more transparency . </s>
Long run , you will see that Google is going to change China by opening those cracks . Every time you open a crack and insert something in it , it starts to crumble . We’re going to hear from your teammate Jeff Jarvis in just a moment , because he has something he wants to say . </s>
But at this point I’d like to bring the house lights up . And if you have questions , raise your hands , and we have folks with microphones circulating . I know that there are some journalists in the audience , and we’re happy to have your questions , we just would ask that you’d identify yourselves . And if some , in some other way you have some dog in the fight in a way that you would like to disclose , that would be a good thing too . No , we believe in disclosure regardless . </s>
Jeff Jarvis ? Even if you wish that Google did differently in China , and I , frankly I do , I wish they’d use their power . The important thing is to realize the basis upon which they made this decision . </s>
And they used their “don’t be evil” pledge as a basis to debate and decide this . </s>
They made their decision not out of pure greed , but out of the belief , agree with it or disagree with it , but out of the belief that they were trying to do good . Let’s go to a question halfway up , and again , passing the microphone down , and reminding you of our disclosure request . Right , so my name is Larry Lessig , I 'm a professor at Stanford , and Stanford gets lots of money from Google for some reason , I do n't know why… But , first a comment to Siva , and then a question for Harry . </s>
The comment for Siva is , it’s not actually true to say , Siva , that Google paid a hundred twenty-five million dollars for something that it originally claimed it could do for free . It paid a hundred and twenty-five million dollars to do something far beyond what it originally claimed fair use protected it to do . </s>
And it explicitly says in the agreement that it does not believe that its original fair use claims are false , as I believe its fair use claims are true , so what it’s done is just bought a right that before it never claimed . This is not settling . For people who are unaware of this settlement , could you take three sentences to explain— Long sentences ? </s>
I 'm a lawyer , so… Yeah , but I think you can do it . </s>
We’re , you 're talking about the publishing— </s>
Right , so Google originally claimed it had the right to scan these eighteen , or thirty-six million books— One sentence . …and at least make available snippets of the books that were still in copyright— </s>
Comma— …but out of print . </s>
Period . The settlement gives Google the right to display twenty percent of a book , plus , if a user chooses , to then give user access to the full book if they pay . That is wildly more than anybody thought fair use— Siva— </s>
…would grant them the right to do— We’ll come to your second question , I want Siva to respond to that , because— Yeah , I’ll— …basically , what’s wrong with , especially since a lot of these , millions of books were out of print , you could n't get to unless you traveled halfway across the world to a dusty library , and what you can now get online . I don’t want to argue that , that making this material available is an example of evil , what was evil was the hubris in arguing that they could fly above the basics of copyright when they do it . </s>
And Larry and I have had this argument going on for about four years , we don’t want to invite everybody else into it , nonetheless , we— </s>
No , no , no , we do , we— We’re at , we’re at loggerheads on it . But I do want to point out that of the hundred and twenty-five million dollars that Google willfully paid in the settlement , people don’t give away money for nothing , they basically were paying the authors and the publishers ninety-one million dollars to settle the damages that were claimed by the authors and publishers . Right ? Simple math . </s>
No something for nothing . The extra services that Google is now providing will take up thirty-four million dollars of that that hundred and twenty-five million . </s>
So , in fact , the settlement was a concession that they probably had flown too close to the sun— Randy Picker wants to add to that . Yeah , don’t focus on the dollars , focus on a different issue . So the basic structure of copyright law is , subject to fair use , you have to get permission . </s>
Google has done something incredibly clever , evil , I don’t know , in the settlement which is , by turning it into an opt-out class action , and now I just said a bunch of legal words that you 're not going to like , they’ve effectively changed the default position with regard to how copyright’s consent system works . That’s either brilliant because of the orphan works problem , clever , or evil , I don’t know . </s>
But bottom line , for those of us who are n't lawyers and don’t know the terms of the debate— Yeah . …did , did Google serve its own interests in this deal ? Very much so , I think . </s>
Maybe the public interest at the same time— Larry , you have , Larry you had a , from the audience , you had a question— They also served the interests of people who want to read books that were no longer available , and authors to get payments . Thank you . </s>
Larry , to your question . </s>
Right , so the question to Harry . So you observed that your reason for calling your daughter’s company evil is that… Thanks a lot , she’ll love you for that . …is that it complies with the Chinese rules about censoring a certain class of speech . </s>
During the political campaign that we’ve just ended , John McCain complained to Yahoo , I mean , to YouTube , part of Google , that YouTube was complying with American copyright laws and censoring a whole bunch of speech that he thought should be kept up on the internet . Now , would you say a company is evil when it complies with American law and censors speech , or is it , or is a company— OK , we , the question— …obliged to keep all speech available regardless of the local law that might control it ? </s>
In the case of John McCain , I 'm actually with John McCain in wishing that YouTube would exercise a little more judgement before it automatically pulled the , the campaign videos down , although I understand the practical reasons why that’s important , and I understand why , under the Safe Haven rules , they would have the knee jerk reaction . But Google actually could afford to review some of those videos in the middle of a political campaign to make a judgement about whether they were fair use or not , and I wish they had . MAN But complying with— Would the audience agree with that ? Those who agree , just a round of applause to that . </s>
And those who don’t agree , those who don’t agree ? About fifty-fifty . We’re going to go to another question up in the , halfway up . Who’s there ? </s>
OK , we have one down front , to the , to your left here . And again , I will applaud a very cogent question . I’ve written it down , actually . </s>
Excellent . </s>
Just to… I 'm John , I work for King Features , which is an online company . And I must say , someone brought up the point , if you put “don’t be evil” over financial services companies , somehow they miraculously think that they 're not going to be evil . I think that people that are involved with the mortgage industry and the credit default sweeps , I still think to this day they probably are doing probably the benefit and the goodness of the financial services . So here’s my question . If Google is willing to limit search to get market share , what would limit them from disclosing personal search information of citizens to gain or maintain a market share . </s>
Jeff Jarvis . Great question , when you got to it , by the way . With all respect , I think you 're showing little faith in mankind . </s>
It’s not Google you have a problem with , but man . Yes , even in a financial organization there can be someone who would ask the question , force the issue , is this evil ? And similarly in Google , there is not only that , but there is also the self interest that Google does have a brand and a reputation . </s>
And if Google messes with us , we can use the internet and find ourselves on Google to get Google back . And we will . </s>
So Google , in its enlightened self interest , I believe would not mess with us . OK , just a time check on where we are . We’re about halfway through the head to head discussion . Just a reminder , I 'm John Donvan , your host and moderator of this Intelligence Squared US Debate where the motion is : “Google Violates Its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto.” </s>
“Google Violates Its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto.” We have three debaters for and against , and we are , at this point , taking questions from the audience , and we have , yes I see you Madame . </s>
Hi , Meghan Keane with Wired.com . I 'm just wondering about Yahoo and Google’s search partnership , and , did efforts to stop Google from forming a monopoly just end up speeding up the demise of its competitor ? And , if you all have any thoughts on who might be able to save Yahoo now that Yang has stepped down ? Yeah , so on the question— Randy Picker . </s>
On the question of demise , I think that the question is , is Microsoft , who wanted to buy Yahoo before , still a natural purchaser . Obviously the scuttlebutt in today’s newspapers and online is that the change in management yesterday may increase that possibility . </s>
So if you ask what the natural deal is , that’s the natural deal . </s>
It’s not obvious to me that deal will actually matter . Maybe Esther’s in a better position to talk about that , but that seems to me the most natural next move for Yahoo . Yeah , it’s , there are other acquirers , such as AOL , but I think the most important thing to learn from this is that companies that get into trouble usually are not murdered by Google or anybody else , they commit suicide . </s>
Question from the gentleman in the center . I confess to being a father of a daughter who works at Google also . I would like to ask the panel , either side of the question , where do the shareholders figure into this ? Are they evil , are you asking ? Pardon ? </s>
Are the shareholders evil ? Well , in a certain sense , yes , I 'm asking that question . I 'm asking what—we’re talking about Google as if it was an abstract drawing , OK , when in fact there are these shareholders out there , and don’t they have a voice in how the company behaves ? </s>
Or should they ? Esther ? I think Google feels , and I agree , that shareholders matter , but not a lot . They , if their interests are short term profits , they can buy and sell and go away . What the founders wanted to create was a company where they were not driven by short term shareholder considerations . </s>
So , they 're driven to some extent by long term shareholder considerations . They don’t want to sell their shares , they want this thing to be worth a lot in the long run , and I would say that 's the basic attitude . But Harry Lewis , I think you are almost arguing , in your China argument , that you 're disappointed that shareholders did not protest . Oh , I think , yes , I think that Google’s international reputation would have soared had they stood firmly against the Chinese censorship . </s>
It would have been in their long term interests , as many of the other measures that Google has made had . Jim Harper ? </s>
As a shareholder question , this is very much like the question of people who complain about Google but don’t do anything about it . Shareholders are free to sell , and they would if Google was evil , if they were violating their motto . Unfortunately , they would n't actually— Shareholders hold . Esther , I don’t think your mic was on , could you make— </s>
Yeah , I know . I don’t , unfortunately , I don’t think the shareholders would have sold if they thought Google was evil . They 're free to . They 're free to . I also don’t think they would have applauded had Google stayed out of China . </s>
They probably would not have noticed , to be candid . Siva ? Someone’s been selling Google’s shares— They’ve been selling everybody’s— </s>
Well , exactly . </s>
But people have been selling Google shares for reasons they do n't disclose . </s>
Right ? It’s a simple signal they send to the market . Nonetheless , remember that a publicly traded company that’s doing very well can afford to hold out a motto like “Don’t be evil.” When things get tough , and as Harry’s brought up , they have to make a decision between revenue and egalitarianism , they 're going to pick revenue , as they have every time . </s>
We’re going to another question , halfway up , gentleman in the white shirt . Yes , hi . I have no relationship with Google . </s>
Other than being a , a Google user at times . So I , I wanted to just raise one point to the against side , that I have kind of a problem with the fact that , you know , you 're , basically you seem , Esther , I believe , Esther , I believe , made the point that Google aspires to , to embrace , or to , to live up to this motto . </s>
But I kind of feel like you 're conflating aspiration with accomplishment . </s>
And I also feel like Jeff , you’ve kind of made the point that , well , just because Google has done , eight , or nine , or ten , or twenty good things , that that somehow would eliminate if they had done anything bad . But the question is , did they violate the motto , which means that they commit actions that are , that are evil , or acts of evil . All right . The point that , you know , the law professor here in the audience raised , of the fact that Google is adhering to , to legal norms in whatever market they belong to , raises the , the profound problem for me that Google itself has said that they aspire to be able to predict what we want to do before we know it ourselves . </s>
And , with the accumulation of so much information from people , which is not opted in , what if the , the government in some other place were to decide that Google needed to share that information with people— </s>
I 'm going to stop you there— …or with the government itself ? …and thank you for the question . And there were a few questions there , but Jeff , you had more of a challenge to your view than question , so— On the aspirational point , I think that your standard , then , is perfection . </s>
It is , in fact , God-like . Because what you 're saying is that if you fail at anything beyond this pledge of being evil , you’ve somehow failed . </s>
And I don’t think anyone here in reasonable mind would hold any of us here , or Google , or anyone short of God , to that . And so , I also think that it’s important that , that your other issue is that , is this God-Google omniscient , does it know everything about us , and can that be tapped by someone else ? I think it’s a mistake to say , similarly , the opposite of the aspirational question , if that could happen , it , ergo , is true . </s>
If Google could do bad , ergo it is bad . Or Google is big , and big is often bad , ergo Google is bad . None of that follows . OK , and just for our radio audience , I just want to say , Jeff Jarvis answering that question . Esther Dyson ? </s>
Yeah , just briefly I want to respond to one thing you said , and point out the real danger here is not Google , it’s the government . </s>
And governments have power which can easily be abused . Google is constrained . It’s constrained by law , it’s constrained by competition , it’s constrained by its users , and it responds to those constraints , and that’s one reason it’s not able . But I think the other reason is , it does n't want to be . Siva , can you be brief on this , because there is a question— </s>
Very brief . I actually want to echo what Esther said , and again , just because there are more evil institutions in the world than Google does not mean that our case , that they violated their motto , is not true . </s>
Right ? </s>
The fact that the federal government is much more evil does not absolve Google of responsibility of maintaining information that can be easily , secretly gathered . Right ? If the FBI comes with a national security letter to Google and says , we want to know everything about Randy Picker , Randy Picker will never know that that happens , and no one at Google can talk about the fact that it happens . Right ? </s>
That’s the black box we’re dealing with . Google is a black box , the federal government is a black box . The interaction of two black boxes are , is a serious danger . That does n't mean Google has done anything specifically , actively evil , but it certainly has enabled the potential of real evil . Question all the way in the back . </s>
Hi , Kevin Williamson , National Review , which may explain the slightly Thomistic tenor of this question , but this is really for those who are arguing for the motion , are n't you arguing that Google is in fact violating a different motto , which would say “don’t do evil , ” versus a motto that says “don’t be evil.” Every business makes some sort of compromise , every business makes a mistake . Everybody who’s ever paid a dollar in taxes has made a compromise with evil at some point . But… </s>
It’s staying theological , and it was a great question . </s>
Harry Lewis for the motion— Are n't you arguing against a different motto— I was waiting for this Clintonian , or Clinton-esque moment where the debate turned to the question of what the meaning of “be” is . Are you going to take that question ? I 'm sorry , I was briefly distracted , I thought you were on a roll . </s>
No , I was , I— MAN You were done . I was , my answer is really done— No , no , I actually think there’s something to the question . I , — The question , the question calls for an assessment of the totality of the company , not picking out individual instances where you don’t like what Google does , and we’ve made cases that there are many , many of those are , are falsities . </s>
The totality of , the company invited this discussion , first of all , by having this motto , and now exposes itself to this kind of discussion . </s>
And I think it holds up well , given all that . Well— Harry Lewis . </s>
If being evil means being evil in your heart , and they— Ah , well… </s>
Harry Lewis . Esther , if that’s what they meant , they could have said it . </s>
They did n't say it . They did n't say… They set the standard for the— They 're brief , they 're brief . They set the standard . </s>
Unlike lawyers , they 're brief . </s>
Hmmm ? Unlike lawyers , they 're brief and succinct . Question down front . </s>
I’m Vinnie Mankovsky , I don’t have anything to do with Google , but I have two questions , one for Harry Lewis , the other is for Siva . </s>
I 'm going to ask you to choose one , OK ? Oh , that’s difficult , let’s go with the China one . </s>
Having lived for twenty years under communism in Bulgaria , and having been listening to the Voice of America and Free Europe , which were broadcasted by the US mainly , and were , noised by the Bulgarian authorities as well as the Russian and everyone else in the east bloc , according to what you say , the US should not have actually radio transmitted Voice of America because our authorities were actually , making noise on the same frequency . But I can tell you , if we did n't have access to this little information , we today would not have been members of NATO or the European Union . So how would you— </s>
No , no , they , there is n't a parallel between the United States Voice of America and Google . Google is a business , and that , the issue for Google only came up because they wanted to set up shop inside China , have employees there , run their servers there , and do business with , inside China , and there are rules inside China for how businesses have to operate . And if I can just respond to Professor Lessig’s statement , I agree that businesses doing business in a country have to obey the laws of the country they 're doing business in . And my contention is that Google made the wrong decision in deciding to do business in a country whose demands were so inconsistent with their fundamental mission in life . So there’s more evidence to how freedom breaks out in a country that I think people should consider . </s>
In Czechoslovakia , Vaclav Havel was a playwright , and he wrote very obscure plays that the authorities did n't understand well . But the fact that people went to the plays , they talked about them , they were talking about revolution , they were talking about freedom . </s>
Similar things are happening now with Google’s help in China . They 're using cultural references that the authorities don’t understand , and that Google and nobody else can control . They 're using language , they 're talking to each other , they 're communicating with each other , and they 're finding each other through Google . I 'm not concerned about the— </s>
Well , if I can just add— We have a— </s>
Just to be clear , Google is not actually the major search engine that’s actually used in China , so there are other avenues . </s>
I want to go to , in the little bit of time we have left , get in two more questions , up in the far right . </s>
One of my questions about China was just addressed . The other question was about the Google Chrome browser , which allows it to collect personal advertising information . I was wondering how both sides of the motion felt that it could use this as a force for good or for evil . The collection of personal information ? </s>
Yes , through the browser . </s>
Is there , Esther , a good use of the collection of personal information ? Sure , it can , if a user wants this information , it can be extremely valuable for the user . The user may want to share that information with other people . People keep talking as if users’ information was most , ought to be secret . People are now going on line voluntarily sharing it . </s>
They love comparing themselves . They like to compare their music tastes , they like to know whether they 're hot or not . </s>
I like to compare… …my genome with other people’s genomes . And the ability to know more about yourself , to share it with other people , that’s what mirrors are for , and they 're best sellers . I’ll show you my genome if you show me yours ? Siva ? The issue behind privacy and the regulation of personal information is not that people should or should not , or do or do not want to share . </s>
The issue is a matter of personal autonomy . Having the easy to access controls over who sees what in what context . And it’s a much more fluid complicated and multi- faceted question that simply the idea that we are putting our favorite music up on Facebook in large , in torrents . </s>
That 's true , but it’s not relevant . The fact is , Chrome and Gmail offer us no way to manage our personal information . </s>
Google service— You do n't need— </s>
…harvest their , that information , and people use Chrome and Gmail without any real knowledge or recognition or simple acknowledgement of the transaction . Most people who use Google do not understand the transaction in which they are engaging . And that is a problem . Our last question , from right down front . </s>
Make it a doozy . I’d like some clarity on the definition of evil that we’re using . If an entity has a good goal and achieves them imperfectly , in such that some bad is caused by the imperfect achievement of those goals , is that evil ? I do n't see anything evil in spoiling your employees or in choosing to place some value on an ad-free search result such that it costs more for the advertisers . I potentially see evil in the decision to censor the results in China , if that was a decision made for the goal of , of financial return . </s>
But at bottom you 're asking what ? Do we have any way of knowing what Google’s goals are in making these decisions , and if we don’t , do we have any way of evaluation whether or not they 're evil . </s>
Siva ? Oh , we each have the capacity of judging whether any particular action is evil . I , of course , am appealing to authority , one of the classic fallacies , the authority being Dante and Pope Gregory . But , I did n't mean to do so quite so facetiously . </s>
I do mean to say that all of the things that big , successful corporations should do tend to trample on the cannon of good and evil that we have been swimming in . And in fact , it’s hypocritical for a company to say that it will hold itself to a high standard . It’s perfectly reasonable for Google to do almost everything it has done as a profit making venture , uh , and I applaud most of what it’s done . But the real question is , is this standard itself being undermined by its very actions ? </s>
Is the fact that it set this high standard for itself ultimately foolish ? Thank you very much , and that includes the head to head portion of the discussion , and thanks for your terrific questions , which , which actually were quite good questions , and kept things moving along . We’re going to move along now to final statements . This is the last chance that each of the panelists will have , really , to lock you in . They’ll each get two minutes to speak . </s>
But before we do that , I want to remind you of where we were in terms of the numbers . Before the debate , when we polled you on the motion that Google violates its “don’t be evil” motto , twenty-one percent of you were for the motion , thirty-one percent were against , and a very large forty-eight percent were undecided . </s>
So , we’re moving forward now to closing statements . Each panelist will have two minutes . And we are going to begin with Jim Harper , who is the director of information policy studies at the Cato Institute , speaking against the motion . </s>
Jim ? Well , first I want to congratulate and thank our opponents in this debate , they have a very , very difficult chore ahead of them . They did the best they could , and I congratulate them on what meager success they had in , in their arguments . Important point , Google invited this conversation . Google deserves your credit for having this conversation . </s>
And as Jeff pointed out , inviting this conversation internally as well . There is a culture there that is essentially good . There are decisions they have made that I have openly criticized . I disagree with some of the things Google does . </s>
The totality of what Google does , and the totality of what Google is , is not evil . It is good . </s>
And I think you should support opposing the motion… You should oppose the motion… Because Google is , at its heart , a good company that provides extraordinary services to the public , and makes extraordinary amounts of information available to the public , and is working around the world to make information available . </s>
And the slights that have been heaped upon it by our opponents do not overcome their burden , we think , and we hope you think , that Google is a good company . Please oppose the motion . Thank you Jim Harper . </s>
And making his summarizing statement for the motion , Randy Picker , professor at the University of Chicago Law School . Randy Picker ? Well , I 'm both a lawyer and an economist . And as an economist I think the issue before us is what I’ll call marginal evil , incremental evil . </s>
I think that’s where we are with regard to Google . That’s the question . </s>
When are they creating evil that they do n't need to create ? When are they making a choice that we should understand to be one that benefits Google and hurts the market , hurts other participants in that market . Where I started was something that went to the heart of their business model . </s>
This is n't a side show , this is not an experiment , this is at the heart of the way Google does business . And what they are doing there is doing exactly what we see monopolists doing . Since the Sherman Act was passed in 1890 , they exercise market power . That’s what Google is doing . We heard a lot of discussion , I have n't heard , actually , anything about that . </s>
I think that’s because it’s not possible to refute that , and I don’t think it’s actually transparent to most people how they 're doing it . And when someone asks Google whether they 're doing that , Google says , we’re running auctions , we don’t have power , notwithstanding our market share is sixty-five percent in the United States . That is acting in a way that is being evil . Thank you , Randal Picker . </s>
Summarizing against the motion , Esther Dyson , an investor in information technologies companies . Esther Dyson ? Thank you . </s>
The thing does n't say don’t be incrementally evil . I , you know , when you have to sort of get down to these fine distinctions I think it’s clear you 're losing . So , I would encourage you guys… …to join the winning side , and vote against this unsupportable proposition . </s>
Google is not violating its don’t be evil motto . They are doing good . They are opening up the world , they are giving people more choices , they 're giving people awareness of their choices , they 're increasing transparency and people’s personal autonomy . Mostly what they are doing , and the thing for which I give them most credit is , they 're eroding the power and limiting the ability of those in power to abuse that power by shining light , and by encouraging people to change their expectations , to start asking for answers . They 're giving everybody the ability to watch the watchers in this increasingly transparent world . </s>
So , please join us , the winning side , and vote no . Thank you , Esther Dyson . Summarizing his position for the motion , Harry Lewis , Professor of Computer Science at Harvard University . Well , not everyone , Esther , they’re not giving that power to everyone . </s>
“Evil” was Google’s term , we didn’t set the terms of this debate , the Intelligence Squared people didn’t set the terms of this debate . Google set the terms of this debate , by putting that grand proposition out there . “Don’t be evil.” Some of the things they’re doing , they themselves know aren’t right . </s>
They themselves would prefer not to be censoring search results in China , and they have allied themselves with other corporations into a new consortium that is— And they’ve pledged themselves to try to lift this restriction , over the coming years . Now , they’re to be respected for that , as they are to be respected for all of the other enlightening things that the other side keeps pointing out they are doing . But it’s not a proposition about on aggregate , are they 10 percent more good than they are evil . </s>
The question is , do they violate—“violate” is an active verb , that’s a—we won’t—okay , let’s not parse . Do they violate their “Don’t be evil” motto and I just repeat that the construction of censorship tools is an act of evil . </s>
Thank you . Okay , the motion in this Intelligence Squared US debate is , “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto , ” and summarizing his position against the motion is Jeff Jarvis , Director of the Interactive Journalism program at the City University of New York’s Graduate School of Journalism . Jeff Jarvis . This debate , I believe , is not about Google , it is about us . </s>
And it is perhaps a bit of an indictment of us . </s>
You know , the problem we have in America is that we love and nurture success until you become too successful . </s>
And when you become too successful we become suspicious of you , we even wonder whether you couldn’t do this any other way besides being…evil . </s>
Perhaps you do it by being smart , by being good , by being generous . By being innovative . </s>
I think that’s what Google has done here , those are all virtues , and our risk , as a nation , by looking the gift geek in the mouth… not a pleasant visual I’ll admit— …is that we lose this lesson and we lose this value and we lose this tremendous gift , that Google gives us . </s>
Finally , because I am a fan of Google , I am a fan of the wisdom of the crowd . I believe , you are wise . So I am confident , that you will vote against the motion . </s>
Thank you , Jeff Jarvis , and finally , summarizing his position , for the motion , Siva Vaidhyanathan , Associate Professor of Media Studies and Law at the University of Virginia , Siva . Lucifer did not fall because he wanted to be bad . Like Jessica Rabbit he was drawn that way . in fact he fell… He fell because he was trying to be great . </s>
Now , I firmly believe that companies should be companies . That governments should be governments . That saints should be saints , that sinners should be sinners , that gods should be gods , and devils should be devils . The claims of corporate responsibility are basically , cyclical marketing ploys , disguised , disguised as something great and good . The fact is Google grew as big and successful as it has , not only because it is great , and it is…but because it claimed to be good . </s>
Google never bought a Super Bowl ad , to my knowledge , Google never bought an ad . </s>
Right ? </s>
Google got big because in the early days , a whole lot of us who were very active on the web were disgusted by the status quo and we gravitated to Google not only because it seemed to satisfy our needs , but because it satisfied our need to avoid evil and the evil in those days was number one , Microsoft , and number two , Yahoo . And in both cases , Google was able to get—gain our loyalty . It was a cynical marketing ploy , one that in the long run , it will not and in fact has not lived up to . People really believed it was not evil , many people still believe it does not do evil . The fact is companies should make money , and the rest of us should beware . </s>
So please vote for the proposition . Thank you , Siva Vaidhyanathan , and I’d just like to ask for a round of applause as we conclude the talking portion of the debate . So now we come to the moment where you decide how this all turns out , we are going to ask you to vote on the motion which I will restate once again . </s>
“Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto.” Turn to the keypads by your side , if you agree with the motion…push number 1 , if you disagree number 2 , if you remain undecided , push number 3 , and we’re gon na have the results actually hurried down in just a moment and as they’re tallied , I would like to point out a few things that are coming up on Intelligence Squared . Our final debate of the— Our final debate of the fall season…as you’ve jumped ahead on— jumped ahead of me on… It’s Tuesday , December 2nd , our final debate , with the motion , “Bush 43 is the worst President of the last 50 years.” Panelists for the motion are Simon Jenkins , a columnist for The Guardian , and former editor at the Times and London Evening Standard , and Jacob Weisberg , who is chairman and editor-in-chief of the Slate Group . </s>
Against the motion , Bill Krystal , editor of The Weekly Standard and op-ed columnist for the New York Times , and Karl Rove , former senior advisor and deputy chief of staff for George W. Bush . This is all your way of reminding the radio audience that we are in New York City . This debate will be broadcast on BBC World News Television , and to accommodate this particular taping we will be moving for this debate to the Symphony Space Theater which is at 95th and Broadway , and for more information you can visit our website . </s>
I would also like to announce the dates and motions for our spring 2009 season . </s>
January 13th , “Major Reductions in Carbon Emissions Are Not Worth the Money , ” February 3rd , “The Art Market is Less Ethical Than the Stock Market”— March 17th , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , ” April 21st , “It is Wrong to Pay for Sex , ” May 12th , “Diplomacy with Iran is Going Nowhere.” All of the spring debates will be held here again at the Casprey Auditorium at Rockefeller University , with the exception of the first debate on January 13th , that is the carbon debate , that will also be held at the Symphony Space Theater and tickets are still available through the website . All of our debates can be heard on more than 150 NPR stations around the country , and you just need to check with your local NPR station listings for the dates and times of the broadcast . And copies of books by our panelists are on sale in the lobby as well as DVD’s , and now , the moment of truth . </s>
The motion before us was , “Google Violates its ‘Don’t Do Evil’ Motto.” Coming in , 21 percent of you were for the motion , 31 percent were against , and 48 percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , 47 percent of you agree with the motion . 47 percent of you are against the motion , and 6 percent were undecided . 47 percent to 47 percent looks like a tie , however , the side that changed most minds is the side for the motion , who moved 26 percent of you . Versus ... Versus 16 percent for the side against . Thank you to our panelists and thank all of you for joining us . </s>
At the moment , our debaters are coming down toward the stage so I just wan na ask you for a round of applause for all of them . And may I introduce the founder and CEO of Intelligence Squared US , Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Well , we’re nothing if not timely , uh , there was an eight-column headline in today’s New York Times . Quote , “Two gunmen kill man , 19 , and wound four people in a Brooklyn hair salon.” </s>
We all remember the headlines around the Virginia massacre . It’s not headline news , but some 17,000 suicides are committed with guns every year in America . So gun control has a very powerful emotional appeal . And in New York you can sort of have the idea that only gun nuts are opposed to control . So what is the debate about tonight ? </s>
Where is the case for guns reducing crime ? It really lies in two ideas , it’s the idea that guns can prevent crimes , if people have guns at home or in their cars they can prevent crimes by firing a warning shot , by simply announcing I’ve got a gun , and those are very undramatic incidents , they’re not reported in the newspapers . But , they’re real and they happen every day . Crimes can be deterred by the prevalence of guns . </s>
In the United States it’s very unusual for robbers to come into homes that are occupied . In Britain it’s much more common . And the reason is that guns in the home can act as a real deterrent . </s>
In another context of course there’s a Constitutional right to bear arms . </s>
And that’s not just a sort of historic anomaly . It really reflects a basic , natural law , idea of self- defense . And people who have taken the trouble to train themselves and to use guns properly in their self-defense , this is a very , very important right for them and something that they hold onto with a great deal of emotional force as well . But , tonight we’re trying to transcend emotion , we’re really trying to see whether gun control keeps guns away from criminals , or whether it allows the criminals to have a monopoly of gun power . </s>
Whether the preventive effects and the deterrent effects of guns in the hands of a law-abiding populace actually make us safer . Or , are the costs involved in these gun accidents and rampages and suicides that we all see in the headlines , is that the dominant factor in our thinking about gun policy . </s>
So with that kind of framing of the debate I’m really happy to hand the evening over to John Donvan , our moderator from ABC News , and the terrific panel that we’ve assembled tonight . Thank you for being here . Thank you , and I would just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz who makes all of this possible for us . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to Intelligence Squared US , Oxford-style debating brought to America’s shores . I’m John Donvan of “ABC News Nightline.” </s>
On this stage tonight as your host and more importantly your moderator for another in our series of smart and sparkling debates on topics that matter . The motion before us in this program here at the Caspary Auditorium of the Rockefeller University in New York—the motion before us , “Guns reduce crime.” </s>
Which may sound counterintuitive , but that actually depends on how this debate goes , and it may actually sound intuitive , again depending on how the debate goes . We are joined also on this stage by two teams of debaters , of three members each , each of them superbly qualified to be taking part in this discussion . You are also a part of the evening , in that this is a contest , it is a contest of persuasion . These debaters are here to influence your views , to try to change your minds if you disagree with their position . It is a contest of logic and wit and charm and humor but mostly it is a contest of the power of ideas . </s>
In order to gauge and include your participation , we are going to poll you twice during the evening , once in a moment , and once at the end of the debate , in order to see where you stand on this motion that guns reduce crime . So at this point , we would like each of you to turn to the number pads at your seats , and indicate your agreement , disagreement , or lack of decision , over this proposition , the proposition before us that guns reduce crime . While you’re doing that I wan na point out the shape of the evening . Each of the debaters will have opening statements . </s>
Those statements will last seven minutes and it will be timed by us in this way— at the one-minute mark , when they have spoken six minutes and have seven minutes—one minute to go , they will hear a tone , a warning tone that sounds like this . That means they can talk and talk and talk . It— Did you all hear that ? Clearly ? At the seven-minute mark when time is up , the same tone will sound except it will be more persistent , more like this . </s>
And it will continue to do that until the speaker— stops—talking . </s>
After the opening round , our second round will be a head-to-head debate in which the debaters will debate among themselves , and also will take questions from me and questions from you , the audience . I encourage you to be critical in the way you listen , and critical in the way you ask questions , because once again , you are the judges of this evening , you will decide the winners of this debate . And then at the end of the debate once again we will poll you to see where we stand on the numbers . </s>
There will be a two-minute summary statement by each debater to wrap up the event and at that point we will announce the winners based on your judgment . So with that said , let the debate begin . Only rarely does a man of ideas witness in his own lifetime , the opportunity to actually see one of his ideas change history . For a scholar who wrote a controversial book in the 1990s , arguing that , where there is more gun ownership there is actually less crime , that history-making experience took place . </s>
Legislatures across the country took hold of the ideas in that book , and passed laws allowing for the carrying of concealed weapons , that indeed was history-making . The author of that idea and of the book that contained those ideas , is our first debater tonight , speaking for the motion , “Guns reduce crime , ” John Lott . </s>
Well , thank you very much , I appreciate Mr. Rosenkranz putting this on and it’s an honor to be invited here and the introduction was overly generous . But guns cause bad things to happen and makes—and guns make it easier for bad things to happen . But guns also make it easier for people to protect themselves and prevent bad things from happening . Guns make it easier for you to harm somebody , but guns also make it easier for you to deter criminals from attacking to begin with , and turn out to be the most effective way for somebody to go and defend themselves when they’re having to face a criminal by themselves . </s>
It’d be great if police were there all the time , my research finds that police are probably the single most important factor for reducing crime . </s>
But I think one thing the police understand themselves is they virtually always arrive on the crime scenes after the crime’s occurred . And the question you have to ask is what do you advise someone having to do , when they’re having to confront a criminal by themselves ? </s>
Even if they’re able to call 911 , you know , fast response times are measured in eight or nine or 10 minutes . And that can be a lifetime for many people . </s>
I think , as Mr. Rosenkranz was mentioning to begin with , a lot of people have a pretty good idea of the bad things that happen with guns . He mentioned the number of suicides . But you also have , if you look at surveys done by the Justice Department you’ll find maybe about 400-450,000 crimes are committed each year with guns . By contrast , you have similar types of surveys that indicate that people use guns defensively about 2 million times a year . </s>
So about four to five times more frequently people use guns to stop crimes than guns are used in the commission of crime . And yet , I assume for exactly the reasons why Mr. Rosenkranz mentioned earlier , people are if anything like to guess the opposite . I mean if you have—if you’re the editor of a newspaper and you have two crimes that you’re talking about , one , there’s a dead body on the ground , sympathetic person like a victim , and another case where a woman’s brandished a gun , the would-be criminals run away , no shots are fired , no dead body on the ground , it’s pretty obvious which story’s gon na be considered much more newsworthy . </s>
Now , we all want to try to take guns away from criminals . I mean one thing that’s been tried many times is to go and have gun bans . The problem is that when you go and pass something like that , the question you have to ask yourself many times is who’s most likely to obey the rule . If it turns out that it’s the most law-abiding citizens who obey the rule and turn in their guns , relative to the criminals , you can actually see increases in violent crime . </s>
And Washington D.C. is one important example of that . In 1976 , September of ’76 , D.C. passed a ban banning handguns , it didn’t go into effect until February , uh , ’77 . </s>
Uh , but only once after ’76 was D.C.’s murder rate as low as it was in ’76 . Only twice in two years after that was D.C.’s robbery rate as low as it was in ’76 . </s>
And D.C.’s crime rate not only went up relative to what it was in the past , D.C.’s crime rate went up relative to neighboring states , it went up compared to the United States as a whole , it went up relative to other large cities . Here’s a graph that shows you for the top 50 cities of the United States , in 1976 , D.C. was about 18 percentage points higher than the other 49 cities in the top 50 . You can see after that , it keeps on going up , and if I were to have it in ’88 , it even soars dramatically past that , but you can see , it’s about 90 percent higher when you get to 1987 , the rate was falling before the ban , relative to other cities and rising dramatically afterward . It’s not just D.C. though . </s>
In Chicago , Chicago’s murder and robbery rates were falling prior to the 1982 ban , and they rose afterwards , they rose relative to other cities . </s>
One other way I can just mention for D.C. here , D.C. was 15th of the top…50 cities prior to the ban . In half the years after the ban , it was either number one or number two , and it was number four another four years , so two-thirds of the time after the ban , it was one of the top four cities . </s>
It was nowhere even close to that prior to the ban going into effect . It’s just not in the United States . Worldwide , time after time—and it’d be interesting to have people try to show an example where this isn’t true—when you pass bans you see increases in violent crime rates . The UK , here’s an illustration from The Economist a few years ago . </s>
They’d banned handguns in January ’97 . Robbery rates , armed robbery rates were falling up until the time the ban went into effect , and they rose afterwards , if you’d continue this graph they’d continue to go up . You’ve had a 340 percent increase since the ban went into effect and the rate at which people are harmed by guns . You look at Ireland , Jamaica— I mean one thing is , people go and say well the reason why the Chicago and D.C. bans didn’t work is because it’s so easy to go and get access to guns in other places . </s>
Well here you have ideal situations , you have island nations , where it’s relatively easy and go and enforce the borders and protect them . And yet they’ve seen huge increases in the numbers of illegal guns , because essentially all of them are illegal after these bans go into effect . And yet just as we see here in the UK if you look at Ireland or Jamaica or other places , you see time after time increases in robbery and murder rates and violent crimes . Now one thing people often do is they look across countries and they say well , look , England has a relatively low gun ownership rate , it has a relatively high murder rate even if their violent crime rate is twice what we are in the United States . </s>
And they may point to Japan or Germany or other countries , and they say the United States has more guns , more violent crime . But the thing they have to take into account is these other countries had much , much lower violent crime rates prior to bans going into effect . In 1900 for example in England , in London , a city of millions of people , with no gun regulations , you had two gun murders , and five armed gun robberies that took place . </s>
And , what you see time after time when these bans go into effect , either violent crime rates no longer drop , or they begin to start to go up , as you’ve seen in England and other countries . Probably one of the most controversial things we could talk about are gun-free zones that we have in the United States for things like schools or other places . And we hear about these things , they , they dominate the news . </s>
But yet one fact doesn’t go out , you can not find one of these multiple-victim shootings in the United States that occur , that takes place in—where more than three people are killed , that doesn’t take place in a gun-free zone where civilians are banned from owning guns . You want to make places safer . Banning guns you think are the easy solution to that . But again if you pass a ban and it’s the law-abiding good citizens who obey the ban and not the criminals , rather than making it safe for the would-be victims you may unintentionally make it safe for the criminals who are intent on trying to harm others and make less for them to worry about , thank you . Thank you , John Lott . </s>
One of the safest major cities in the United States is Seattle , thanks in great measure to the work done by its police force , under the leadership of a chief who has led the city to a 40-year low in violence . </s>
That said , problems persist there as everywhere else , especially among young offenders , a point brought home to the Chief of Police in Seattle , after , in an anecdote he shared with us , he was doing some after- Christmas day shopping at a mall and when he returned to his car it had been broken into , and the one item stolen from his car was his gun . It’s firsthand experience , and , certainly of everyone on our panel , no one has more actual firsthand experience dealing with guns and crime than the Chief of Police of Seattle , Gil Kerlikowske . </s>
Thank you , John , thank you . Well , it’s a pleasure to be here with you , I was worried that they wouldn’t bring that story out and I wanted to make sure that I did full disclosure and… ‘course I also appreciate the Seattle-like weather during the last couple days . Let me give you a perspective from a police chief’s point of view . </s>
First of all you have to understand that the position of police chief is not , whether it’s Ray Kelly , the great police commissioner in New York City , myself or others , we all actually worked our way up through the ranks . A puff of white smoke didn’t emanate from City Hall and suddenly we became anointed with these positions . All of us worked as police officers and detectives and sergeants , et cetera , so we kind of understand some of the nitty-gritty , although the television shows here in New York are so much better . The right to—in Seattle we’d have latte stories or something . </s>
But the right to own and possess a gun in this country isn’t a debatable issue and it’s not the topic . Reasonableness though , and common sense do come into play . </s>
I’m not a researcher and I am certainly not going to play a researcher for this debate tonight , but I do want to cite a couple things because it provides a framework for you , but it also puts into my perspective 36 years of law enforcement experience . This is work done by Phil Cook . </s>
So the rates of assault , robbery and rape will not noticeably be affected by more guns . Increase in the secondary market of guns , will occur . What is it in the secondary market ? </s>
Loans to and from family members of firearms , off-the-book sales , meaning that there was no background check . </s>
Thefts of guns which , it was mentioned , I am personally familiar with . The percent of suicide with guns is highly correlated with the prevalence of gun ownership , and the murder rate in large counties is closely linked to gun prevalence . </s>
An increase in the gun murder rate would be expected , but there was no effect on the non-gun murder rate . </s>
So you’re going hear from the other side about the deterrence effect , and in fact John already brought a little bit about that up . More people carrying more guns will deter criminals . </s>
In other words the criminals will think twice before confronting a potential victim . </s>
I wish criminals were that smart . On the other hand I’m glad that they’re not that smart , because that’s why we catch so many of them all the time . </s>
Since we have almost , in the neighborhood of 240 million guns in the United States , I would think that these criminals would already get the message that there are a lot of guns out there and that if deterrence was in fact carried through that we would’ve seen it by now , but we haven’t . The other side of this coin is , will more armed citizens have an opposite effect on criminals . In other words , are the criminals going to now arm themselves thinking that more and more and more people are carrying guns . Well , the union that represents the British bobbies , who have been unarmed since Sir Robert Peel founded them , their union went forward and said look , we do not want to be armed as bobbies in the UK . Now this was during a time of significant increases in crime , increases in knife crime which is still going on . </s>
But they asked not to be armed . Now there are some specialized units certainly , called armed response cars , et cetera . But for the vast majority of the bobbies in all of the UK they are not armed and they don’t want to be because , one , they think it will only increase assaults on themselves , and that it will be a tit-for-tat or a proliferation of guns in the UK . Which like rabies they have very few of . </s>
Who is carrying a gun now in this country in the United States , well of course law enforcement officers , state , federal , local . And , security guards , security guards across all walks of life from banks to armored-car services , literally hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people that are already carrying guns . </s>
And then there’s a whole ‘nother group of people , and those are the people that are able to go into their states , and ask for a concealed firearms permit . There is a background check , it depends on the state , on what’s done . </s>
But essentially they say look , I sell jewelry or I have a business that’s been robbed , or , you know what , I want to be able to carry a gun like in Florida . And they’ll be able to carry a firearm as a concealed firearm . Here’s the big unknown , here’s where research has not actually answered this question . </s>
All of these hundreds of thousands of cops out there and security guards and citizens who have concealed firearms permits , how many are actually carrying a gun ? They may have the permits , they may have the authority . </s>
When you’re a new police officer , you’re usually armed to the teeth , and within a few days or months or years or whatever , you oftentimes don’t carry a gun . It used to be that you were required in police departments across the country to be armed whenever you were out and about , off-duty or on . </s>
Very few departments have those rules anymore . Because the gun is difficult to conceal , it is uncomfortable and it is difficult to secure . So when we think of all the people that are actually out there , how many are actually armed . </s>
We don’t know . Now whenever somebody gives you a simple solution to a complex problem , we all know that you can be assured of one thing , it’s wrong . And so after all of the different campus shootings that we have talked about and read about , just recently of course in Arkansas , we hear this hue and cry , well , the students should be armed , or the students and the faculty should be armed . </s>
And the outcome as one academic told me , there is one sure outcome of arming the college students and that would be grade inflation . The last thing that I’ll mention—let me close with this . When I was a young officer , working the street in St. Petersburg -- retired people , a lot of them from New York in fact -- a young woman , 15 years old , intoxicated , beating and beating and beating on the front door of an elderly couple who had no phone . They became more and more and more afraid , but she had been there beating on the door . He turned to the thing that he felt could protect him the most , even though she was unable of course to get in , and she was just really an intoxicated kid beating on the front door . </s>
He fired through the door and struck her . A girl about the age that his granddaughter could or would have been . </s>
And I remember going to the hospital and seeing her there , and I remember the family that lived , that husband and wife in St. Petersburg for many , many years . There are lots of cases in which these guns could protect you , there are far more cases in which the gun does not . Thank you . Thank you , Gil Kerlikowske , arguing against the motion . </s>
Not many lawyers get to argue before the Supreme Court ever in their careers , much less get to bat .1000 </s>
when they do so . </s>
As a lawyer representing the National Rifle Association , Stephen Halbrook has gone 3-for-3 before the Supreme Court in arguing firearms cases on behalf of the NRA . He is on our stage tonight to argue in this debate for the motion , “Guns reduce crime.” Stephen ? Thank you , John . Thank you . </s>
It’s a real pleasure to be here , I think one of the remarks that Gil just made , shows the difference between our country and England , historically , not just today . Our country was founded when the British government had a policy of colonialism in which it sought to exploit the Americans , to tax them without representation , and when the Americans protested there was an escalation , and the British sought to disarm the Americans that led to violence , because the Americans thought this is our only chance to protect ourselves . When you look at a debate topic like this , “Guns reduce crime , ” for and against , let’s define our terms a little bit , guns possessed by who . </s>
Guns possessed by law-abiding citizens reduce crime but not guns possessed by criminals , and , what does crime mean , we look at the term crime I think in a—we should look at it in a very broad way . </s>
Crime means the unjust aggression against life , liberty , and property , of another person . So crime can be committed ... singly by one person against another or , in small groups by a gang of criminals against another . Or at the highest level it can be committed by governments . When we look at the problem of genocide , the problem of crimes against humanity , these are major crimes involving large populations frequently in which guns are used unjustly and there’s an ability to do that on behalf of authoritarian or police states because the population is disarmed . </s>
So , when we look at this issue we should look at not just here and now , what happens in the United States , or what’s happened in the last decade or two , or what happens today , but look at it historically in terms of what sorts of societies have existed historically and which ones have balance and democracy and republicanism and which ones are the kinds of states that you don’t wan na live in , Nazi Germany , Uganda under Idi Amin or Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge , I mean—this is real . We live in a society that’s very nice right now , it’s not guaranteed that it’ll always be that way , either , in terms of your own personal life or in terms of the possibility that a government could turn bad . </s>
What I think we’re advocating tonight , those of us on the side of the proposition , is that you should have freedom of choice to protect yourself if you decide to do that . One of the questions that was asked recently in the US Supreme Court , the District of Columbia was trying to defend its handgun ban and they said that it’s okay to ban handguns and that all guns should have trigger locks and be disassembled and never loaded . And one of the Supreme Court justices asked the question , well what if you hear the door crash in and you’re fumbling for your reading glasses and trying to turn on the lamp and your hands are trembling…maybe it would be a good idea to have a gun available if something like that happened so , the question is not whether everybody should have a gun , but the question is should you have the ability to exercise that freedom of choice if you are a responsible citizen , and that’s your decision to do so . Our American Revolution proved the ability of an armed populace basically to defeat a tyranny and that’s why we ended up in our Bill of Rights with the right of the people to keep and bear arms , the declaration that it shall not be infringed , and also a declaration in favor of a militia because that enhanced the security of a free state , security means that a free state is preserved as a viable political entity , it has republican institutions and people themselves are able to dissuade tyranny , they’re able to fight individual criminals . It was always considered to be a responsibility of individuals to , in the ancient hue and cry and the watch and ward , to , if criminals were on the loose , to try to catch them . </s>
And now we have degenerated somewhat into a society , where you don’t help anybody , and we have many instances where criminals are attacking people and nobody basically gives a damn . So…basically it comes back to freedom of choice , I’d like to use a couple of maybe legal cases , to illustrate the point . </s>
You’ve heard D.C. became the murder capitol of the United States after it enacted a handgun ban . </s>
There’s no duty of the police to protect you , it’s not just impossible for them to do so , it’s not a legal duty . Right before the handgun ban in D.C. was enacted , there were three women who were in a boarding house , and they were broken into . And there were two individuals who , over a period of many , many hours , raped and robbed and otherwise assaulted them . </s>
They called 911 several times , and the police would come knock on the door and nobody would respond . The police would drive by the house , because these ladies made repeated calls to 911 . And so this ordeal , this nightmare finally ended , and they sued the DC government . </s>
And the courts ruled that there is no duty of government to protect any individual person . They have a duty to society at large , which is just kind of a useless concept when you 're an individual and you 're a crime victim . </s>
So there’s no duty to protect you . And then the question becomes , well , maybe you would like to protect yourself . Maybe you would like to at least have the legal right to do that . And that’s what the second amendment is partly intended to guarantee . That’s what the Supreme Court just held in DC versus Heller that we do have an individual right to keep and bear arms . </s>
And it’s a right . It’s not something you have to do . It’s not a duty . But it’s something that you can do . I represented a group of litigants in a companion case , and they live in the ghetto in DC , they 're victims of robberies , house break-ins . </s>
This happened repeatedly . And they were good citizens , and they simply wanted access to guns . The same thing could be illustrated in Hurricane Katrina where the police chief announced no law abiding citizen could have guns , and basically they , the police themselves disarmed individual citizens . And we see the result of that . But if you went across the river into Algiers , the community known as Algiers , citizens armed themselves , they provided their own arms , and they kept violence down , they kept looting down . </s>
The same thing happened in the LA riots , and the same thing happened in Hurricane Andrew in Florida . There was no police protection , no national guard protection for several days . Armed citizens came forward and basically made sure that there was no looting , and no robberies , and no murders proceeding . So , the bottom line is , we don’t have the same system as England . You did n't hear Gil announce that the Seattle police force should disarm themselves . </s>
To the contrary , we should have armed police forces , and we should have that right to be exercised by individual citizens . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Stephen Halbrook . </s>
We are halfway through our opening section of opening statements . And for people who may just be joining the radio broadcast , or who came in late , I 'm going to say the following . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News , and this is Intelligence Squared US , Oxford style debating brought to American shores . We have six panelists on the stage , three for , and three against the motion “Guns Reduce Crime.” </s>
We are halfway through our opening statements , and now let’s let the debate continue . We are all wise enough in the ways of the world to know that the statement “statistics never lie” is a lie . The point being that honest scholars can look at the same numbers and disagree profoundly about what they mean . </s>
We heard from John Lott , whose specialty is looking at the statistics of gun crime . We are now going to be hearing from John Donohue , who is also a numbers man , but who looks at the numbers and comes up with dramatically different points of view on guns and crime . </s>
And through the academic journals , the two John’s have something of a feud going . If you want to look up the journals -- some of which we may touch on tonight . But introducing you , as our next speaker , against the motion “Guns Reduce Crime , ” John Donohue . </s>
Thank you very much , it’s a great pleasure to be with you tonight . Well you mention a feud , I am a peaceful man , but let me just say that everything that you’ve heard from John in terms of the statistical claims are subject to serious challenge and refutation . Quickly , on the DC handgun ban issue , keep in mind that it was a DC handgun ban . You could still have a shotgun in your home . </s>
So if you needed to be protected in your home… The only thing that they were trying to take away was handguns , because those are the guns most preferred by criminals . But , if you look at the numbers that John had put up , which was interesting , if he had actually showed you the number of murders in DC , they had actually dropped . He showed you the rate . </s>
And what was interesting about that was , DC was de-populating tremendously in the seventies , and it was largely the flight of the affluent . </s>
So , the group that had the lowest likelihood of engaging in crime . So , crime was going to be , if you used the rates that John showed , it was going to be trending up , because the people remaining in the city had a much , much higher risk of crime . And so , when you make those adjustments , the conclusions are opposite to what John suggested . If you went for a number of years you’d see there was a huge run up in crime in DC , as there was in Chicago , and Philadelphia , and New York for that matter . But it had nothing to do with the topic we’re talking about . </s>
That was crack cocaine , which had a tremendous criminogenic influence on crime . The final thing to mention about DC handgun ban , is whatever it says about that particular experience , remember , DC is right across from Virginia , where there are plenty of guns . </s>
So , the story that John tries to tell you may tell you something about gun control in that urban environment , but it’s not a story about the value of guns . Everyone concedes that guns in the hands of the right person at the right time can reduce crime . That 's why , as we heard , armed police and security guards are a good thing . </s>
If you go to a maximum security prison , the prison guards don’t have guns , because there are times when guns are good , and there are times when guns are bad . Prison guards , you might think , would want to have guns , but they know those guns would be taken away in a heartbeat by the criminals who are behind bars , so therefore you don’t see it . If you could expand the population in a cautious way to those who are unquestionably law abiding , and a cautious population , sure , there can be benefits there . But , the idea that , John Lott , and you will hear Gary Kleck argue that guns are being used constantly to thwart , um , criminals by these gun- toting citizens is grotesquely misleading . John gave a number , two million . </s>
Gary Kleck has at times said there are two point five million defensive uses of handguns each year . It’s a complete fantasy because gun ownership is so prevalent in this country , criminals know that all they have to do is wait for the family to leave and go to work , or to school , and then they can just walk in and grab the guns . And that happens five hundred thousand to a million times per year . So by virtue of our prevalence of guns , we are giving great aid and comfort to the criminal population , because they can walk in , take those guns . There was a wonderful Sixty Minutes documentary a number of years ago designed to show you how you could protect your house from a burglar . </s>
And they had an active burglar showing how quickly he could get in the house . And when he got in , Mike Wallace asked him , well , what’s the first thing you do when you get in the house ? And he said , look for the guns . They 're gold to criminals , and that’s why they go in and get them . So , whatever benefit we get from scaring off , or even shooting a small number of criminals , it’s offset by the fact that five times as many guns will be handed over to a criminal , in effect , because the criminals will be taking that gun from the previously law-abiding citizen . </s>
Now , John and I have debated on the issue of right to carry laws , laws that say citizens who have not yet been convicted of a felony , or not yet been involuntarily committed to a mental hospital should be allowed to carry a gun wherever they want . John thinks this is a great idea , offers statistics to prove it . </s>
Let me just mention that in Texas , even if you have been committed to a mental hospital , if you can get a note from your doctor , they’ll give you that concealed handgun permit . North Dakota really set a new low . They actually gave one of these permits to a blind permit holder . This is , to be frank , insanity . Now , I published a number of econometric studies , and virtually every top econometrician who has looked at this has sided with me , and not with John Lott . </s>
The National Academy of Sciences convened a panel of talented experts who spent two years looking at John Lott’s work , Gary Kleck’s work . They came before the committee , testified , fifteen to one in that panel of sixteen , they concluded the scientific evidence does not support the more guns , less crime proposition . </s>
The lone dissenter was someone who was not an econometrician , who admitted in his dissent that he wished he knew more econometrics , and who had previously testified as an expert witness on behalf of the NRA . The other fifteen members of the committee responded to his dissent saying , quote , the scientific evidence does not support his position . Let me just note what the NRA tries to tell you about all sorts of things . </s>
This is a picture of something that you can buy on the NRA web site . </s>
It’s a picture showing the Second Amendment . And note the way they drape the gun across the page . It’s obscuring the first half of the Second Amendment which starts off saying “A well regulated militia.” </s>
That’s because they would try to have you believe that was not part of the Constitution , the idea of regulation being very central , because it’s the first phrase in the Constitutional Amendment that they 're talking about . </s>
Now , if the NRA ca n't be trusted to tell you the truth on something that’s been on black and white paper for two hundred years , how likely is it that they 're going to be able to tell you the truth on the complicated issues of evaluating what he impact of these laws are . It’s a complete absurdity to think you 're going to get the true story from the NRA and their close allies . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , John Donohue . When it comes to hot button issues , we like to have easy pigeon holes to put people in . But our next speaker makes it difficult . A professor of criminology at Florida State , he is , let’s see , a Democrat , a member of the ACLU , a member of Amnesty International . </s>
He describes himself as an environmental tree-hugger . However , when it comes to this issue , this classic liberal is defying all expectations by arguing what is normally considered the conservative side . </s>
Gary Kleck , arguing for the motion that “Guns Reduce Crime.” And yes , I 'm going to vote for Barack Obama too . </s>
Thank you , John , and thank you all for coming out on this very nasty night . That is indeed an accurate rendition of my background . The moral of that particular story is , I did n't come to this pro side of this debate via my ideology . It’s the most unnatural thing in the world , from that standpoint . </s>
I did n't come to that position by virtue of my social background . </s>
I grew up in the wilds of suburbia , basically , where guns are scarce . They don’t have guns to commit crimes , they don’t have guns to defend against crimes , they don’t have guns for hunting , they don’t have guns . My way into this position is basically evidence-based . </s>
I 'm boringly scholarly . I’ve been studying this issue for nearly thirty years , I’ve written three books , dozens of articles . </s>
I’ve published more articles on the effects of defensive use of guns than anyone else . Oddly enough , sometimes what you can learn from a debate is by listening to the silences , paying attention to what people would be expected to talk about , but don’t . </s>
Strictly speaking , the other side actually hasn’t addressed the issue of the effectiveness of defensive gun use . </s>
They’ve kind of danced around it , but they have n't actually addressed it head on , and in fact , the organization Paul Helmke represents , the Brady Campaign , previously Handgun Control Incorporated , used to have a very prominent segment of their web site devoted to the proposition that , no , if you try to use a gun for self-protection , you 're going to get yourself killed , or injured , or it’s going to be taken away and used against you . And they’ve more or less stopped talking about it , they 're just silent on the issue . That 's significant . The reason is , the evidence is unanimous , it’s rare in criminological research for the findings to be unanimous on anything , but they 're unanimous on this one . Defensive gun use is effective in the sense that crime victims who use guns during a crime are less likely to be injured or killed , and less likely to lose property than crime victims who adopt any other kind of strategy , including non-resistance . </s>
Non-resistance is not the safest course of action . And this is so despite the fact that usually when people try to use guns for self-protection , they 're doing it under tougher circumstances . They do it not because they 're quick on the trigger , but because they 're facing really desperate circumstances , they 're likely to be outnumbered , they 're likelier to be facing offenders with weapons , including guns , than other victims . They 're more likely than other victims to have already been injured . </s>
And out of desperation , with all of these handicaps against them , then they use guns in an attempt to defend themselves , and from that point on they are not hurt . Much of the research that previously claimed that , if you tried to use a gun you’d only get hurt , it had a simple error in the research that everybody here can understand . </s>
It was an error in terms of what happened first . Researchers would report that there were many incidents in which people were injured , and they used guns defensively . What they did n't know , and it turned out once the error was corrected in the research , those were always cases where somebody was first injured , and then used the gun for self protection . It wasn’t using the gun that got them hurt , it was getting hurt that finally pushed them into using the gun . When they fixed that flaw in the research , they basically found that once people used guns for self protection , they are almost never injured after that point . </s>
There’s good reason why the chief’s police officers carry guns . They 're effective for self protection , but it does n't require the unique training and experience of police officers for it to be effective . </s>
It’s effective basically for everybody . You may not have noticed , but there’s actually more consensus among the six of us than might be evident at first . I don’t think anybody really disputes the proposition that the effects of guns depends on who has them . </s>
I have n't heard anybody on the other side say that guns in the hands of non-criminals are just as bad in the hands of criminals . It makes a huge difference . Basically , guns in the hands of non-criminals , or in the hands of victims , regardless of any prior criminal behavior , reduce violence . They reduce it in the sense that , once the gun is introduced by the victim , the offender stops aggressing . </s>
Period . Furthermore , defensive gun use is extremely common , contrary to Professor Donohue’s claims , it’s not sheer fantasy that leads us to believe that there are on the order of two million defensive gun uses a year . </s>
It’s simply probability sampling surveys of the same sort that Gallop and Harris and every major survey organization uses . You just ask people questions . You 're not going to hear about these defensive gun uses from your newspaper , nor are the police going to hear about them because frankly , if you had been a crime victim who used a gun for self protection in a typical situation , you’d be insane to report it to the police . And of course if the police don’t hear about it , neither will your local newspapers . </s>
At best , maybe you’d be arrested for unlawful possession of a firearm , because most of these uses occur in public places where you 're not supposed to have a gun , unless you have a special carry permit . </s>
At worst what can happen is you can be arrested for the , the assault itself , a criminal assault . It may well be somewhere down the road , after you’ve gone through a legal nightmare , that you 're cleared of these charges , but in the meanwhile you can be bankrupted from the legal expenses , and have your reputation ruined , and nobody reads it on page eighteen that , oh yeah , you know , Joe Smith was cleared of those charges . </s>
So you 're not going to hear about it from police statistics , yet scientifically conducted , objectively conducted surveys have , in at least twenty consecutive surveys , found that defensive gun use is not just common , it’s more common than criminal use is . And so that’s not a fantasy , as Professor Donohue would have you believe , it’s about as firmly established a fact as we have to go on in this area . Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you , Gary Kleck . </s>
Another defier of easy pigeon-holing is the man who is President of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence , an organization that is the forefront of the gun control movement . He is a Republican , and he is the former Mayor of Indianapolis . He has said that his position on gun control had a lot to do with nearly losing two close friends in a gun accident . This was during the time when they were all teenagers together . </s>
Now , all of these years later , we are pleased to introduce as our final speaker , and speaking against the motion that “Guns Reduce Crime , ” Paul Helmke . It’s great to be here tonight . I 'm , just for the record , I was Mayor of Fort Wayne , Indiana , not Indianapolis , but another great city in the state of Indiana . </s>
I came to this issue as a mayor . Not only had I had the experience , when I was a teenager , of seeing a friend get a bullet in the back because of the all too common incident of , we found a gun , we did n't know it was loaded , which happens every day in this country . </s>
But as a mayor , I saw what happens in a community when there are so many guns , and when we make it so easy for dangerous people to get guns . I had police officers , one case I still remember well , I got the call in the middle of the night from the police chief , our labor relations director , a police chief , married to a police officer , they kept a gun at their headboard . </s>
They wanted to be safe . They knew how to use the gun . They were police officers . They had a fight , domestic quarrel . She ended up dead . </s>
That happens a lot in this country . Actually , the statistics show that if you’ve got a gun in your home , it’s twenty-two times more likely to be used against you or a family member than to protect you . Think about that again . Twenty-two times more likely . And part of the reason is that the world does n't easily divide into the good guys and bad guys , because there’s always sort of a chance that any of us can get angry , any of us can get drunk , and if the gun is there , what’s going to happen with that gun ? </s>
When you look at the arguments for the proponents here , basically they talk about these two million defensive uses , and as Professor Donohue said , that’s a questionable number . Yes , it was based on probability sampling . </s>
There were sixty-six people who responded to a poll that said they used a gun defensively . Sixty-six , and then you extrapolate that by the adult population of the US , and you get two million gun uses . Just sixty-six . </s>
When you do sampling and have such a small affirmative number , and then you multiply it by huge things , you get these outrageous things . Based on that , more people have been in flying saucers in this country . It shows what happens with statistics . </s>
Actually , when I was running for Mayor of Fort Wayne , I learned quickly how statistics -- how it works . I was running against an incumbent . I looked at what had happened in crime in my community , and there had been times when crime went up . And so I 'm digging out the statistics . The police chief at one time said , yes , crime was up because the economy was down . </s>
People lost their jobs , they were going to commit crimes . </s>
Then I found another clip from two years later , he said , well , crime is up because the economy is good , more people have things to steal . You can take statistics and do whatever you want with them so many times . The one statistic that does n't lie are deaths . You have to do probability sampling for these other things , but when you look at deaths , you get the shocking statistics . </s>
That thirty-two people are killed with guns , murdered with guns every day in this country . That’s a Virginia Tech happening every day in this country . Thirty thousand people die from guns every year . That includes the suicides and the accidents . </s>
You get the situation like just a couple days ago in Massachusetts , some kid is shooting a machine gun at some gun show , and he kills himself because he ca n't hold it . What is going wrong with this country ? Thirty thousand deaths . </s>
And then when you combine the seventy thousand people that are injured every year , people like Jim Brady , who , by the way , was with President Reagan at the time , surrounded by people with guns , the Secret Service . That did n't stop them from getting shot . Those guns did n't reduce that crime . The other argument that the proponents seem to make , is they 're holding up this straw man of the gun bans , and how gun bans don’t work . </s>
And you can argue the statistics . </s>
Actually , after DC had their hand gun ban , gun suicides went down twenty-three percent , gun homicides went down twenty-five percent when you looked at a ten year period . So , there’s a lot of statistics there . But the real issue is not gun bans . We 're not talking about gun bans , we’re talking about the question , do more guns reduce crime ? </s>
And it’s clear that the more guns you get out there , the more likely those guns are going to be stolen . Where do you think the criminals get these guns ? That these guns are going to be trafficked . Where do you think the criminals get these guns ? </s>
Misused ? Where do you think accidents happen from ? Used in road rage . </s>
Used in the domestic violence situation . It’s the guns that add to the problem . </s>
Other countries in the world have the same level , generally , of rapes , and of burglaries , and of robberies , and of assaults that we do , industrialized countries . But we are far and away the most deadly country when it comes to gun crime , because we have so many guns . In fact , if you think about it for a second , if the proposition were true that guns reduce crime , we should be the safest country in the world , and we’re not . </s>
And it’s because we do have so many guns , and those guns too easily get in the wrong hands . </s>
And actually , when you think about this proposition , rather than voting to say that guns reduce crime , you should stop and think that really restricting access to guns is what would reduce crime . We’re coming up on the fifteen year anniversary of the Brady Bill . </s>
The Brady Bill said , instead of taking an individual’s word whether they 're a felon or mentally dangerous , let’s do a background check . The Brady -- you know , bright idea , right ? Don’t just say , are you a felon ? </s>
No , of course not . You know , it’s a… The Brady Background check system has stopped one point six million people from buying guns who were n't allowed to buy guns . We had a situation just last week in Virginia where somebody went in to buy a gun , turns out there’s a murder warrant for them in Baltimore , and the person got arrested . You know , criminals , like the chief said , are n't always the brightest people in the world . In fact , this guy tried to argue , well , I did n't commit the murder , I would n't have gone and bought a gun if I… It did n't make any sense . </s>
Brady background checks work . If we decide that some people are probably more prone to violence , again , people with a felony record , people that are dangerously mentally ill , let’s stop them from buying those guns , let’s use background checks , let’s have them in all sales , not just from federally licensed dealers . Let’s do things to stop gun trafficking . </s>
Do you realize that you can go in and buy eighty- one of the same make and model of a gun tomorrow , and what do you think is going to happen when someone did that in Charlie Brown’s Gun Store in Dayton , Ohio a few years back , eighty-one of the same make and model ? They sell them out of the trunk of their car . People don’t realize how weak our gun laws are in this country . We basically allow almost anyone to get any kind of a gun . Last thing I wanted to comment on is the Supreme Court case . </s>
The Supreme Court case , while making it clear that gun bans are off the table , made it clear that we can have reasonable restrictions , that we can restrict who gets the guns , where they take the guns , how the guns are sold , how the guns are stored , and what , and all the things that deal with guns . That’s where this debate should come down . I 'm not anti-gun . </s>
I’ve got my NRA pro-marksmanship badge from when I was in sixth grade . </s>
My friends all went hunting and did these things too . But once you see how easy we make it for dangerous people to get guns , you’ll conclude that you should vote against the proposition . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Paul Helmke , and I apologize to the people of Fort Wayne , Indiana . The mistake was mine alone , but I 'm very much reminded of the fact that we are not in Indiana , that we are in New York City , because we have the numbers in . </s>
Polling the audience before the debate on the motion , and we’re going to put them up on the screen now , the motion being “Guns Reduce Crime.” Thirteen percent of you supported this motion before the debate , sixty percent of you opposed the motion , and twenty- seven percent were undecided . We’ll be polling you again toward the end of the debate to see whether any minds have been changed . We’re going to begin the section now , where the debaters address one another and also take questions from you , the audience . And again , I would very much encourage any of you who are here to participate . </s>
If you have expertise in the field , that is so much the better . Again , we would encourage you to keep your questions exceedingly short . What you need to do is raise your hand , and we have ushers who are moving around the aisles , and will come to you , and locate you . But I just want to go to John Lott , who , in a sense , your work embodies this motion that guns reduce crime , and your statistical work embodies that motion . And yet tonight I heard some of the fundamental work you’re done referred to as a fantasy . </s>
And I heard the question raised by former Mayor Helmke , if guns prevent crime , why is n't this the most safe nation in the world ? What is the answer to that , and what about the fantasy issue ? Well , I mean , there are lots of academics that have , I’ll just take the fantasy issue first . There are lots of academics who have looked at the relationship between concealed hand gun laws and crime rates , and if you look at papers published in refereed academic journals by economists and criminologists , you’ll find about seventy percent of them find that when right to carry laws get passed , there’s drops in violent crime rates . About thirty percent say there’s no change that’s there . </s>
And then there’s not one refereed academic journal that I know of that finds that there’s a bad effect from these . So there’s a lot of people that looked at this in many different ways . John , John , you 're ignoring the National Academy of Science Panel— </s>
I 'm happy to— 15 to one , including some of the top econometricians in the country— Right . </s>
—and their conclusion was your work is not supported by the scientific evidence . Not true , we’re experts on it , their opinions on that issue have absolutely nothing to do with it , John’s talking about what experts thought . </s>
But the promise— And the real debate is simply between people who say there is a beneficial effect , versus those who say there’s no effect . </s>
There basically is no , no participation on John’s side , on John Donohue’s side . </s>
Basically there is no support for the view it has counterproductive violence-elevating effects . But just to respond to the National Academy of Sciences , I mean , unfortunately I think , there’s a problem with government getting involved in evaluating research , and it’s very hard for the government to keep politics out of it . </s>
This was a panel set up by the Clinton administration ; I don’t think it was unbiased— This was not a panel set up by the Clinton administration— </s>
It was started there . But the point is , what James Q. Wilson , who’s this hack that you were referring to , and I think a lot of people would regard James Q. Wilson as probably the top criminologist in the country , he was the person who was dissenting on this . </s>
And what…Jim showed , was that if you look at every single one of the National Academy of Sciences estimates on the impact of right-to-carry laws on murder rates , every single one of their own estimates showed that right-to-carry laws reduced murder rates . </s>
And if you looked at their other things , virtually all their other estimates for all the other types of crimes showed reductions in those also— John , I have the report— There was no estimate— I have the report right here— —not one estimate , that the National— </s>
I have the report right in front of me , and it does not support what you just said . Is it true or is it not true that every regression , every estimate that they had on right-to-carry and murder showed a drop . Is there one estimate they showed that it did n't fall ? Yeah— Statistically— </s>
Yeah , there are some , not— maybe not statistically significant , but— But , the bottom line , John , is , as the panel suggested , the elephant in the room was crack cocaine . The states that did not pass the right-to-carry laws were states that had a big problem with crack cocaine which had an enormous influence in running up crime . </s>
Now , that’s— The rural states that did pass these laws did not experience the big run-up in crime , and when you do your analysis , it is the difference between the flat performance in the rural states , and the increases in crime that generates that result . That’s why— That’s simply not true— </s>
—James Q. Wilson was outvoted 15 to 1 . Look— Okay , I—I think we have impasse on this… And I— I wan na go to Chief Kerlikowske , Seattle police chief , because you were talking about British bobbies being unarmed , and preferring that in many situations because they felt being armed would invite assault , and yet Gary Kleck arguing for the motion said why are police armed in the first place unless it is to deter assault , do you—can you take that on ? </s>
Yes I can , and , remember what Truman said , if I could line up all the economists end to end , wouldn’t that be a beautiful sight , so that , I just— And one , and one is on my panel . So…getting away from the statistics and going to that police officers are highly trained with firearms . They practice and qualify , they can’t graduate from the academy with qualifying . Without question , they can use the gun in a defensive mode . </s>
But when you look at the numbers of police officers in the United States and I remember—I can picture every moment to this day , of the first time I had an officer killed in the line of duty . Young , bright , talented , incredible shape , shot 13 times with his own handgun . </s>
Wasn’t a question of training , wasn’t a question of anything else . Officers are routinely wounded and assaulted with their own guns . That’s why— That’s not true , that’s absolutely not true— Officers are routinely assaulted— </s>
It’s an incredibly rare event— Gary—Gary Kleck is— But anyhow— —objecting , but Gary , hold off— </s>
There was a— —— —the entire reason that the entire gun industry made significant changes in holsters . </s>
It used to be that we all wanted the quick- draw holster , how fast could we get the holster out . Now the holsters are designed , they’re cumbersome , they’re heavy , they are not quick-draw and they are designed and sold by the millions across this country for one reason and that is because of officers having the gun taken from them . </s>
Gary—Gary Kleck is— — —Gary Kleck , I just want to remind our radio listeners , Gary Kleck is arguing for the motion , the liberal…who works just from the numbers . You know , here’s a number for you and it’s a very easy number to understand , for the most recent years for which we have data in the entire United States , there was exactly one police officer killed with his own gun , one . </s>
It is—you can stretch the concept “routinely” quite a bit but I don’t think one— </s>
But Gary , how many officers— </s>
—out of 600,000 police officers in the entire United States— But how many were actually shot— —can really be described as routine . That’s , that’s some indication of the chief’s credibility when he says something happens frequently or routinely , one in 600,000 is not routine— But Gary , you left out the number of the number of officers— </s>
And— —actually killed— </s>
—what he fails to point out— —very small— —is that police officers in fact are not assaulted anywhere near as often as civilians , and he’s right , there’s a very straightforward reason , they’re all armed with firearms , and trained . But— </s>
Chief—Chief—let the Chief respond— I mean , actually you’d have to be pretty stupid to assault an armed police officer who has a baton , a uniform , a radio— Indeed you would— —a gun , pepper spray and extra ammunition and is wearing body armor . </s>
That probably is quite correct . But there are very few because of body armor and the changes in body armor in this country , there are very few police officers now killed or wounded in the line of duty , that the number—that the numbers that we used to see . So to say yes , one out of what , but what , 45 officers killed , shot— </s>
There were never many— So the ratio— </s>
There were never many even 20 years ago or 30 years ago before the advent of body armor , it was no more true than now , it’s simply untrue— Yeah , you’re talking about at most five a year or so , even in the high years that that is . Look , five , it’d be better if it was zero but if you look at the number of police officers who are assaulted in a year you’re talking about between 16 and 20,000 . </s>
And so if you’re asking , what’s the rate of a police officer who’s assaulted , who’s going to lose control of his weapon and have it used against him—and going to result in his death , it’s a tiny number , but even more important I think to make is a comparison to civilians , because that’s partly the motivation for this . And police officers have a much more difficult job than civilians do , a police officer can’t brandish a gun , watch the criminal run away , and be satisfied that his job’s over with . </s>
If he has to come into physical contact with the criminal , and you’re much more likely to have something go wrong . One of the benefits a civilian has , if you take a right-to-carry class to get your permit someplace , one of the things they’re going to tell you is you’re not the police . </s>
Your job isn’t to go and arrest people . The benefit that you have of having a gun , is to maximize the distance between yourself and the criminal . If he runs away , that’s basically what you’re done with , and that’s the reason why you had the gun . Paul Helmke— </s>
Yeah , I— —Paul Helmke , as a former mayor of Fort Wayne to whom the police reported , were you surprised to hear Stephen Halbrook , who represents the NRA , say that police do not have a responsibility to protect individuals ? It’s— I think Steve’s playing legalisms with what really happens , I mean the general slogan for most police departments is “To protect and defend.” I mean it’s their job to get out there , now they— But his argument is that— </s>
His argument is that you can’t sue them if they haven’t responded— </s>
His argument really is because the police can’t do it people have to do it for themselves . And let me address that argument , it’s Steve’s argument , at some extent , is true . People do have a right of self-defense . The Supreme Court made that very clear in the Heller case , you know , I do wonder a little bit about Justice Roberts’s comments that he wasn’t , you know , he wanted to be able to shoot his gun but he needed to turn on the light and put on his reading glasses before that , and that’s the example Steve just gave and I thought gee , if the Chief Justice needs to put on his glasses and turn the light on before he can shoot maybe , he shouldn’t be shooting , but— It gets into the issue of , yes , people do have a— </s>
People do have a right of self-defense . But what we do when we live in communities is we set up police departments because they’re the individuals that are trained , they’re the individuals that respond . And often when an individual has a gun in their home , again as I said it’s 22 times more likely to be used against them or a family member . Homes with more guns have more gun violence , cities with more guns have more gun violence , states with more guns , countries with more guns , more gun violence , now that includes gun suicides and gun accidents , not just gun homicides . </s>
And when you talk about police departments—I ran the police department . 20 percent of the time that an officer’s shot it’s his gun or his partner’s , so you’ve got ta expand that to the partner’s gun . 20 percent of the time when an officer’s in a shoot-out situation , they miss their target— Well , you’re running— </s>
—only 20 percent of the time do they hit their target— —into a lot of numbers here , I want to give Stephen a chance to respond , Stephen Halbrook of the NRA— There’s something really bizarre about this picture that citizens with guns are totally incompetent and police with guns are totally incompetent and they’re likely to be taken away from them , but somehow criminals are really good with guns , where— where did they get all this training . </s>
Well , they’re not that good— There’s something bizarre about this picture that , citizens and police can not defend themselves with guns but criminals can successfully use guns to aggress against other people , it doesn’t make—it’s against common sense . I’m not a statistician , I don’t think Paul is either , we’re the two who aren’t here but it just doesn’t make sense to say that you should never be able to protect yourself , that you shouldn’t use a gun , that you’re incompetent , that you’re totally worthless with it and—it’s just , against any common sense . And , the fact that , this is not just a legalism , police have no duty to protect you . </s>
It’s not their fault by the way , of course their slogan is to protect and serve , they want to do that . But they have no legal compulsion to do it and of course even if you could sue them if they didn’t protect you after the kinds of scenarios we talked about , it wouldn’t do you any good , you may be dead or you’re otherwise injured . </s>
You want to be able to prevent the crime from happening . And the only way to do that in some circumstances is you have to be able to protect yourself . </s>
We’re going to go to the audience for some questions , now there are a lot of hands up and what we’re gon na do is pick out… take two or three questions , do the questions first and then we’ll repeat them to the panel , so , why don’t you take that one right there… ? Brief , please . Um— And I’m collecting questions so it’s me and then I’ll relay them . </s>
To the gentlemen…for the motion , if you believe that guns reduce crimes , would you recommend that your children keep a gun handy . Thank you . Down here ? I’ll come back . </s>
Sorry , here ? Yes , I think that we’re conflating statistical data about societies and societal factors with the guns themselves . So I am not clear where you have had a concealed-carry law put into place , within that particular community so you can hold constant for crack use , or non-crack use , rural or urban . </s>
What has been the result , does it reduce crime , does it increase crime , and the other thing that I would appreciate you speaking to , is the word “regulate” in the second amendment , it seems to me that in our history , people regularly had gun ownership and it was not something that was precluded , so addressing that point and how it affected our— Thank you— —opinions would be helpful . Thank you . Right to your left… ? </s>
Hi , I have a very quick question that’s a little bit more specific than just a broad topic . Do you think that gun buy-back programs , help reduce crime and if yes , who evaluates these programs and why are they started in the first place— Okay—thank you , we—those are good , those are all questions and they’re quite good and brief . Should kids have guns to protect themselves , I suppose , what age are you talking about , when would you say— start saying this is a reasonable question to ask . </s>
Um— </s>
Microphone to your mouth . I was really interested , all these gentlemen seem to have—to be old enough to have children over 18 or 21 . Mm-hmm . I was wondering , their own children , would they recommend that their own children— </s>
For self-defense . Not for hunting , not for sport— Yeah— —self-defense . </s>
Gentlemen , any of you support guns for children for self-defense . I hope my kids have guns— </s>
This is John Lott answering . Sorry , John , I spoke over you , go ahead ? </s>
I mean I hope my kids have guns , when they get—I mean I didn’t own a gun until 1996 after I’d started doing the research that I did . As far as I know my family had never owned a gun . But at this point , given that I believe the benefits far outweigh the risks , I think I’d be disappointed if my kids didn’t own a gun . Anybody on the other side respond to that ? I wouldn’t want my daughter to have a gun . </s>
That’s Paul Helmke— </s>
When I look at the statistics about how that adds to the risk of suicide , the risk of being misused , the risk of it coming up , being stolen , used in a domestic quarrel , I think it’s just too much of a risk . John Donahue against the motion . There’s also the social factor that the NRA and our other panelists want to ignore . Sean Penn got the right to carry a concealed handgun in California which is tough to do , went to a Berkeley restaurant for lunch one day , came back , his gun was— his two guns that he had left in his car were gone because the car had been stolen . They got a car back , a few days later , but the two guns were missing , so maybe it might’ve helped him at some point , but now somebody’s got Sean Penn’s guns , and I suspect it’s a criminal— </s>
Okay , we’re a little— —that’s not going to use them very effectively— —we’re a little off the point of the question about children who are—the second question went to whether there are studies that show the impact of a concealed-carry law within a given community actually having had an impact , before that I have a question . How is a concealed weapon a deterrent , to the guy who can’t see it . </s>
Because they don’t know who has it , and if you have a— So the community has it , in other words— If you’re in a state that has mandatory issuance of concealed- weapon permits , then criminals have no knowledge of who might be carrying legally , and you would think there would be more who would carry if it is legal than those who would do it out of desperation because of fear— So people who would not be carrying in that community would also be protected under that theory , because— </s>
Absolutely , because the criminals don’t know who has the gun . </s>
John Lott , you were going answer the question that the questioner put to us— Right— —about whether the , sta—there is a— No , excellent question , actually . And , that’s precisely what you want to do , you don’t want to just compare across places because , you know , Idaho is different than California and England has a different underlying crime rate before they change any types of gun control laws than the United States has . </s>
And so what you’re doing in these tests is , you’re precisely doing that , you’re seeing how crime rates change in a state after that state’s adopted right-to-carry laws , and how that change is comparing to other places that didn’t change their laws over that period of time . </s>
And there are lots of other things you’ll do , you’ll see , as that state issues more permits , you know , is there a greater drop that you see…Stephen Halbrook was just mentioning is the probability that a criminal may come across somebody who’s able to defend themselves , is there some relationship between the increased risk that the criminal faces and , and further drops in crime . But , you know , that’s exactly the way that you want to do the test and all the tests that I do , that’s precisely the type of test— </s>
I’m seeing a great deal of skeptical looks from the opposing table . John— </s>
All the tests that John do— —John Donohue’s taking this— All the tests that John do— </s>
— —show that , crime gets better . But , again , this is exactly what the National Academy of Science looked at . </s>
And , they concluded the opposite , that the data did not— They did not conclude the opposite . They concluded that the data does not support the proposition that we’re debating today which is that guns reduce crime . No , actually what that report— </s>
Gary Kleck— —persistently said was , we don’t have strong enough evidence to draw firm conclusions about virtually every issue they addressed , so , that was more of a no-decision decision than it was reaching the opposite conclusion , they did not reach the conclusion that making it easy to get a carry permit increases crime . They did not conclude that John Lott was wrong , and basically , you know , you learn nothing from what that particular panel said— I— —be—precisely because it was— </s>
—I’ve read the same report and I have to say , Gary , that I read it the same way , actually , it was a bit of a Pontius Pilate moment that didn’t know who was right or who was wrong— </s>
We need more data— Yeah , you kind of read the thing and you ask was this trip really necessary . I mean— One of the things , just real quick on concealed-carry— </s>
Paul Helmke— —The real issue is , who makes the decision on whether you’re getting a concealed-carry permit , and , and the real difference between states are those where it’s a shall-issue or versus may- issue . </s>
And a lot of states as the— You have to explain what shall-and-may means— Yeah , I was going to do that , shall-issue states , it basically , someone fills out a form , sometimes they don’t have to take a class , a lot of times in Utah they don’t even have to live in the state . Sometimes you can just send in a form that says , yes , I listened to a video or whatever , and send— here’s my check , and you get a concealed-carry permit . </s>
In other states it actually goes to the Chief of Police or to the Sheriff , who does a check to see whether you—not only is your record clean but , in terms of the felony conviction , but they check to see are the police responding to your house every week because of domestic quarrels , is this a kid that you’ve had to arrest a number of times on minor things that aren’t going to be a disqualifier . Then the police have some discretion , I had a police chief who turned down somebody for a gun because—he had a clean record , turns out the kid had been acquitted of killing his parents in a neighboring country five years earlier . It was questionable whether he should’ve been acquitted , it was one of those cases . My chief turned him down a few years later when it was easier to get those guns , he ended up killing his brother , brother-in-law , neighbor , with one of his 25 AK-47’s that he kept in the attic , so— It’s give the police a little more discretion on who’s getting these guns . </s>
Right now , 48 of the 50 states have some version of either may issue or shall issue , so it’s hard to make comparisons between states that do and don’t have these things— Let’s bring Chief Kerlikowske also to address the gun buy-back questioner . I will , I think the issue for us is clearly that there has to be far more than being mobile and not being blind as a reason to give someone a firearms permit . And just within the last several months at one of the largest festivals in the city , the Folklife Festival , tens of thousands of people and literally dozens of police officers , officers within spitting distance in fact of the crowd , a young man who had been on methadone , who had had a number of other problems , had a license issued by the Sheriff in a neighboring county , so that he could carry a concealed firearm anywhere . </s>
And in the middle of this crowd he looked at someone , that person looked at him and they got into a fight , the gun went off and it not only discharged across the assailant , the person that he was fighting with -- and all they’d been fighting with were their hands -- the gun also then ended up going through the hand of a young man and into the thigh of another woman . That is a person that should’ve never had a concealed firearms permit . On the issue of gun buy-backs I think the research is pretty clear , does it deter crime , does it result in guns being taken off the street that are crime guns… A lot of times they’re old guns , they’re guns that are not being used in crimes and they’re being found by people cleaning out garages , et cetera . </s>
Taking those guns off the street is not a bad thing , remember a hundred-year- old firearm can kill someone . But I don’t think we see it as a huge issue as far as reducing crime . </s>
John , could you—just one second , I have just a little bit of business I need to do for our radio broadcast , to remind everyone that I’m John Donvan of ABC News and this is Intelligence Squared US , Oxford-style debating , we have six panelists , three for and three against the motion , “Guns reduce crime , ” we are in the head-to-head section of the debate and taking questions from the audience—John Lott . On the gun buy-back issue , I don’t know of one single academic study by any type of academic , that finds that they reduce any type of violent crime rate . We could talk about that more if you want to , but— One question that keeps on coming up here , a point from the other side is that , people with concealed handgun permits , they may do bad things . </s>
And it’s easy to check . </s>
In the state of Washington you’ve had permits being issued since 1960 . </s>
The type of incident that there was , this wounding , is the only case I know like that in the state of Washington , nobody has been convicted of murder for example in Washington that’s had a concealed-carry permit , and you’re talking about almost 50 years . And you see that in state after state . In Florida , you can go to the website for the department that issues permits , and they have detailed data there , you find that , from October 1987 through September 31st of this year , they had issued over 1.41 million permits to 1.41 million people . Of those people , 166 had had their permits revoked for any type of firearms violation . Virtually all those were for one type of violation , that was someone who accidentally carried a concealed handgun into a gun-free zone like an airport or what have you— </s>
It’s interesting that— This is Paul Helmke— </s>
—it’s interesting that Florida’s brought up though , the— —the Sun-Sentinel , did a study in 2006 , before the legislature closed off this website , this is the new move by the way , is that the gun pushers come in and they say we don’t want this information to be public because we don’t want you to know what’s happening with the concealed carry permit holders . But the Sun-Sentinel found 216 people with active warrants , 128 with domestic violence restraining orders , nine people charged with felonies or reckle—or violent reckless demeanors , six red— registered sex offenders , at least one prison inmate , and another 1400 people who had pled guilty or no-contest to felony charges , all had concealed-carry permits in the state of Florida— — </s>
And then—and the Florida legislature , said , we don’t want to make this information public anymore . — </s>
Gary Kleck says that Paul Helmke is leaving something out— But notice what Paul is leaving out of that , you may have been listening for how many people did something with their gun that they are now legally entitled to carry around in public places . How many times did they commit a violent crime in a public place , that’s the oily thing a carry permit allows you to do that you couldn’t do without the permit . In fact , none of those people did a violent crime with a gun in a public place and the fact that they had carry permits had absolutely nothing to do with anything , there was no— </s>
We’re gon na go back to— —there was no harmful consequence— </s>
—questions from the audience while we still have some time— —of them getting those carry permits . </s>
Down in the front , we’ll do three again , as before . Right , my question is for those who are in favor of the proposition . Isn’t there a distinction between a handgun , and a more excessive weapon like an AK-47 , would you have the same attitude toward those more— </s>
Thank you . That’s— I take the point , in the , in the back ? Yes , sir . The question went unanswered earlier , why isn’t the United States the safest country in the world , if we have so many guns , and if you add to that , the fact that the incarceration rate here is so high so theoretically we’ve already taken off a large amount of criminals from the street . </s>
Can I answer that— Well , we’ll come to the third question , I just wan na bring in a third question , where , do we have a mic ? Okay . You have a bunch of hands around here . I’m just wondering with , regards to illegal gun ownership , how , no one has addressed exactly how to reduce that . </s>
You know , we’re talking about increasing the supply of guns . How about reducing the supply to criminals and people that shouldn’t have them . I’m going to not take the question because it’s a little bit off the point of our actual motion , with respect , but thank you , we’ll take one more ? Can you move to the lady… I—you can’t see , but a little bit forward ? </s>
She’s standing to you ? Thank you . </s>
To the whole panel , can you back off a bit , and say what exactly would constitute supporting or refuting the proposition that gun reduces crime . </s>
How would you , um , adjust for , um…other contributing circumstances , how do you evaluate what is anecdotal evidence and what is significant evidence , how can you determine that you’re comparing , not comparing apples and oranges . Surely , calling the NRA execrable doesn’t constitute evidence one way or another so— </s>
Okay , we take your point on the question and thank you for it . Is an AK-47 something that people should have a right to carry around , in the—on the same terms as a handgun . Stephen Halbrook , who represents the NRA— </s>
The Second Amendment protects the right to keep and bear arms and the question is what kinds of arms are Constitutionally protected and the Supreme Court just addressed that in the Heller case and said that , handguns are commonly possessed by law-abiding citizens historically for lawful purposes . Rifles and shotguns , now , the term AK-47 is very ambiguous , if it means a real AK-47 that means a fully automatic machine gun . </s>
They’re very highly restricted in this country , they have to be registered with the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives . </s>
They’re not possessed by that many people , they’re not used in crimes by the way , registered AK-47’s , there’s not very many of them around . But that’s really never where the debate has been , the debate has always been , for example the Brady Center supporting the D.C. handgun ban . What people are concerned about is the ability to have a normal kind of gun in their house to protect themselves and to have rifles , pistols and shotguns for sporting purposes or other lawful purposes . The debate has never been about AK-47 , there’s been… there are certain kinds of rifles that might look like an AK-47 and they’re called by the press assault weapons but they’re not assault weapons and they’re not AK-47’s , they just have certain cosmetic features that are similar , so— But from a public relations point of view I think the question makes some sense if it’s put in terms of do you—are there certain categories that should be restricted more from the public than handguns are . </s>
Real AK-47’s , I don’t know of anybody who advocates deregulating them under current , the federal law which is very strict— Steve , didn’t you file— Paul Helmke— —something with the Supreme Court arguing that the machine gun ban was unconstitutional ? I mean you’ve argued that machine guns should be allowed , right— </s>
The— You know , this whole thing is really a red herring— Wait , let Stephen answer that , that was a question to Stephen . Right , the National Firearms Act passed in 1934 provides that , certain kinds of highly restricted firearms can be registered and possessed by law-abiding citizens who go through these extreme background checks and… If you were to pass a ban on any kind of gun it does raise questions under the Second Amendment as well as the Interstate Commerce Clause , and there was a Supreme Court where we raised that issue . </s>
We did not argue that machine guns were protected by the Second Amendment , we argued that , a constitutional issue was raised by whether they should be banned or not and it’s something that— It had to do with a statutory interpretation , it’s not a case that was a Second Amendment case—the only Second Amendment case the Supreme Court has dealt with is the Heller case , and it’s decided that the kind of guns that we’re all ordinarily talking about here , rifles , pistols and handguns are the ones that are , I’m sorry , rifles , shotguns and handguns are the ones that are constitutionally protected— these other issues are red herrings . Gary Kleck , your fellow team member— </s>
I think it’s kind of ironic here that we hear an echo of the NRA’s old slippery slope argument , you know , that if they have even moderate control it’ll eventually lead to prohibition , this is kind of the flip-side of that . That if we in any way allow non-criminal citizens to have guns for self-protection that it’s bound to lead somehow down a slippery slope to everybody having machine guns and opening up in church on Sunday— Now , come on—we are not arguing that— </s>
And , also— —we are not supporting— —you know , you kinda—why do these guys on the other side— </s>
We— —always come up with weirdo anecdotes— We don’t argue for gun bans— —about the one in a million— —I’ve got no— </s>
—case where— Okay— —where things go badly— —simultaneous conversation actually is not working— </s>
I’ve got no problems with folks , I’ve got no problems with folks owning guns for hunting , for collecting , for self-defense , I want them to make sure they understand the responsibilities that go with that gun , I want them to know that the Heller case says that there are restrictions that you’re allowed to have on guns and that governments can do those restrictions . And I think if you get that commonsense approach and realize we got gun bans off the table , and we’ve got the whole idea of anybody , any gun , anywhere , anytime is off the table too , let’s figure out what can work to make our communities safer in the middle . That means I think some restrictions on these large-capacity clips , restrictions on machine guns , doing the background checks , limiting the number of guns you can buy at one time— Paul— </s>
—doing things to deal with illegal trafficking— Your organization supported bans— </s>
Those things make sense and it’s not a— I want to wrap this up because our third questioner asked the question for the third time tonight , if the United States has so many handguns why is it not the safest nation in the world , and John Lott , I think the question— Or Gary Kleck , you can answer it . And my response is , you know , if we have 600,000 police officers , more than any other democracy in the world , why didn’t we eliminate crime . You know , if we lock up two million people in prison , why didn’t it eliminate crime . </s>
The simple answer is no one solution is going to solve crime and no one proposed that it did , that’s a non-argument . Nothing is a perfect solution or a complete solution and you hear no one on this panel make that argument . It’s just a matter of given that we don’t have a complete solution to the problem , what do we do in the meanwhile , what do we do right now , what do individuals do , and why would you want to prevent them from doing something that makes them safer . And John Lott , you’re gon na have the final word in this section , go ahead— Okay , thank you . </s>
Even across countries , there are countries in the world that have more gun ownership than occurs in the United States , you have Switzerland , for example , you have— which has one of the lowest— self-defense— —traditionally one of the lowest murder rates in Europe . You have Israel , which probably has the highest gun possession rate in the world and yet , traditionally has one of the lowest murder rates in the world . There are lots of things that affect crime rates across places . </s>
If you look in the United States , 50 percent of the counties in the United States have zero murders in any given year . 25 percent of the counties have one murder . </s>
Over 70 percent of the murders in the United States are concentrated in just over 3 percent of the counties , those counties represent over 20 percent of the population but they get over 70 percent of the murders . And yet if you look across it , it’s the counties without any murders that have by far the highest gun ownership rates , it’s the , it’s the few percent that have 70 percent where you have by far the lowest gun ownership rates . So , I mean there are lots of things that are going on there , there are drug gangs that I think populate these high-crime urban areas that’s a real problem . And one can go and talk about the problems there , that’ll be a different subject to go into . And— </s>
All right , John , I’m going to stop you there because of a time issue . </s>
I want to point out where we at this point , we’ve wrapped up the , the head-to-head section , and we are at the point , approaching the point where we need all of you to make the decision that decides , how this evening ends . Let’s— to remind you when you came in and we polled you on the motion , “Guns reduce crime , ” 13 percent of you agreed , 60 percent of you disagreed . And 27 percent were undecided , we have heard the bulk of the arguments and the back-and-forth . But now we’re going to allow each panelist to sum up his position with a two- minute statement , beginning with the Seattle Chief of Police , Gil Kerlikowske . </s>
Chief ? Sure , I want to restate in the second sentence when I did my seven minutes , I said there is no debate about people’s right to own and possess guns . It is what the Supreme Court has defined as the reasonableness issue . John Lott told you that , well , people with concealed firearms rarely commit murders . Guess what , people that go through some type of check and go through a police department to get their concealed firearms permit , don’t go out and commit a lot of crimes . </s>
But , he also used the same argument that , well , let me tell you that people wouldn’t make the newspaper if you threaten somebody with a gun who was trying to rob you and it went off and it wouldn’t even be reported . I can tell you that people with concealed firearms permits drive drunk—with a gun in their holster in their car . </s>
People with concealed firearms permits in which we sent a clerk home because she issued one on a Monday , and on Friday when she was filing saw that the person had , after getting the permit committed suicide with a gun within the same week . And one of our young women officers who talked a drunken women out of a gun who was holding it to her head and her face and in her lap , and finally was able to wrestle it away , had just gotten her concealed firearms permits . None of those cases made the newspapers , so there are plenty of cases out there , as an example . I think reasonableness should enter into this , it should be more than just being upright and not being blind to allow you to carry a gun . </s>
Thank you , Chief Kerlikowske , Seattle Chief of Police speaking against the motion . Speaking for the motion in his summarizing statement , John Lott , senior research scholar at the University of Maryland . Thank you all again very much for inviting us here , it’s a great pleasure to be here . You know , there are a lots of things that affect crime . </s>
I think—as I said before I think police are the single most important factor . But we can deal with numbers on a lot of these things , we have anecdotal stories , the police chief just went through some . </s>
I advise you , you can go and check these things out . The Florida department of—of issuing these concealed handgun permits has detailed records , you can go to their website . The Texas Department of Public Safety , if you just Google Texas Department of Public Safety , concealed handguns , they’ll go through year by year , and tell you how many permit- holders have been convicted for driving under the influence of alcohol . And you’ll—it’s an incredibly tiny number , that this happens . I’m not saying it’s zero . </s>
But the rate at which people lose their permits for any type of firearms-related violation , he gave examples of that , you look , state after state , it’s hundreds or thousands of one percentage point . Off-duty police officers in Florida , were arrested and convicted at higher rates by about four times greater than concealed-carry permit holders were arrested in Florida during the same period of time . And I want to respond to John Donohue’s comments about D.C. It’s not true whether you look at rates or you look at numbers that you’re going to see the murder rates fall or robbery rates fall after D.C.’s handgun ban . </s>
It goes up in either case . It just goes up more with the rate , and with—when he says it falls what happens is , when you’re just looking at the numbers , the numbers are falling quickly before the ban , and rising relatively slowly after , and what he does is compare the before average , and the after average , and that makes it look like the before average is higher than the after average , so it looks like , well , it’s fallen , but it’s just the average , if you look at year by year , you use it’s falling slowly and then rising faster afterwards . There’s no way you can break down these numbers , and not see that D.C. , Chicago , England , Jamaica , Ireland , other countries which have banned guns have not seen increases in violent crime rates afterwards . </s>
And D.C. just didn’t rise relative to what it was before , it went from being 15th to one or two in the country . Thank you , John Lott . </s>
Summarizing his position against the motion , John Donohue , economist and professor of law at Yale . Again , the D.C. case is a case of a city that was massively depopulating with its most affluent citizens leaving at the time . Steve Levitt , the author of Freakanomics , is a John Bates Clark Award winner , sometimes described as the junior Nobel Prize in economics . He dismissed John Lott’s more guns , less crime theory in his books and writing , when other scholars tried to look at this work they found that right-to-carry laws simply don’t bring down the rate of crime . </s>
We have heard the discussion in the United States . There are many features of the United States that would suggest we’d have one of the lowest rates of violent crime , rich countries in general have low rates of violent crime , we’re the richest . We have more people in prison than any other country in , in world history . In fact no European country has even half the level of incarceration rate that we have . </s>
Yet , our crime rate is phenomenally high and you hear , the proposition is that more guns would reduce crime , we have 42 percent of the world’s guns in civilian hands in the United States , how many more would we need to get down to the level of crime of our European allies , they mentioned Switzerland and Israel , again these are completely inapposite . Switzerland has a regime in which individuals are in a militia , they take home an assault weapon , and they are given a locked container of ammunition that they’re not allowed to open up , they have to repeatedly come to headquarters and show that they haven’t opened it up and if they have they’re put in jail . In Israel , they do put you in jail if you lose your gun . This is the problem . They keep ignoring the fact that millions , or between 500,000 and a million of guns are stolen every year , that means a gun in a criminal’s hands , even if it’s keeping you epsilon safer by having a gun , when your gun gets turned over to a criminal , that’s making everybody else more unsafe . </s>
So it doesn’t matter what happens to the right-to-carry holder , and what he did , it matters what happens to the gun that he got , that then got used by a criminal to kill someone else . Thank you , John Donahue . Summing up his position for the motion , “Guns reduce crime , ” Stephen Halbrook , attorney representing the NRA in several lawsuits . </s>
Thank you , John , I want to respond to two things that Professor Donohue has stated in the Heller case the Supreme Court decided that the Second Amendment guarantees the individual right of , of individual citizens to keep and bear arms including handguns . That’s the position that the NRA has taken , for many , many decades through— of its history since 1871 . And Mr. Donohue said that the NRA does not tell the truth on the Second Amendment . Well , then the Supreme Court doesn’t either because that’s what the Supreme Court held in the Heller case . </s>
If you walk out back and you go to the bookstand here at this auditorium you’ll see a book called The Founders’ Second Amendment , which I authored -- it’s a new book on the history of the Second Amendment and you’ll see , basically agreement with what the Supreme Court held , that it is an individual right , that the NRA did not make it up . In addition , I’ve been to Switzerland many times and participated in shooting matches with military rifles . And you can buy all the ammunition you want at the shooting ranges and at gun shops . You’re issued a tin of ammunition that you’re not allowed to open because they want it to be available if the militia army has to be mobilized , but there’s no restriction on your ammunition usage or purchases , so it’s— every Swiss male when he enters age 20 is issued a military assault rifle and he keeps it at home . </s>
And there’s an extremely low crime rate in Switzerland . A remaining thought I would like to say in favor of the proposition , is , I would like everybody to kind of think about yourself . You’ve heard here tonight , that we’re all potential murderers , that if we get angry if we have a gun we’re gon na kill somebody . </s>
It’s just not true , most people with these concealed-weapon permits , are just like you and me , they’re normal people , they don’t just suddenly get angry or , or have a couple glasses of wine and , and go on murderous sprees . We’re not like that , most Americans are good people—they can be trusted with guns , and they should be trained . Children should be trained in gun safety but to somehow act like …we’re all potential criminals is just , completely beyond the pale . Thank you , Stephen Halbrook . Summing up his position against the motion , “Guns reduce crime , ” Paul Helmke , president of the Brady Campaign and Brady Center to Reduce Gun Violence . </s>
Again I want to thank all of our listeners tonight , the question you have to ask yourself is , did the other side prove its case , did they prove that guns reduce crime . </s>
You haven’t really heard any evidence that shows that it did . And I think the question you should ask yourself to just get a gut-check on this is , when you’re at the next sporting event , or when you’re sitting in the restaurant , would you feel safer thinking that everyone had a gun , or that no one had a gun . The reason that you react that way , is because you know instinctively that we make it too easy for dangerous people and people that don’t know the responsibilities that go with guns to get guns . I ask the question , why aren’t we the safest country in the world if we’ve got so many guns . It’s because we make it too easy , we don’t know where those guns are , we don’t know who has the guns . </s>
And if you have a gun , and again I’m not anti-gun and if you want a gun and understand the responsibilities , fine . </s>
But there are responsibilities that go with it , the Supreme Court made it clear there are restrictions that go with it . Where do the guns come from that the bad guys , that the gang members get . </s>
They steal them from people like you . They steal them from gun stores who lose their—quote , “lose” 30,000 guns every year . </s>
They get them through straw purchase . </s>
There are no limits on the number of guns you can buy at one time , there are very few limits on the type of guns you can buy . In most places in this country there really are no laws…very few laws , restricting who gets guns . We make it too easy for dangerous people to get guns . </s>
The way to reduce crime is to do things like background checks . Fight the illegal trafficking in guns . </s>
Say that some guns should not be in the hands of the civilian population . </s>
Those are things that can help take down the crime rates in our communities , not flooding our communities with more guns . Thank you very much . Thank you , Paul Helmke . And our final speaker , as we approach the moment of truth…speaking for the motion , “Guns reduce crime , ” Gary Kleck , professor of criminology and criminal justice at Florida State . You may remember I started out my opening remarks by saying you sometimes need to listen for the silences , and I think the panelists on the other side demonstrated that because they didn’t in fact address the evidence that we presented…Paul Helmke insists we didn’t present any evidence , we cited some of the most thoroughly vetted scientific evidence we have on the question . </s>
Study after study repeatedly showed the same thing , it showed defensive gun use as common , it showed defensive gun use as effective . It shows that after we pass these shall-issue carry laws and make it easy to , to get a carry permit , crime does not go up… It’s also a sign of a weakness , of a particular position when people have to misstate what the issue is , remember the proposition was that guns reduce crime , okay , do they make you safer to have a gun…well , we didn’t really hear anything about that . Instead we hear Paul Helmke saying would you feel comfortable with everybody having a gun , well of course that’s not the issue , nobody here proposed that because of course “everybody” includes lunatics , convicted murderers , robbers , rapists and so on . It’s not the proposition , and in fact no one here even secretly thinks that we ought to do that , it’s not an issue , so why not confront the issue , do guns reduce crime . Well , in fact guns in the hands of non-criminals , guns in the hands of crime victims , do make them safer . </s>
So what does this imply for policy , well , the implication for policy is , let’s do what we can to keep guns away from criminals , but that should not include taking them away from non-criminals who would use them to save their lives , to prevent the completion of rapes and robberies , to prevent injuries , and to prevent the loss of property , we should instead do what common-sensically most of America has been doing for decades which is moderate controls aimed at preventing criminals from getting guns but without denying them to non-criminals . That was Gary Kleck , thank you . And now we are at the moment of truth , you can turn once again to the keypads by your seats and we want you to vote on our motion , “Guns reduce crime.” Press “1” if you support the motion , press number “2” if you are against , press number “3” if you are undecided , it will take us about 90 seconds to tabulate the results , in the meantime I want to point out what’s coming up next . </s>
On Tuesday , November 18th , the motion of our debate will be , “Google Violates Its ‘Don’t Be Evil’ Motto.” Panelists for the motion include Harry Lewis , a professor of computer science at Harvard , Randall Picker , a professor of commercial law at the University of Chicago Law School , and Siva Vaidhyanathan who is professor of media studies and law at the University of Virginia . </s>
Against the motion , we have John Batelle who is founder , chairman and CEO of Federated Media Publishing , Esther Dyson , an investor in information technology companies , and Jeff Jarvis , director of the interactive journalism program at the City University of New York . These debates as we’ve made clear several times can be heard on more than 150 NPR stations across the country . So just check your local NPR station for the date and times of the broadcast . </s>
The results are coming down…as I point out the copies of books and DVD’s , books by all of these people are on sale in the lobby… And they are very willing to sell and sign . And finally a reminder that our debate on December 2nd , “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last 50 Years”… which was not meant to be an applause line— will be recorded for broadcast on BBC World News Television and to accommodate that taping for that broadcast , we will be moving the debate to the Symphony Space . That’s at 95th and Broadway , and for more information , please visit our website , and now , the results… Hmm . Before the debate , 13 percent were for the motion , 60 percent were against , and 27 percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , there was movement on all fronts but it looks as though the motion— the side for the motion moved more of you . 27 percent agree with the motion that guns reduce crime , 64 percent of you disagree , and now only 10 percent of you are undecided . So , it was a close , a close call , with a little bit of an edge to those for the motion in terms of moving and changing minds . Congratulations to all of our panelists . </s>
null Well thank you very , very much Judy and good evening to all of you . I 'm here with Dana Wolfe , the executive producer of this debate series and we 'd like to welcome each of you to this third debate of our fall season . We want to encourage each of , each side of tonight 's argument to listen to the proposing views and respond to inconvenient facts . I hope you the audience come away with the recognition that there 's an intellectually respectable argument on both sides . </s>
And I want to thank once again WNYC and NPR for producing and airing these debates on public radio and to The Times of London for their sponsorship . </s>
I want to especially thank our moderator this evening , veteran broadcast journalist Judy Woodruff . And the extraordinary group of panelists who are the true stars of tonight 's evening . This evening 's debate is extraordinarily timely . Just this week , Prime Minister Ohmert took a conciliatory stance , offering Palestinians a series of incentives to build on a shaky cease fire in Gaza . It was also reported that Hamas lost control at a key Palestinian university , perhaps reflecting the shift in thinking of educated youth , cognizant of the economic costs of its continued violent rhetoric . </s>
In presenting tonight 's debate , we 're hopeful that the rapidly shifting events of the day can be seen in a broader context and a more historical and strategic one . In particular the debate promises to highlight the interplay of two ideas that both have deep appeal . The first is that the more democracy we have in the world , the better and safer the world will be . Our commitment to this idea cuts across a partisan divide . Ever since Woodrow Wilson , there 's been a strong current in American foreign policy to promote a world order based on moral principles that we believe in . </s>
A current which liberal human rights activists and conservative democracy advocates both embody . The second idea is that the more terrorism succeeds as a weapon to achieve geopolitical objectives , the more dangerous our world becomes . Success emboldens terrorist groups , enhances their status as they jockey for power . </s>
Well the tension between these ideas comes into sharp focus if a terrorist group prevails in a democratic election . </s>
In principle , how should we interact with such a government ? And what about Hamas in particular ? Once in power , are Hamas leaders forced by global and local realities into a pragmatic stance ? Should we listen to their rhetoric differently – as the familiar efforts of politicians to shore up their base , by speaking to the most extreme of their supporters . </s>
Which way does the evidence point ? These kinds of questions , more than the semantics of the proposition itself , should determine how we vote on tonight 's motion . I 'm now gon na hand the evening over to our moderator , Judy Woodruff , who has covered politics and other news for more than three decades , at CNN , NBC and PBS . This year she has been conducting a series of reports for PBS on the views of young Americans . Thank you Judy . </s>
Enjoy the debate . </s>
Thank you Bob very much for that introduction . And I am delighted to be here . </s>
I want to welcome all of you in the audience here in New York City , to the third Intelligence Squared US debate . I agree with what Bob Rosenkranz just said . We need more civilized discussions of important , even critical topics like the one we 're gon na be hearing about tonight . I 'm gon na give you just a brief rundown of this evening . First , we are gon na have the proposer of the motion begin by presenting his side of the argument . </s>
The opposition will follow . Each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we will go back and forth from one side to the other . </s>
Second , when all six speakers have finished with their opening remarks I 'm gon na be opening up the floor for brief questions from you in the audience . </s>
Third , when the question period from the audience is complete , each of the debaters will make a final statement that will last not more than two minutes each . </s>
And fourth , during those closing statements , ballot boxes are gon na be passed around the auditorium for voting . These are the tickets that you have , you should have in your hands . You will put in either the for piece , it 's green or the against piece , it 's red . </s>
You 'll tear it off . Tear it off , rip it off and put it in , whichever side you are for . Or the whole ticket if you still do n't know which side you favor . If anyone does not have a ticket ballot an usher will get you one at an appropriate moment . </s>
Fifth and last , after the final closing statements have been made , I will announce the results of the audience vote and we will know then which side has carried the day . We are fortunate tonight to have a very distinguished panel to be our debaters and I 'm going to introduce them now . </s>
For the motion , former foreign policy advisor to Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and until earlier this month , Israel 's ambassador to the United States , Daniel Ayalon . </s>
An expert on Arab politics and US Middle East policy from the Council on Foreign Relations , Steven A. Cook . Author , senior fellow at the Hudson Institute and editor-at-large of National Review , John O'Sullivan . </s>
And now against the motion . Lawyer and advocate for Muslim and Palestinian advocates , Stanley L. Cohen . Associate Director of the Harvard program on humanitarian policy and conflict research , Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou . And journalist , author and co-director of the UK/DC based conflicts forum , Mark Perry . </s>
And now we will begin the debate and to present the question once again , a democratically elected Hamas is still a terrorist organization . We are gon na call on each person to step up to the podium . I 'm gon na call on them . </s>
And we are gon na begin with Steven A. Cook . For . Thank you very much for being here this evening . I 'd like to thank first of all IQ2 and the Rosenkranz Foundation . </s>
And looking out at the audience today it 's truly extraordinary what a diverse group we have . Uh people in the audience who would n't normally sit together to discuss such difficult and emotion – and often emotional issues . Um I 'd also like to thank Judy Woodruff for uh being here to uh to moderate this debate . </s>
And I 'd also like to thank my fellow debaters . Uh I am very much looking forward to this evening 's intellectual combat . The subject of this evening 's debate is in one sense rather puzzling . </s>
Despite electoral success , Hamas is still a terrorist organization . What is there really to debate here ? What does participation in an election have to do with Hamas ' profile as a terrorist organization ? I am quite sure that my colleagues on the other side of the debate will tell you that the Palestinian elections were the truest , freest and fairest in the Arab world . </s>
That 's an absolutely true statement . They 're also going to tell you that the outcome reflected the will of the Palestinian people . That 's an absolutely false statement . And three , they 're gon na tell you that Hamas provides critical social services to Palestinians in need . </s>
That is , my friends , totally irrelevant to tonight 's subject . These arguments amount to little more than an analytical slight of hand . An organization can participate in a free and fair election . It can provide social services and be a terrorist organization . </s>
There is no seriously scholarly work out there that indicates that any of these activities are mutually exclusive . Despite what Bob Rosenkranz said in his eloquent remarks to open this evening 's events , it is not an intellectual position to suggest that Hamas is no longer a terrorist organization . </s>
It 's an ideological position . It 's ideological . Rather than an analytical conclusion based on the available evidence , let 's consider a few things . </s>
I 'll leave it to my colleagues to describe for you the number of innocents who have been killed at the hands of Hamas . But it 's important to provide some historical context here . To the evolution of Hamas . Hamas ' very founding in the late 1980 's was based on an imperative of violence . In the late 1980 's , members of the Palestine branch of the Muslim Brotherhood grew concerned that another organization called Islamic Jihad was taking prestige and influence away from them because Islamic Jihad was engaged in violence . </s>
Their solution to this political problem was the establishment of Hamas . They would continue the Islamization of Palestinian society from below through the provision of social services , in keeping with the historic mission of the Muslim Brotherhood . But they also established a military wing . </s>
A military wing that was dedicated to terrorist acts against Israelis in an effort to burnish their nationalist image and out-maneuver Islamic Jihad . The founding covenant of Hamas which has not changed is explicit in its mission to elaborate all of historical Palestine through a variety of tactics including violence . The result has been the bloody carnage of the streets of Tel Aviv , Jerusalem , Ashkelon and numerous other Israeli cities . </s>
My critics will say this is old news . Hamas has evolved . It 's become a political organization . This as Mahmoud Mohamedou said is a historic opportunity . </s>
But my question is has Hamas really evolved ? </s>
It still denies Israel 's right to exist . None of its leaders have renounced the right to armed struggle . The only thing has changed is a tactical change . It has sought to harness the elections that the United States has pushed on the Palestinians to advance its agenda . And what is that agenda ? </s>
The establishment of a Palestinian state in all of historic Palestine with sharia Islamic law at its core . Well what about a cease fire ? My critics will tell you there 's been a cease fire since 2003 . Be careful about the words that people use when talking about a cease fire . </s>
Hamas calls it a hudna . My colleague Mahmoud Mohamedou calls it tahdiya . Well in fact both of those , both of those have a temporary quality to them . </s>
Anyone who speaks Arabic should know that a hudna has a finite period of time . It 's not much of a cease fire anyway . </s>
Since the Israelis withdrew from the Gaza Strip they 've been victim of rocket assaults on their towns , the kidnapping of their soldiers and threats to their major cities . Under the weight of available evidence and I have a little bit of uh a little bit of this just before . Stanley and I were standing around before , talking about what we did agree on . The Giants , the Yankees , the Knicks and the desultory state of our teams . And then we got into talking about Hamas and I said sure , they would n't be a terrorist organization , they just have to lay down their arms . </s>
And he said you 're right the Israelis have to lay down their arms . That 's not the point . </s>
It 's cute , it 's funny but it 's not the point . Under the weight of available evidence , supporters of Hamas tend to shift their argument to focus on Israeli behavior . </s>
And I should point out a case in point was Judy Woodruff 's extraordinary interview with former President Carter last night on the “NewsHour.” It is true , Israel has expropriated land and continues to illegally settle the West Bank . Israel has killed Palestinian civilians . </s>
Though unlike Hamas not intentionally . It has worked assiduously to undermine Mahmoud Abbas and before him Yasser Arafat . All this is very , very true . </s>
But it neither alters the fact that Hamas is a terrorist organization . Nor absolves Hamas of the bloody responsibility for its own behavior . If the issue was Israel 's contributed to an environment where extremist ideologies , alienation and terrorism can thrive , there would be little to debate . But this is not the subject we 're examining here this evening . Participation in elections – Hamas ' participation in the Palestinian elections is analytically irrelevant of whether it is a terrorist organization or not . </s>
It is a group that remains dedicated to Israel 's destruction and in the process of that destruction , the inevitable killing of innocents . For Hamas to no longer be considered a terrorist organization it must change its charter . It must renounce its violence and it must lay down its arms . At that point and only at that point can it be seen as a legitimate participant in the political arena . </s>
With that I urge you , I urge you to vote with the proposition that a democratically elected Hamas is and remains a terrorist organization . Thank you very much . Against the proposition , Stanley L. Cohen . I would like to thank everyone for the invitation for tonight . To repeat this is a wonderful event . </s>
It 's much needed in this city . I find myself sort of changing what I wanted to say as I was sitting here and listening to my adversary . I come from a different perspective . </s>
Interestingly enough , I’ve just returned from Damascus where I happened to be meeting with the leadership of Hamas . And I and I bring that to your attention because when I said I was coming to a debate in New York City over whether you 're a terrorist organization or not , the leadership said you Westerners you spend all your time debating how many angels are on the head of a pin and history marches on . And that 's not to denigrate or the significance of this debate , this discussion tonight . But to keep in its perspective that while we debate , while we argue , while we disagree , there is death and destruction on the ground . </s>
And while my adversary trivializes the injury to Palestinians , I 'd like to sort of begin by really honing in on what we 're talking about tonight . Since the year 2000 , 4,800 Palestinians , mostly civilians killed . 839 children under ten . 755 women . 31,750 injured . </s>
800 permanently disabled . 241 extra- judicial assassinations . 11,000 Palestinians including 380 under the age of sixteen and 240 women sitting in jails , most of whom who have never had a trial , have never seen a judge and do not have counsel . 4,800 homes demolished . 4,200 businesses destroyed . </s>
Thousands of hectares of oil groves razed . In the last five months , while unfortunately Israel has lost ten civilians , 557 Palestinians of whom 420 were civilians including 116 women and thirty three children were killed by the Israeli defense forces . </s>
Now collective punishment it 's not the exception . Attacks on the infrastructure , the disruption of water plants , the destruction of electricity . Unemployment . </s>
Infant mortality rates . Disease . </s>
Malnutrition . These are not issues for abstract debate . These are harsh realities for Palestinians . </s>
Who did this ? Hamas did n't do this , Israel did this . And it 's not new . </s>
Think back to the British . The Stern gang , Menachem Begin , a Prime Minister of Israel , a terrorist . The King David and hotels blown up . </s>
The UN mediator assassinated by the Stern gang . Ethnic cleansings with 800,000 Palestinians driven from their homers . 400 villages erased from the map . So this is not some sort of esoteric debate with the West . </s>
This is reality . This is truth and this is sixty years . An unbroken trail of terrorism , not at the hands of Hamas . But at the hands of Israel . </s>
Dar Yassin , Sabra and Shatila , I love the notion about how Israel always unlike Hamas , accidentally kills . Bethanune last week , nineteen women and children sitting in a house , an errant tank shell . Of course the apologies , of course Israel says oops well sorry . </s>
We 'll have an investigation and on it goes . And what of international law ? The Geneva conventions that prohibit systematic torture . The Israeli Supreme Court eventually put an end to it . </s>
The occupied lands in violation of Israeli law and Geneva conventions . </s>
It goes on and on . </s>
321 condemnations by the United – United Nations Generally – General Assembly ignored . Ninety one condemnations by the Security Council ignored . There is a double standard . And that 's what 's interesting and I mean no disrespect to the debate tonight . </s>
As a trial attorney sometimes I say to a witness so when did you stop beating your wife ? And the witness looks at you like what are you talking about ? And that 's the problem with the debate . It starts out with a pre-conceived notion that Hamas is a terrorist organization . </s>
To much of the world , Hamas is not viewed as a terrorist organization but rather a national liberation movement involved in low intensity , asymmetric warfare . To much of the world or many in the world community , Israel is viewed as a terrorist state . The problem is civilians are always caught in between . </s>
I do n't apologize for any civilian getting killed anywhere but I do n't make light of it as if they 're just fodder for the Israeli machine . We know in this country we 're used to civilian causalities . </s>
Sherman 's march on Atlanta . The fire bombings in Dresden . It goes on . </s>
If you 're a North American Indian you 're a little bit familiar with terrorism in this particular context . </s>
And Israel in the war this summer , a million cluster bombs and anti- personnel mines . There is a fine line between terrorism and freedom fighter unfortunately . And it is who wins . </s>
Every person in the world dies to have a picture taken with Nelson Mandela . Who stayed in jail an extra eight years because he refused to renounce armed struggle . Malcolm X , an American by any means necessary . Now he 's on postage stamps . </s>
So we have to be careful about evolving notions of terrorism . We have to be careful about language and what we suggest to the community . Who is Hamas ? </s>
Hamas is not just a military wing . It 's just kids strapping explosives on themselves . They 're doctors and lawyers and professors and scientists and academics who have given their life to try to get , to try to reclaim what has been stolen from them . Now you can trivialize the election but most important remember Hamas is millions of people who voted and many of them with a bigger plurality than George Bush ever appreciated in his two terms , voted for Hamas . Now there 's a double standard . </s>
The West , including Israel loves Abu Masen . And why do they love him ? </s>
Well because he speaks Western . He talks Western . He walks the walk . He looks good . He 's a good Palestinian leader . </s>
What 's interesting is he 's not considered a terrorist even though he 's a figure head of Fatah which has an armed movement called al-Aqsa . They do bombings but he 's OK . </s>
Hamas is not . Now what do we know that 's happened since the election ? Collective punishment . Leaders kidnapped . </s>
Cabinet members kidnapped . An attempt to destabilize and topple a legitimate elected government . Economic embargoes and strangulation . </s>
One – Providing arms to the other side . </s>
The bottom line here is Hamas is the only group that can deliver . Let us find a way to break out of this cycle . To break out of this abyss . </s>
To forget about labels . Labels mean nothing . The only group that can deliver is Hamas , and you know what – if they ca n't , they 'll be voted out . </s>
And at the end of the day it 's time to end the embargo , it 's time to empty the jails , it 's time to stop the attempt to topple a government . But most of all forget the labels and forget the rhetoric . For sixty years it has not worked . </s>
Give the alternative a chance . Thank you . Thank you and now for the proposition , John O'Sullivan . JOHN O'SULLIVAN Madam Chairperson , ladies and gentlemen . </s>
Uh well thank you for that kind introduction before Ms. Woodruff . And um and I want to share in the general uh agreement of the panel here that we 're grateful for the organizers of this event of which there ought to be many more . Uh in order to stimulate genuinely interesting debate . I um I will begin by going straight to the topic . </s>
Because anyone who deals with terrorism has to be begin , and I was asked to do this by the last speaker , with its definition . I think you must also scotch the old canard that one man 's terrorist is another man 's freedom fighter . My own definition has the distinction of having been adopted by the Court of Appeals in Canada . If I may quote , Mister Justice Neland , quoting me in the case of Canada versus Najoub in October , 2001 , the court spoke as follows – a terrorist is a man who murders indiscriminately , distinguishing neither between civilian and innocent and guilty nor soldier and civilian . </s>
He may employ terrorism – planting bombs in restaurants , hijacking planes , in a bad cause or a good one . He may be a Nazi terrorist or an anti-Nazi terrorist . A Communist or an anti-Communist . Pro Palestinian or pro-Israel . We may want to defeat his political cause or to see it triumph . </s>
For his methods however a terrorist is always to be condemned . Indeed to describe him objectively is to condemn him . Even if his cause is genuinely a fight for freedom with which we sympathize . Unquote , unquote . </s>
Now we are asked today to consider whether organizations that use terrorist methods as describe above should also be admitted into the arena of conventional politics and in particular to the arena of conventional democratic politics . The motion cites Hamas . But Hamas is not the only organization that combines seeking power through elections with terrorism . Hezbollah does the same . </s>
So does the Eta linked Batasuna party in the Basque region of Spain . So does the two headed Sinn Fein IRA in Northern Ireland . Nor are these organizations shy about their deeds . They openly boast of employing terrorism even if they sometimes quibble at the word . </s>
Sinn Fein for example has said clearly that it sought power through the Armalite rifle and the ballot box . These four parties I’ve mentioned have enjoyed varying degrees of success . They all raise the same question . </s>
If a democratically elected group employs terrorist methods , should it be regarded as having run itself out democratic politics and should we refuse , refuse to deal with it . Ideally I maintain that they should be run out of politics and that we should refuse to deal with them . Indeed I would go further . </s>
When we deal with such bodies , as if they are conventional parties , we are making murder respectable . We are in fact inciting people to murder . First because we are saying that murder is no bar to participation in high politics . And when we treat with terrorist parties supported by small numbers of voters as is true of the Basque party and it used to be true of Sinn Fein , we are inciting murder a second time . Because we have admitted , we are negotiating with them because they murder people and not for any other reason . </s>
When you incite murder you get more murders . </s>
Inciting terrorism has similarly produced a spreading stain of terrorism since the hijackings of Dawson Field in 1970 . </s>
Let me make a first qualification for this bold statement of principle . If the price of halting a murderous insurgency is to admit the former terrorists into democratic politics that may sometimes be a price worth paying to save lives and establish a decent political order . But it is a price . The terrorists moreover must be former . They must have abandoned terrorism finally , completely and publicly . </s>
They can not be mysteriously linked to terrorists still or leaving terrorism in a gradual way . </s>
They must be exclusively committed to democratic politics and willing to accept its verdicts even when those verdicts are unfavorable to them . I do n't like making that concession . It means that crimes go unpunished , injustice is entrenched and the moral of democracy is tainted . Note though that is a very limited concession . </s>
While we may have to deal with former terrorists in official transactions of normal business , we should show them no signs of approval or respect . Even if they hold high government positions , they must be given no state visits , no honorary knighthood , no White House dinners . Until they have purged their guilt in some way , they must always feel the mark of Cane is on their brow . But the distinguished advocates tonight , opposite , are proposing something far more dramatic than easing former thugs out of terrorism and into official limousines . They suggest that we should treat as good faith democrats those who are still engaged in organizing suicide bombings and still planning rocket attacks . </s>
Their election it seems somehow validates their terror methods or at least their terror methods do not invalidate their election . </s>
Now here 's my second qualification . </s>
We are going to reach somewhat different conclusions , depending on whether we are citizens of a country in which there is a terrorist group engaged in democratic politics . For example , if we 're a Lebanese democrat in a state which has Hezbollah as a political party . Or depending on whether we are citizens of a state that is the um that is the neighbor of a country which has a terrorist government . </s>
For example the citizen of Israel next door to a government that includes um Hamas . Uh take the first case . The citizen of the state in which there is a terrorist party . Uh engaged in normal politics . That means that one party in politics has got its own private army and the others do not . </s>
It can intimidate the other parties . It can overturn election results , it can ignore political defeats . Uh it is not in a sense a normal political party at all . And its very existence is a contradiction of the concept of democracy that most of us would recognize . </s>
What happens in such cases ? </s>
Well let us take the most favorable case for the other side , that of the Northern Ireland peace process which most people think has been a good thing . </s>
For the first eight years of this process One – JOHN O'SULLIVAN OK . I 'm afraid I 'm gon na skip to the , to the other point . Different principles apply when we 're talking about relations between states . If a state is at war with another , whether or not the enemy government is democratic is a very secondary consideration . </s>
What matters is the disposition of that state 's foreign policy . Does the other state have a serious interest in making peace ? If it makes peace will it keep its word ? </s>
Does it have long term aims compatible with a stable peace ? Are its internal dynamics such that the government offering to negotiate peace is likely to survive . On strictly practical grounds , it is hard to imagine a prudent citizen answering those questions positively if the other government is composed of terrorists or routed in a terrorist party . </s>
The terrorists have a serious interest in making peace – will they keep their word , are they trustworthy ? Do they generally have political aims compatible with a stable peace ? We should probably answer all those questions no . And if the terrorist government is democratically elected Time 's up . </s>
JOHN O'SULLIVAN The prognosis might be worse rather than better . After all if an electorate has voluntarily elected a terrorist party , it 's internal dynamics are unlikely to be favorable to peace making and political stability . </s>
So for that reason it doesn’t really matter whether or not Hamas is democratically elected . What matters is whether or not it carries on its terrorist methods . And now against the proposition , Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou . </s>
Thank you very much Ms . Woodruff . You can add my voice to that of my colleagues to thank you and the organizers as well as the audience for this . </s>
Um it 's a wonderful opportunity to have indeed intelligent debate . Um let me also preface my remarks by saying that my comments tonight are mine alone and do n't necessarily reflect the views of my uh program . Let me pick up the argument where my friend Stan left it and it is that the inability to transcend the dominant misrepresentation of the Israeli occupation of Palestinian lands , is increasingly becoming problematic for both intelligent debate and informed policy making . It is a narrative that most people know to be problematic if not faulty . Yet is persists . </s>
Tonight 's motion fits that pattern . And I invite you to reject it on grounds of inaccuracy and lack of intelligence for that matter . Hamas is not a terrorist organization . Hamas was the radicalized military expression of a national liberation movement , which grew into a social movement . Hamas is no longer a terrorist organization . </s>
Hamas has moved to a political contest which it has joined legitimately and has won fairly . More importantly , Hamas holds high levels of legitimacy among the majority of the people that it has been elected to represent and lead . Now before developing these arguments um it is important to establish a set of facts , yet there is a familiar discourse , an emotional discourse about the plight of the Palestinians which I will not rehearse here tonight . </s>
It is a classical discourse which unfortunately has been , in recent years , rendered part of the background noise of world politics . Triggering almost a sort of Palestine fatigue . </s>
However , and in addition to the facts that Stanley has listed , it is the following facts that are crucial to the assessment of the situation and the proposed motion before us tonight . </s>
Thirty-nine years of occupation , 1.4 million people in Gaza alone , in three hundred and sixty square kilometers . </s>
Five hundred and forty checkpoints in the West Bank alone , with a forty percent increase in that number in the past year . Settlements and buildings and land confiscation , the building of a separation wall , not a fence , a wall deemed illegal by the International Court of Justice . Daily , near daily military incursions and sporadic killing , essentially almost half a century of Palestinian disposition , loss of life and freedom . Now in that most urgent of context , a group that emerges as a resistance movement , grows into a social network upgrading welfare centers and educational services , and agrees to abide by the rules of Democratic contest , can certainly no longer be called terrorist . </s>
Now Canadian definitions not withstanding , it is important , this is no mere matter of semantics to remember that the word “terrorist” is actually quite problematic when it comes to occupied people . </s>
Yes , indeed the saying “Your terrorist is my freedom fighter” captures that inherent subjectivity quite well . And some names were mentioned . To those we can add just this past century , Michael Collins and the IRA , and I will not even mention the Haganah , the Irgun , Yitzhak Shamir and others . Nelson Mandela and the ANC and so on , all of these people have been called by their opponents terrorists . </s>
The French resistance fighting the Germans , the FLN fighting the French . Yet time and again , both these individuals and their movements led their groups to national leadership and oftentimes through elections . But the operative word of the motion is “still , ” so is Hamas still a terrorist organization ? Well let us look at what Hamas has done in the past ten months since their election . </s>
Even before that election , Hamas had decided on and implemented the unilateral cease fire . </s>
Which it observed for fifteen months straight until the Israeli killing this past June of the seven members of Ghalia family . Hamas had made former statements at the highest level of its multi-faceted representation regarding a disposition to enter this long-term truce . Much is made of this concept of hudna . It is important to understand that in fact , the phraseology used and the legal term is actually quite important in relation to an Islamic movement , which per force , obligates them too , and indeed is a form of protorecognition to begin with . Hamas has been part of discussions throughout the summer and the fall on a draft document for a program that we quote , “respect previous agreements in a manner that protects and safeguards the high interest and the rights of the Palestinian people.” </s>
Hamas had also proposed a coalition government back in March which included Palestinian Christians and women and has folded its executive force into the former national police . What have Israel , the EU , and the United States done in the same time frame ? Insisting on this Three-Fold demand that Hamas recognizes Israel , forswears violence , and accepts previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements . </s>
They have decreed and implemented a crippling international embargo with a new humanitarian crisis by UN reckoning , a security crisis by security specialists’ reckoning , and indeed some sort of Iraq-ization of Palestine with the birth in mid- October of Al Qaeda and Palestine , which sent its first , a novelty by Palestinian standards . But at this point one is really prompted to think , what kind of international community is this that is so blind to the injustice that it rationalizes ? And the one that perpetuates out of ill- conceived and inefficient policies , but the argument that I 'm putting before you is not an emotional one . </s>
It is not an ideological one , it is actually a rational one . The obvious problem with the Three-Fold demand is the disappearance of reciprocity . For the very same three demands could be put , but are not , to Israel . </s>
Israel has yet to recognize the existence of a Palestinian state on the 1967 borders . Israel has yet to stop its use of violence against occupied people , including women and children , and Israel has yet to implement the very agreements that it’s made with Palestinian representers . It is therefore contradictory to depict Hamas as still a terrorist organization while punishing Palestinians for their democratic choice . It should also be said that we’re in effect , asking Hamas to be held to agreements which we no longer trust . While everyone is saying that Oslo is dead and that we need new thinking and moving on , we’re asking this newcomer to be held to these agreements which have faded or are certainly fading . </s>
And in effect , holding them to our own liabilities and failures . </s>
Contradictions are also displayed through a reading of the fact . There is no internationally agreed definition of terrorism , which is already an evidence of that problem . However , by law what qualifies a group as a group , an entity as terrorists is the indiscriminate targeting of civilians . </s>
So for the law to have any consistence , currency , it has to be applied across the board with certain selectivity . Which leads me to my last element . Hamas is an adolescent Hezbollah , and look at what Hezbollah has become next door . The strongest power in Lebanon and the first one to ever defeat Israel . </s>
So there’s a sort of the assumption that Hamas can be extricated from that political reality is unrealistic . Ladies and gentlemen , given half a chance , Prime Minister Ismail Haniya and his Hamas colleagues are Gerry Adamses in the making . Voting for this motion essentially means endorsing and supporting a unilateral , sterile understanding of this conflict . I invite you to exercise intelligence , display fairness , and vote against the motion . Thank you for your attention . </s>
And against the proposition , I 'm sorry for the proposition , I misspoke . For the proposition , Daniel Ayalon . Thank you very much . </s>
Can you hear me ? </s>
Now start the clock now . Good evening , thank you very much for being here . With all due respect to my colleagues and my team , Steven Cook and John O’Sullivan who did a fantastic job , I must even thank more our adversaries , Stanley Cohen and Mahmoud , which did a great job actually convincing you I 'm sure , to actually vote for the motion that Hamas is a terror organization . Actually I will depart . </s>
Naively I thought that uh , they will relate to the nature of Hamas . What do they do ? What do they believe in ? What is their conduct ? </s>
But no , they actually opened the debate to a more geopolitical and historic um , issues which actually leave me on a much firmer ground . So I will depart from the notes I prepared here and I will answer the , my esteemed colleagues here on the other side who talked about occupation , who talked about Israeli aggression , who talked about UN resolutions , and I will say something which is very , very simple . Israel was attacked in 1967 by three countries around us , Jordan , Egypt , and Syria . </s>
The “Occupation , ” quote-unquote as they call it , is this territory which was obtained by Israel as an act of self-defense . </s>
These three countries and others were trying to push us into the sea and actually destroy Israel , destroy the Jewish people who came back to their historic land , to their Biblical land , to the place where they belong . </s>
Now , the war happened in 1967 . Israel was created in 19- , or was recreated in 1948 . From 1948 to 1967 , nineteen years , there was no occupation . </s>
West Bank belonged to Jordan , Gaza belonged to uh , Egypt , nobody talked about occupation then . Nobody talked about creating a Palestinian You know why ? Because they wanted to create this Palestinian state right where Israel is now today , killing all the Jews . So from 1967 on , against her will , we had to defend ourselves and obtain possession of these territories . But still , we always wanted peace . </s>
The proof , 1977 . When we had a leader like Anwar Sadat of Egypt , and he signed a peace treaty with us and he renounced terror and violence and he recognized Israel , Israel withdrew entirely from the Sinai , having peace with Jordan now for more than thirty years , uh , with Egypt for more than thirty years . 1995 , Jordan , King Hussein , a great leader , wanted to make peace . </s>
We made peace . We withdrew from some , all the land that we occupied from Jordan and there is a peace between Israel and Jordan , recognizing each other , respecting each other , and not shooting at each other . In 1993 , Israel , believing that the Palestinians really had a change of heart and they would like to make peace with us , we signed as the Oslo Accord . And the Oslo Accord was a very simple view , land for peace . Israel withdrawing from West Bank in Gaza , the Palestinians got a hold of themselves , stopped the terror , and becoming a responsible party . </s>
2000 , Camp David , former Prime Minister Barak meeting with uh , with Arafat to try and make peace . Barak is offering to withdraw from the entire territories , but this was not accepted by Arafat . </s>
Not only was it not accepted , but after it was rejected , this intifada started . Intifada is a misnomer , it was a very planned , pre-planned campaign of terror which cost more than a thousand Israeli lives , many children , devastation in our cities , and uh , continued rejection of the very notion of the right of Israel to exist in its home land . Now people compare between Camp David ’78 that succeeded with Saddam Hussein , with , with us with Sadat . I 'm very tired , I came back from Israel not a few hours ago , between Sadat and Arafat , Camp David 2000 . What was the difference ? </s>
The difference was leadership . </s>
Sadat wanted to make peace . He prevailed over the advice of his advisors and signed a peace treaty . Arafat also unfortunately prevailed over the advice of his advisors who said sign the peace treaty because you will not get a better deal . And he was against it . </s>
Now Hamas was against Arafat . They did not even believe in any negotiations . They are against , and they were against Oslo , why ? Because they do not believe in Israel’s right to exist . They do not believe in coexistence , they do not believe in peace . </s>
They do not believe even , in a democracy . Because they would like to have one Islamist Palestinian country a la Iran , Iran style and under the Sharia , the , the , the law of , of Islam . So lets go back to the debate tonight . </s>
What is the definition of terror ? Killing intentionally of innocent people . </s>
What does Hamas do ? Killing only , only children and innocent people . They stand terrorists strapped in explosives into markets , into pizzerias , into coffee shops , and into school buses and kindergartens . This is what they do . </s>
Are they a terrorist organization ? </s>
If this is the definition of terror , they definitely are a terrorist organization . Secondly , do they believe in coexistence ? No , they deny Israel’s right to exist . Now people here are talking about whether elected democratically or not , this is besides the point . Just look into the Hamas , www.hamas.com in their website on the internet and look into the Hamas charter . </s>
They believe in killing , they don’t believe in Israel , they don’t believe in any peace . So are they a terror organization ? According to this definition , they are as well . </s>
Now there is another issue here . Who is Hamas operated by ? Are they really doing the will of the people ? I do n't think so . My esteemed colleague here on the other side , Stanley Cohen said he just returned from Damascus and he met Khaled Meshaal ? </s>
Where did he meet Khaled Meshaal ? In Damascus . Who is really operating Khaled Meshaal ? </s>
The Syrians , and the Iranians . So they’re not really playing . They’re not really representing Palestinian authentic interest . </s>
They are representing the interest of this crazy Islamist in Iran , and in Damascus . Are they a terror organization ? I think yes , I think all of you should vote for this motion . Now there is this question whether they were democratically elected . Well I would say a broad definition of democracy is you know , doing the will of the people but also observing the rule of law . </s>
And the rule of law does not permit gangs to be brandishing their guns and going with bullets into the ballots . Uh , don’t take just the case of Hamas . Look at what happens . I mean we should apply this global world , global community , the same yardstick for everywhere . </s>
There were elections held in Iraq , in Afghanistan , in the former Yugoslavia . In all these elections , armed gangs were denied the right of voting and also of being elected . </s>
The same case should have been with Hamas but for some reason , this thing was ignored and Hamas was allowed to run . </s>
And I think this was a mistake . Unfortunately , Hamas won but it’s not because the people voted for their ideology – Time’s up . </s>
It’s because it was a protest vote against Fatah which was corrupt and ineffective . So this is the reason why Hamas was elected . </s>
Did it change their character ? </s>
Not at all . Does a formal process change intrinsically what Hamas stand for ? Now after the elections , they still are killing . There are more than a thousand rockets fired from Gaza into our towns , killing babies and children , and there’s no reason for that since we left Gaza entirely . We left Gaza entirely in order to give Palestinians a chance to show everybody that they can govern themselves responsibly . </s>
That they can do away with terror and incitement and start negotiation with us . Time is up . </s>
Just vote for the motion . And the final opening argument is an argument against from Mark Perry . </s>
The problem , the problem isn’t that Hamas is a terrorist organization . The problem is that Hamas is a Muslim organization , that’s what scares the hell out of us . And we ought to put it all out on the table and just say it . And how do we know that ? Because the United States has dealt with terrorist organizations throughout its history and so has Israel . </s>
There were no preconditions for any talks with the PLO in 1993 . </s>
And Yasser Arafat made sure of that . He said , we’ll recognize you after you talk to us . That was no preconditions . Why do we have conditions on Hamas ? </s>
Because they’re Muslims , they don’t look like us , we say they don’t have our values . How do I know that we deal with terrorist organizations ? Because tomorrow the president of the United States is meeting with a man by the name of Nouri al-Maliki . </s>
Who is he ? </s>
Nouri al-Maliki is the head of the Dawa Party . Who is the Dawa Party ? </s>
The Dawa Party opposed Saddam Hussein when we supported Saddam Hussein . We put them on the terrorism list . When we changed sides , we took them off the terrorism list . That doesn’t matter . They bombed the US Embassy in Kuwait and killed three Americans . </s>
We’re talking to him because it’s in our interest to talk to him , terrorist or not . So what is the problem with Hamas ? Well if you listen to the media and if you listen to our political leaders , here’s what they have to say . They don’t have our values . </s>
Our Judeo-Christian values . </s>
What values would those be ? I 'm a nice white boy from Wisconsin , grew up as a Lutheran . </s>
And I can tell you in my religion and I had to memorize through an ordeal the catechism of Martin Luther , one of the real anti-Semites of our era . They do not have a legitimacy . </s>
How do political parties and movements gain legitimacy ? </s>
It’s not conferred by Israel or the United States as conferred by the people . They won an election . Oh no , their critics say . They didn’t win the election , Fatah lost it . </s>
Okay . Fatah lost it because Fatah could n't organize itself credibly and competently to stand for election and because Fatah accepted twenty million dollars in American election aid . And as soon as that came out in The Washington Post and was reprinted in the West Bank in Gaza , they lost votes . </s>
They want to destroy Israel , so did the PLO . They have a charter that says they want to destroy Israel . So do the PLO . And yet we’ve had Hamas leaders that say the following . We have a charter that says , yes we admit it , we want to destroy Israel . </s>
But the charter’s not the Quran , and it can be changed . </s>
And under the right circumstances , if we can talk to our adversaries , we can and we will change it . The other argument that we say , we’ve heard it tonight . They provide social services . </s>
Oh cynical people , how could they do that ? You mean they’re actually trying to serve their people , clear up corruption ? </s>
I too was talking to Hamas leaders when I was in the Middle East . Just one week ago , Osama Hamdan , the foreign minister of Hamas , here’s what they’ve done . They’ve penetrated the Education Health Ministries , cleaned them up , that’s forty percent of the total employment of the government of Palestine . </s>
They’ve thrown out the corrupt people . They’ve taken over the Ministry , they’ve started to provide services to people . </s>
They’ve kicked out Fatah members who are in exile around the world for stealing money from the Palestinian people . Don’t we want good governance ? Should n't we talk to people who want good governance , who stand for elections ? They kill innocent people . </s>
They have killed innocent people , rudely , terribly , like others have . It’s not an excuse to say , well the Israelis have done it . Well Lehi did it . That’s not an excuse . </s>
They’ve killed innocent people and they come out to be absolved . But after long discussions with Hamas , conducted by my organization , painful discussions , arguments about the killing of innocents , not moral arguments , practical , effective , political arguments . They stopped . </s>
I’d like to take credit . They stopped these suicide bombers through talk because they realized how ineffective they were , how they were losing support for what they feel is a legitimate cause . There hasn’t been a Hamas-led suicide bombing in Israel since August of 2004 . </s>
That’s a fact . People can change . There are three conditions for Hamas being recognized as a legitimate political party . To renounce violence , to give up their arms , and to recognize Israel . </s>
We’ve been through this and through this with Hamas , and we’ve said why don’t you do this ? </s>
And the best answer that I’ve had from a Hamas leader is as followed . If we do that , if we renounce violence , if we give up our arms , and if we recognize Israel , what’s there to talk about ? </s>
What do we talk to our enemies about ? Do you think we’re going to say , oh welcome to the world of nations ? </s>
Finally we’ll withdraw to the sixty-seven borders ? Here’s what we would like . We will recognize Israel , Khaled Meshaal has said this very straight forward in Damascus again and again and again and again . </s>
We understand and we recognize that the Israeli people , the Jewish people have a narrative , it’s an important narrative . </s>
We’ve listened to it for many , many years . We have a narrative . </s>
Here’s our narrative . </s>
In 1948 , we lived on a land that was called Palestine . </s>
Many of us were kicked off our land and now live in refugee camps . We have legitimate grievances . If you will recognize our legitimate grievances , and recognize our narrative as a people , we can begin to share a narrative , to have talks . </s>
But until that point comes , when you stand up and say we understand that you have grievances that have to be addressed , we’re not going to recognize anybody . We’re going to represent our people . Now here’s what’s happening , I think , in the Middle East . Now , and I just returned from Beirut . There are , on the internet , calls for the assassination of the leaders of Hezbollah and Hamas by the leaders of Al Qaeda . </s>
Why ? </s>
Because Hamas and Hezbollah have accepted the western , colloidal mandate , to stand for elections and represent their people . Al Qaeda thinks that’s a trick . </s>
Hamas and Hezbollah don’t . They answer to their people . </s>
We are lumping together the Girondists with the Jacobins . We are lumping together the true reformers in the Middle East , the ones who want to answer to their people with the people who drove their airplanes into our buildings . </s>
One . We are forcing the Gironde – for those of you who remember French history – into the mountain , into the Jacobins . It is , it is so counterproductive . We are radicalizing the region . There are moderates in Islam . </s>
They’re called Hamas whether we like it or not . </s>
And it’s time to open up to them . I thank you . Thank you very much to our six debaters , three for and three against . And I 'm now ready to announce to tell you the results of the vote that was taken before tonight’s debate began . </s>
Before the debate , we’ve counted the ballots . One hundred and sixty-one of you voted for the motion . Fifty-one of you voted against the motion . And fifty-six of you said you didn’t know . And to remind , the motion is “A democratically-elected Hamas is still a terrorist organization.” </s>
Again , a hundred and sixty-one in favor , fifty-one against and fifty-six of you said you had not made up your mind . Now we are ready to begin the audience question portion of the program . </s>
I 'm going to call on the questioners . Uh , we have someone on each side of the auditorium here who is going to come to you with a microphone and we ask that you stand uh , when you ask your question . And we also ask that you please make your question short and to the point . We ask that members of the press , identify yourselves , uh , tell us who you are . </s>
And we ask that members of the audience who are not in the press uh , we want to tell you , you have the option to either identify yourself or not . So we will get underway and lets see , we have a question here in the front , yes . WOMAN Um , this is for the people who are for the motion . It seems that the US wants democratically elected uh , governments in the Middle East only if it’s one that they like . </s>
Not just Hamas , but for example the reticence to have free and fair elections in Egypt out of concern that the Muslim Brotherhood would prevail . Isn’t that a little bit hypocritical , and as a corollary to that , when these groups are actually voted in , doesn’t the necessity of governance and the compromises they have to make in order to govern moderate them anyway ? Is that directed at one individual or any one of those ? </s>
WOMAN Mr. O’Sullivan . </s>
Alright . JOHN O’SULLIVAN I , I may take a different view from some of my colleagues on this side of the aisle on this question . Um as a matter of fact , my sticking point is violence . Do you , do groups who are standing for election continue to advocate and practice violence ? </s>
That’s , to me is the sine qua non , if they do , if they maintain a private army , if they are uh , if they are acting as for example , um , the IRA continued to act for some years after the Good Friday agreement , I 'm against that . Now I think in the case of uh , Islamist standing for election , I 'm absolutely in favor of it . I think the American government is taking a risk in , in urging free elections when it will , they’ll sometimes bring to power people who are hostile to American foreign policy . But that’s a risk which we have to take . After all , it’s a risk which we take with every other part of the world and , and we have to live with that . </s>
I think in the case of Hamas , we put ourselves in a somewhat false position and my pos- , and this is a rather complicated point here , but once we had accepted the legitimacy of Hamas standing , it seems to me we had crossed that Rubicon . </s>
And once they , having , their having been elected , we simply had to accept that they were , they were there . I would not have said that they were a legitimate contender in the election myself until , as I say , they’d abandoned violence which is my , in a sense , not my sole criterion , perhaps , but my overriding criterion . </s>
Can I just add something to that Judy ? Sure . On this question of the United States only liking the people that gets elected , and you mentioned the issue of Egypt and since I 'm writing a book about Egypt , I , I , I feel compelled to respond . There’s not a single Egyptian official , nor is there a single American government official who believes who has , that the United States is no longer pressing the Egyptians on democratic reform . </s>
It’s just not true . In fact I was in Cairo in September , and at the same time that the United States government presented papers to the Egyptian government that included benchmarks for democratic change . </s>
And that is even with eighty- eight members of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Egyptian Parliament . </s>
The difference between the Muslim Brotherhood in Hamas is that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has not engaged in an act of violence since at least the 1970s . </s>
You can’t say the same thing about Hamas . Well that’s terrific , they haven’t – Well that’s because there’s , there’s been a million , there’s been a million people that belong to the Muslim Brotherhood and probably two hundred thousand in Egypt that are in jail because they’re – </s>
Hold it , Stanley . As , as soon as the Muslim Brotherhood tries to run for election , they get jailed . </s>
They get tortured . They get , eighty-eight , eighty- eight members . No , no , no , no , come on Stanley . Who’s controlling Egypt ? The Brotherhood ? </s>
We clearly know - No , no . </s>
We clearly know who’s controlling Egypt . The question asked is – It’s certainly not the Muslim Brotherhood . </s>
Do we support democracies – But they did – </s>
And do we oppose democracies that we don’t and the reality of it is – You know - When Musharraf – </s>
Actually you know this . Musharraf became – </s>
You have absolutely no understanding of what the US government is doing right now to promote democracy in the Middle East . </s>
Ask the audience . </s>
This is all very entertaining - They see it every night on television what the United States is doing to promote democracy . If you 're with us , you 're okay . If you 're not , you 're a good Muslim or a bad Muslim , Mr. Bush , it doesn’t change no matter what you want to call it . Who’s going to be the next president of Egypt ? </s>
You think it’s going to be democratically elected ? </s>
Right . Or is it going to be - </s>
Or Jordan , or Jordan . </s>
That other bastion of support , progressive ideology that the Israeli ambassadors supports . You 're good if you 're with us and if you 're not , you 're not . And it really doesn’t matter . </s>
If you follow our politics , you 're a good guy , and if you don’t , you 're trafe . </s>
How is that , expert in Egypt ? Well I think this is , I think that this is really nonsense . </s>
I think we are here talking , you know , in just slogans , democracy and first of all we have to remember , you know elections , democracy doesn’t start with elections , it doesn’t end with elections . There is a culture , there is , there should be a rule of law , there should be a participation of all walks of life in a society . Unfortunately we have a backwards situation in all the Muslim and Arab countries where there is no , basically there is no middle class . </s>
There is only elite who really control all the resources , all the political power , all the economics , and everything else and all the others are poor , uneducated . And they , and really they are subject to the incitement of the ideological zealots from Iran - What an arrogant statement to talk about five thousand year old culture – </s>
Stanley , chill out , you’ll get an opportunity . I 'm talking about facts , I 'm just talking about facts . </s>
So what I , what I would answer to you is no , we should not promote democracy in the Middle East . </s>
What we should promote is equal opportunities . What we should promote is empowerment of women . </s>
What we should p- , uh , promote is good education for the people so there’s not these inequalities . And when the people themselves will have a stake in their own lives , in their societies , they will decide what type of regime they do want . What the ambassador means to say is , there wo n't be a vote until the people are ready which is just exactly what J. Edgar Hoover said about African Americans in America – MAN Please . </s>
Thirty years ago . This has nothing to do with that and uh , irrelevant . </s>
Just a quick comment on this , with all due respect to the ambassador – And then we’ll get to the next question . Yeah , I , I , this is precisely what I meant by unilateral understanding . We , I mean we , here again , we have to decide this , we have to support , we have , it’s , it’s , it’s very , very materialistic . It’s as if all of these populations have no sense of what is important to them , what is legitimate for them , who stands for them . </s>
I mean Fatah has lost all credibility in that , in that area not simply because of external support , essentially for what they’ve done with the b-building of apartments in Dubai and so on and so forth . </s>
The people know who stands for them , people know who will defend them . </s>
And if Hamas has left that scene which was , as I said , a military scene as , and has chosen to represent the democratic , uh , in a democratic way this , these groups , then it’s something that speaks for the values of these people . And keep in mind as well , who was fielded in these elections . Pharmacists , doctors , professors , I mean business , women , this is not simply a group of , as you called them earlier , “thugs in limousines.” Khaled Meshaal , last weekend at his , last week in his press conference , was citing Foreign Affairs articles by Richard Haass . I mean we really have to be a little bit more sophisticated – </s>
We’ve had – Let me just mention to you , you 're mentioning – Good discussion now on this question and I think we do need to move to the next – No but this is very important Judy . </s>
We can get each of you – I think it’s important because they keep raising this issue of – </s>
Well – </s>
Being pharmacists and doctors . </s>
Yes . And all that , let me tell you – Just because you 're a pharmacist – There are millions – </s>
Doesn’t mean you 're not a terrorist . There are millions of engineers and doctors . Osama Bin Laden is a civil engineer , come on . And professors and musicians in the thirties who voted for the Nazi party which brought on the Holocaust . </s>
I think that’s an unfair – With doctors – Lawyers , pharmacists . Professors – And the guy who – President of the United States , it begs the question . </s>
And what they believe in , this is what should be the yardstick . </s>
Alright . Not their diplomas . </s>
As long as the Iranians and Syrians tell them what to do , is that correct ? We are going - As long as the Iranians the Syrians tell them… We are not going to resolve this now , we need to let the next person have a question . </s>
Yes , I believe , yes sir , you’ve been patiently waiting . </s>
MAN Hi , my question is for the against side , specifically for the gentleman who have had direct conversations with Hamas . If Hamas refuses to recognize Israel , how can the organization support a two-state solution ? Well long before there was Hamas , you know you got to , governments say things all the time . People say things all the time . If Hamas tomorrow said , we recognize the state of Israel or the right of Israel to exist , the ambassador would say prove it . </s>
Come back to us in twenty years , when you’ve shown we’ll accept it for twenty years . The reality of it is , I 'm not concerned about what people say they will do , I 'm more concerned about what in fact they do , do , and on the ground . The reality of it is that you’ve got statements that have come as close as they’re going to come . </s>
That talk about if we go back to the sixty-seven borders , that is the starting point and that’s where we’re going to move . Everyday the United States government makes statements . </s>
There’s weapons of mass destruction , we go in through Iraq . You know what , no weapons of mass destruction . </s>
Don’t get hung up on the rhetoric of labels , don’t get hung up on we recognize your right to exist . What about recognizing the right of return ? Stanley Cohen can go home , but if my name is Mahmoud , I can’t go home . </s>
So you have to be reciprocal . </s>
I haven’t heard a word from Israel about the right of return , I haven’t heard a word from Israel about the right to a government , I haven’t heard a word from Israel about the right to recognize what the Palestinian people want . You’ll hear it pretty soon from me - We want unilateral concessions . Can I , can I answer to that ? Well don’t judge us and don’t tell me what Israel will say for twenty more years . </s>
Just judge us by our deeds . When Egypt was ready to recognize Israel , we signed a peace treaty , the same with Jordan , the same with the PLO , and I take issue , I think it’s incorrect what you mentioned here . Israel was ready to recognize the PLO and talk to them only and only after Yitzhak Rabin received a letter signed by Yasser Arafat , ninth of September , ’93 , which renounced terror , which recognized Israel’s right to exist , and which also promised to change this charter that you were talking about . This is exactly what we’re expecting from Hamas . And this is not just an Israeli expectation , this is a demand by the entire international community as was expressed by the quartet , the four parties that are responsible for the peace process in the Middle East . </s>
Which called for the Hamas after they were elected , they said okay , you were elected , it doesn’t matter if it was democratically or not , it doesn’t matter if you 're a terror organization , lets look and move forward . And Israel is in that camp , lets look and move forward , not about what you did , the fact that you already fired Qassam rockets this morning , killing a baby in Sderot . Lets look to the future and we still say , if you renounce terror , if you recognize Israel’s right to exist and you abolish your charter . </s>
And now also if you accept our previous agreements which were signed by the PLO , then you are a le- , legitimate parter , partner . But they’re not doing that because they’re still a terror organization , because they do not believe in coexistence and they do believe not in building a nation but destroying one , which is ours . And we are not going to let them do that . You 're talking about , Stanley Cohen , about the right of return . </s>
What kind of right of return ? There’s no right of return . There are , there were Arabs there which we wanted to coexist with them , but they refused - It’s all , it’s all , it’s all a conspiracy between Iran and Syria . </s>
Eight hundred thousand people just woke up and moved . </s>
Just read , just read the history , just read the history and then you will know , there is not such a thing as right of return . There is a problem of the refugees , this is true . There is a refugee problem , but the responsibility for the refugee problems lie on the heads of the leaders of the Palestinians and of the Arabs . Alright . </s>
We have a question , I see a hand right there . My name is Michael Brown , I 'm a freelance writer . There’s something that seems very myopic about this conversation with the war raging in Iran and , and Lebanon . This , this sort of insoluble binary seems to have spread to the whole world in terms of who’s a terrorist , who’s a democrat , who’s right and who’s wrong . </s>
You hear repeatedly that the key to peace of a region and the world is in the Israel-Palestine conflict . </s>
This is for anyone in the panel , if you still think that that’s true . For anyone on the panel . Yeah . </s>
Alright we’ll , we’ll begin with this side because we heard last . </s>
Well I think you , and let me if I may , remind us of the motion that this debate is not about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict , the motion is about the last ten months and it , whether Hamas is still a terrorist organization . And the facts are that everything that Hamas did over the past month , ten months can not be qualified as terrorist . </s>
I mean you can come up with – Indiscriminate firing at children – Well – Schools , they’re all – </s>
It’s interesting you should say that , you know I , because when you look at it , you will find out that , sir , I think you should know that , this was actually the violations that came , came from the Fatah side . And the Fatah was associated with that as well as – Not at all . Ghazi Hamad is the name of the person that actually speaks about these matters and you can go and check and , and see every one of the actions that was in violation was denounced by Hamas officially . So again , facts or statements ? </s>
MAN Who holds Corporal Shalit which was kidnapped in our territory ? Well I would n't know . It’s the Hamas . </s>
What you would n't know – Who holds the ten thousand Palestinians sitting in jails that haven’t seen – MAN But who holds – They are all terrorists and this is the difference . </s>
They’re all terrorists ? MAN Thirty-seven legislators – All ten thousand of them . Oh absolutely . All ten thousand Palestinians including the fourteen-year-old – </s>
Let me tell you that – </s>
Then what are you afraid of ? Put them on trial . Let me tell you that they are not – Put them on trial . </s>
It’s not just the ten thousand there . </s>
You have a democracy . There are fifty thousand more . You have a democracy . Mm-hmm . </s>
Let them go , let them have trials . They are all – Prove your case . They are all being trialed , they are all being processed . </s>
MAN Let me , let me – And I wish the same chance was given to the Israeli kids that are being targeted by these guys . </s>
Oops . </s>
I know there we go again , every time those darn Palestinians get in the way of our missiles and our tanks and end up dead . Whoops , there it goes again . But yet when we do it , we’re sorry . But you , you target and that’s the moral superiority . </s>
So the mor- , the moral position that you’ve always taken . Look , it’s terrible when civilians on both sides get killed . It’s terrible , it’s got to stop and the way you stop it is you dare to struggle . You break the labels , you sit down with no preconditions and you try to move ahead . </s>
And if it doesn’t work , you 're right back to where you were but at least there’s a chance . Absolutely , this is exactly what we want . We , we say stop the killing , stop the terror and we will sit and talk . And what about your side ? Question . </s>
What we will talk about , what we will talk about ? The road map to peace . We only have about four minutes left for questions so I do want to recognize someone there in the very back , please , stand up . MAN I have a question . </s>
My name is Goldin and I 'm a teacher . I have a question to Mr. Cohen . If your argument Hamas , with that said , with everything going on according to your plan and you would be , would you go for even a short visit to Israel just to recognize , just to receive congratulation ? </s>
Would you take such a risk ? </s>
I go to Israel all the time . In fact , in fact sir , sir… Sir , I lost family in a bombing in Jerusalem , I lost family in World War II , I can not tell you how difficult it is for me as a Jew to sit back and for sixty years , watch what has occurred – And not just in the name of people in Israel , but in the names of Jews all over the world . The answer is yes , I would go , and yes I would gladly do what has to be done to break bread and to try to bring some sanity to this war of labeling . </s>
That’s the problem . We are so locked into labels , we are so locked into an inability . You must do this or I’ll do that , I must do this or you’ll do that . </s>
There’s absolutely no down side to sitting down without preconditions and talking . MAN Absolutely . John O’Sullivan . </s>
John O’Sullivan has been asking – JOHN O’SULLIVAN I think that there is , just on the general point here , there are consequences to launching unsuccessful wars against Israel . The first is that Israel ends up with territories which didn’t originally belong to it , the second is that there are going to be large numbers of refugees , and the third is that the Israelis , given their strategic , long-term vulnerability are going to be very suspicious of proposals for peace that don’t come accompanied by guarantees . </s>
But do come accompanied by demands for a right of return that would negate the Jewish state altogether . Okay . We , we have time for one more audience question , preferably a short one , and please tell us who it’s directed to and lets see . </s>
Where do we , do we have someone with a microphone up there ? </s>
Okay , go ahead . MAN I’d like to ask two brief questions , and I’d like to thank Mr. O’Sullivan – Let’s make it one . MAN Okay . We have two minutes . </s>
MAN I’d like to thank Mr. O’Sullivan and Mr. Perry for I think making the most uh , intelligent arguments tonight . Um , I just want to ask the For side how they , if they feel that political power is a uh , moderating force on uh , extremists . </s>
And how their view of terrorism uh , is consistent with the actions of David Ben-Gurion and the bombing of the King David Hotel . Who would like to pick , Steven ? MAN I’ll – Steven Cook . I’ll go for it , thank you very much . </s>
Um , I think that there’s really no condition . The pothole theory of politics , that somehow Hamas , which is dedicated to a broader , ideological agenda , is someone going to have to pick up the garbage , that that is going to moderate their view of the world . That certainly didn’t happen with the PLO once it returned to Gaza , I do n't expect it will happen with Hamas . </s>
Now of course the question of bomb , of the King David Hotel , everybody trucks that out as , as evidence of terrorism , the fact that the , the Israeli , Israelis before , in the pre- state era engaged in terrorism . My understanding of the bombing of the King David Hotel was that it was not directed specifically against innocent civilians , but it was against British occupation , authorities . That is not consistent with the definition of terrorism . INTERVIEWER Alright . </s>
Uh , thank – JOHN O’SULLIVAN There , there were terrorist acts against British troops , during the war , by the way , just to make that point . Oh . Alright , it is now , it is now time for all of you in the audience , this is the moment , this is time to vote . </s>
This is the ticket , pull it out of your pocket or your lap , wherever it is , your handbag . If you want to vote for the motion , tear off the “For , ” the green For from the ticket , the top of the ticket , and slip it into the ballet box that will be passed among you . If you want to vote against , tear off “Against , ” the red . Tear off the red Against and put that into the ballot box . </s>
And if you do not know which side you 're on , if you are undecided , put your entire ticket into the ballot box . </s>
The ballot boxes are going to be passed around the ushers , the front and the back of the auditorium . Pass it to the next person , we want to make sure everybody’s vote is counted . If you need a ticket , just wave your arm in the air , the ushers have extra tickets . Everyone gets one vote . And now we’re going to turn , while you 're finishing this up , we’re going to turn to the panelists , beginning with the side opposing the motion . </s>
And we are going to ask them to make their final argument . </s>
So opposing the motion , against , Stanley Cohen . Two minutes . Sure a lot more difficult debating here than it was in Qatar or in Doha . </s>
I have a friend , dear friend of mine , believe it or not , an Israeli . Named Leah Tsemel , famous Israeli lawyer , she used to be called Arafat’s whore by Israeli politicians . </s>
Leah said to me one day when we were driving to the Erez crossing where we had to wait twelve hours to go in to see people , Leah said in response to a comment about how they want to drive us to the sea and drown us , Leah said the only one who’s going to drive us to the sea and drown us is ourselves . The notions that Palestinians have nothing to do but to die or to kill after all of this time is the difficulty . We see resistance as this desire and this need to be terrorists , to die and kill which is defied by what’s happening on the ground . </s>
The real shame here , the real sin here is for the first time in history , Palestinian and Israeli kids aren’t going to schools together . They’re not spending time together , they’re not falling in love together , they’re not doing businesses together . </s>
And the problem is the walls of labels are keeping sides apart . </s>
People say Hamas is a terrorist organization , I say Israel is a terrorist state . </s>
Who cares ? </s>
The two sides need to sit down without preconditions , see if you can find common ground as people to grow so those kids can fall in love again , thank you very much . And now for the motion , Steven A. Cook . </s>
It’s amazing , isn’t it ? Everything I told you would happen , happened . Our interlocutors on the other side did not address the issue at hand , they shifted to Israeli behavior . But I want to respond to some specific things that each of them said to demonstrate how weak their arguments are . </s>
And since Stanley impugned my credibility and my expertise , I’ll return the favor . </s>
Stanley spoke passionately ponytail waving , arms in the air , doing the whole hippie thing , talking about many or most in the world believe . </s>
Come on Stanley , I got my Ph.D. because , I didn’t need to go to law school because I 'm the son of a lawyer . You should know every first year law student knows that when you argue “many in the world , ” “most in the world , ” “most people believe , ” it’s a logical fallacy . Just because most people believe it doesn’t make it true . </s>
What is Mahmoud talking about when he talks about protorecognition ? </s>
Is that like being half pregnant ? You can’t be half pregnant , you either recognize or you don’t . </s>
I had , throughout the 1990s , I spent my time parsing the words of Palestinian leaders , do they or do they not recognize , what is protorecognition ? Hudna means somehow recognition , but hudna’s in . I do n't understand it . The majority of the Palestinians did not vote for Hamas . </s>
Forty-four percent of the people voted for Hamas . </s>
Now I 'm sure the people on the other side of the room would say that George Bush was not democratically elected because the majority of Americans didn’t vote for him in 2000 . </s>
Well I would apply the same principle to Hamas . I 'm shocked , I 'm actually shocked that Mark Perry’s interlocutor is Osama – Fifteen seconds . </s>
Oh I’ll skip that part . I’ll just say , I’ll just say that it is extraordinary that Mark Perry gave all the evidence you needed to vote for the proposition . He said his Hamas interlocutor said that they would not give up violence because it’s a bargaining chip . Time’s up . </s>
So thus the lives of innocents is a bargaining chip , it’s a political power player on the part of Hamas . They will continue their terrorism , thank you . I urge you to vote For . Oh you’ve already voted , so thanks for your vote . Against the motion , Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou . </s>
Thank you very much . Well I had a bit of an uplifting argument to finish with but I guess that unfortunately we’ve moved from intelligent debate to acuteness , apparently winning it . And it’s a pity because the whole debate was not necessarily about this pro- Israeli or pro-Arab or pro-Palestinian . It’s really something different . It was about justice , people fighting for justice are not terrorists , it’s about international legality , wars of national liberation are not terrorism . </s>
And it’s about the cogency of our moral principles . But it seems that all of this uh , sort of um , again acuteness that was adopted to address these life and death matters seems to have won the room and you know , fine . But again back to Stanley’s point , history marches on . </s>
Um and although one might think that there’s something inevitable about the Arab , Israeli conflict , I for one would like to believe that it’s not . Imagine if the EU were to call a Hamas delegation or have an adult conversation with them . </s>
Imagine if the Secretary of State were to address elected officials and , and invite them and discuss with them . Imagine if the Israeli population elected a government from which they asked and then to implement policies and negotiations with whomever is in charge . This I think would quell the violent , violence on both sides , resuscitate the peace talks , and get us into a new dynamic . You don’t have to imagine the opposite situation . </s>
We’re in it and we’ll continue to be in it as long as motions such as tonight , such as tonight’s will continue to let it . Thank you . Okay . For the motion , John O’Sullivan . </s>
JOHN O’SULLIVAN Well I 'm delighted that there are distinguished psychiatrists , doctors , lawyers and so on in Hamas , and at the moment Radovan Karadzic is on the run from NATO as a war criminal . He himself was a child psychiatrist before the war started . I wonder what became of his charges . </s>
It’s unusual for me to find myself as the idealist on the platform , but I point out that the argument that we should be having as well as the particular argument about the Middle East is an argument about violence in politics . When violence enters politics , it’s very hard to drive it out again . </s>
And when indiscriminate violence against innocent people enters , it damages the society very strongly indeed . Now that’s not the only way to have a revolution . Polish solidarity won independence from Russia . </s>
And that has been repeated in Georgia and in the Ukraine and elsewhere by a campaign of moral resistance and cultural resistance that wore down the opposition and persuaded people to come over to it . </s>
That’s the , that’s the kind of revolution if the , if one is needed . That’s the kind of revolution , recourse that we should encourage people to pursue . </s>
We should not turn a blind eye to their crimes because they have managed to be elected . It’s a fine thing to be elected , but it doesn’t absolve you from the laws of human conduct that the rest of us are supposed to obey . And our final argument against , Mark Perry . We wo n't be here two years from now , two years from now debating this question because by two years from now this , this debate will be resolved . Why ? </s>
Because Israel will be talking to Hamas , that’s why . Because they’re talking to them right now . </s>
How do we know that ? Because there is a proposed cease-fire in Gaza in which Khaled Meshaal traveled to Cairo and Ehud Olmert said , if you can stop those rockets , we’ll withdraw from Gaza . </s>
Now that might not be eyeball to eyeball talk but that’s a political understanding . And how did that happen ? It happened because George Bush was going to Amman , Jordan and Dick Cheney is going to Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , to talk to those guys about helping us out in Iraq and they’re looking at him and saying how are we going to do that when our own people are making a clamor about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict ? And so George Bush and Dick Cheney are picking up the phone and calling Prime Minister Olmert and he’s saying , what ? I can’t , they’re a terrorist organization . </s>
George Bush is going to go , oh come on . Where do you think this is ? </s>
Grow up , be adults . We’ve got a world to run . You want to run it ? </s>
Talk to people , talk to them . </s>
They might be a terrorist organization , yes they’ve killed civilians , yes it’s a terrible thing . After World War II , we went into Germany and put three hundred and thirty-four people on trial and called it a day . </s>
Why ? </s>
Because we have to go forward , and it’s time to go forward . It’s time to go forward , thank you . And our final debater for the motion , Ambassador Daniel Ayalon . Yes . Thank you , well what was the issue today ? </s>
The issue was of little moral and practical nature . </s>
Legally , are they law offenders ? They have illegal arms , they breached the law , yes , Hamas does . Moral issue . Are they killers of children and other innocent people , yes they are . And of practical issue , just a matter of common sense , is there any sense talking to them ? </s>
Will talking to them bring peace and quiet ? Well I do n't think so . Now we have to make sure the equation is right , and it’s not that they will say well we will stop killing you if you give us land , if you give us political concession . This is not the equation . </s>
If they stop killing us , we will stop hunting them . When they are ready for political concessions , we will give them political concessions . It’s apple to apple , oranges to oranges . This is the issue and so long as the Palestinians and Hamas especially , deny recognition of Israel’s right to be there in their homeland , there’s not going to peace , to be peace . </s>
And the fact that they continued with this uh , terror , and some would call it resistance is also a fallacy because it’s not resistance . Israel is ready to uh , to build a Palestinian state . Israel was withdrawing from territories , the entire area of Gaza , areas of the West Bank . And we are willing to talk . </s>
What , what are we going to talk about ? The road map to peace , how to make peace , how to create a Palestinian state which will live side by side with a Jewish Israel . This is at stake now , and so long as the Palestinians do not want to do that , as long as they keep the killing , there’s nothing to talk about . </s>
They stop the killing , then we talk . Alright , I want to thank all of our debaters , I want to thank all of you in the audience for your excellent questions and your good behavior . It’s time now to announce the results of the voting after our debaters did the very best job they could to sway you . Here’s the number that we have . </s>
A hundred and fifty-nine voted for the motion , one hundred voted against which is a , almost a doubling of what it was before . And fifty-two said I do n't know . </s>
So again , a hundred and fifty-nine for , a hundred , that means that a number of you didn’t vote when you first came in . That’s , it , it looks as if we’ve got forty-nine , fifty , fifty or so more people who voted uh , at the end . Uh , but again we appreciate the participation of all of our debaters , we thank you in the audience , I want to invite you to return next month for the fourth Intelligence Squared US debate on Wednesday , December 13th here at the Asia Society and Museum . The motion to be debated is Hollywood has promoted anti-Americanism abroad . </s>

Please check your local NPR member station listings for the date and the time of broadcast outside New York City . Copies of Mahmoud Ould Mohamedou’s book , Understanding Al Qaeda , and John O’Sullivan’s new book , The President , the Pope , and the Prime Minister . </s>
Those are for sale upstairs in the lobby . Please also be sure to pick up a complimentary copy of The Times of London , that’s on the table outside the auditorium doors . Thank you all for your support of Intelligence Squared US . I want to thank you all very , very much for making it out this evening and for making this a sellout , the first night of the new series . </s>
And I would like to turn it over to Chris Browne of Rockefeller University . Thank you very much . I’m Chris Browne , I’m a member of the Board of Trustees here at The Rockefeller University . A universally world-renowned center for research in the biomedical and biological sciences . </s>
I’m also a supporter of Intelligence Squared US and a long-time friend of its chairman , Bob Rosenkranz . </s>
We’ve known each other for so long that I won’t admit how long . But it’s been a while . It’s a special pleasure for me to welcome you this evening , in which two organizations I admire are working together . </s>
Rockefeller is providing the new and larger venue , enabling Intelligence Squared to better meet the demand for the elevated public discourse it supplies . Bob Rosenkranz will now be joining us , via videotape , to frame tonight’s discussion . Thank you , and welcome . </s>
In the upcoming political campaign , we’re going to hear an awful lot about health care . The 45 million uninsured , are cited as a national scandal . And the efficiency of our current system is very questionable . Our current health care system , consumes about 50 to 100 percent bigger piece of our national output , than health care in other rich countries , with very , very little to show for it , in the way of improved outcomes . </s>
Those who favor a federally mandated universal coverage , argue that , it will produce greater efficiency , as the federal government drives private-sector costs down . It’ll promote better health outcomes , as we are able to have more early intervention , and more preventive medicine , and it’s more fair to the disadvantaged people in our society who are not getting the full benefits of , of health care coverage that our country can provide . On the other side of the argument , are those that rarely link the terms “efficient” and “government” in the same sentence . They see the problem as grossly exaggerated . Of the 45 million uninsured , many are young people who are relatively healthy , people who can easily afford medical coverage but elect not to buy insurance , illegal immigrants , and people who are eligible for Medicaid but have not enrolled . </s>
They think that the inefficiencies in the system , are caused by the fact that most consumers of medical care don’t pay for the service directly , and therefore , have no incentive to control costs . And finally on the subject of fairness , universal care may be seen as simply a way of compelling healthy young people , to subsidize the cost of providing health care to their less healthy elders . </s>
To discuss these very timely matters we have a truly outstanding panel with us tonight , and it’s my real pleasure to introduced John Donvan , our new moderator , and the radio voice of Intelligence Squared , on the 150 National Public Radio stations that carry these debates . John is an Emmy Award-winning journalist , with 20 years at ABC News , most recently at Nightline . He’s been a White House correspondent , and a foreign correspondent , in Moscow , Jerusalem , Amman , Iraq . John , the evening is yours . Thank you , Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
And I would also like to invite a round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz whose vision makes these evenings possible , normally he’s here in person but— I am John Donvan , your host and moderator , for Intelligence Squared US , I am with ABC News Nightline but tonight it is a pleasure to be introducing and moderating these debates , Intelligence Squared US , Oxford-style debating on America’s shores , the motion for tonight’s debate as you know , “Universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility.” You are going to be hearing from six panelists throughout the program , three who are for this motion , and three of whom are against , we’re going to have a three-part debate , the first part , the most substantial part in a certain way will be opening statements , each of the speakers in turn will be given seven minutes to make the case , I want to clue you in there is a sound that you will hear at the six-minute mark , it’s a warning sound telling them that they’re running out of time and it sounds like— Very gentle sound , and— It can become more insistent and at the seven-minute mark it will become rather relentless like this . </s>
All righty . </s>
All righty . We’re going to poll you both before and after the debate because , the point here , is to win the room . These debaters are trying to persuade you to their point of view , everyone comes in here with a point of view or the absence of a point of view known as undecided . We’re going to poll you to find out what our baseline is coming in but this is in a sense a contest , it’s not quite a reality show but it is a contest , it’s a contest of wits and facts and information and persuasion , and all of you are the umpires , you are the referees , you are the judges in this . </s>
We will also , later in the program , after the opening statements , we’ll be coming to you for questions , and then the evening concludes with each of the debaters taking two minutes to sum up and reach a summary position , at that point we will vote again , to find out how they did , who were the winners of the evening . So , once again the topic , to reiterate , “Universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility , ” if you go to the keypads attached to your seats at this point…number 1 means that you are for the motion , number 2 , you are against the motion , number 3 , you at this point are undecided . Please vote . Does anyone need more time ? </s>
It was pretty simple . So in a short time we’ll have the results to share with you but we want to begin now , with the opening statements , once again our topic , “Universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility , ” and arguing first for the motion , Paul Krugman , a well-known op-ed columnist for the New York Times and I want to point out that in an era when many of us were beginning to refer to our potatoes as Freedom Fries , Paul Krugman stood up and talked about the French when it comes to health care , in some ways , doing it better than the United States , and the Germans , and the Koreans…Paul Krugman , the podium is yours . Thank you . So I’m an economist which means I’m supposed to talk about efficiency , but I actually want to start , by talking about morality . And in fact I don’t want to start by talking about health care . </s>
Let me talk about something that’s going on right now . As we sit here there are several million people in the Houston metropolitan area , who are without electricity or running water . Been hit by disaster , they didn’t do anything wrong . They stayed in their houses because that was what they were advised by the governor of Texas to do , it was the right thing to do given the impossibility of evacuating a city that size and now , a lot of them are in trouble . </s>
Some of them can manage , some of them can now go and stay with relatives , some are in good health and , others are not , they’re in a lot of trouble . </s>
Now , do we think that the people who are in trouble , who are elderly , who are in poor health , who just don’t have the financial resources , whatever , to get themselves out of that situation , do we believe that , well look , you know , it’s not a government responsibility to help them , they should be left on their own . Well of course we don’t , I mean , I imagine there are some people who do believe that , but not many . They certainly don’t show their heads in our American politics . We do believe that if our fellow citizens suffer misfortune that is no fault of their own , and we can help them , that we should . Now imagine , some American who is in poor health and can’t afford medical care . </s>
Some American who is elderly and in need , trouble , or maybe not elderly , something’s gone wrong , someone who is trying to work but can’t get a job that has health insurance , someone who is in difficulty . Do we believe that that’s their problem , that we should not be taking care of them . And by the way , we’re not just talking about the 45 million without health insurance . We’re also talking about the roughly 75 million people who have inadequate health insurance . Health insurance that basically crumples , whenever it’s put to the need , we’re talking about a large part of this country , that does not have adequate health care coverage . </s>
Well I would submit to you that actually as a nation , we don’t believe that it’s appropriate to leave these people on their own . That we actually believe that the right thing to do is to help people , we don’t think that people should be protected from all of the risks of life but when there is something you can do , we believe that we should do it . And in fact by and large , if you ask people , should people have health coverage in this country , should people be guaranteed health care , most polls I’ve seen say that a heavy majority of the public thinks that they should . </s>
So then the question would be , well how is it that we don’t actually have that , how is it that we haven’t actually taken care of our citizens in the way that overwhelmingly , as a nation , we believe is the morally right thing to do , that as a matter of values , we think we oughta do . And the answer is of course that we’re told…well actually we’re told two things . </s>
We’re told first of all , that we already do it . </s>
That we already take care of everybody , and we’re also told , that it’s impossible to take care of everybody . Now you might think that it was impossible to believe both those things at the same time but , that’s why these guys are paid the big bucks . So we’re told that , well , look— And I can quote the President there . “I mean people have got access to health care in America . After all you just go to an emergency room.” </s>
And of course -- I think we probably have a fair number of doctors here right -- you know , it ain’t the same thing . First of all , going into emergency is no substitute for continuing care . And secondly , if you go to an emergency room , they will bill you . Now if you’re indigent , we’ve got the care all the same but you will get the bill and if you’re indigent maybe that doesn’t matter , but , for working Americans who don’t have good incomes , they’re terrified of emergency room coverage , and it’s—there’s something sick about our debate , that anybody can even claim that the emergency room is a substitute for universal health care . </s>
But the other argument is that it’s impossible . That if you try to have some form of universal health care , it’ll be terrible . </s>
It’ll be lousy quality , it’ll be wildly expensive . </s>
So people are told that a government insurance system can’t possibly work . It will be lousy insurance , it’ll be awful , it’ll lead to awful care… Which , now we’re going to hear a little bit I think later on about some of the international evidence , we’re going to hear about other countries . But you know , I—there’s a secret , I don’t know if people know about it but you know , there’s this program called Medicare . </s>
Covers every American 65 and older . </s>
It is , horrors , it’s a single-payer health insurance system run by the federal government . </s>
When it was being proposed , people said it would be terrible . You may have heard of something called Operation Kaffeeklatsch . Or you may not have heard of it . Doctors’ wives were urged to hold kaffeeklatsches , in which they would try to convince the doctors’ patients what a terrible idea this proposal called Medicare was , and they would play a recording by a fellow named Ronald Reagan , explaining what a terrible idea Medicare was and how it would lead , not only to destruction of health care , but actually the destruction of freedom , it’s quite something , you can listen to it online and , at the end , it basically says Medicare is the root to a totalitarian state . Well , it’s become as American as apple pie . </s>
Famous quote among , in the health care field is the , constituent who accosted Senator John Breaux saying , Senator , don’t let the government get its hands on Medicare . The fact of the matter is we have universal health coverage for our elderly already . The other thing that people say is that it would be impossibly expensive . </s>
Now , the truth is , a little-known other big secret , really have to go in deep research and actually look at a couple of official statistics that are easily available to find this out— In this country , the government already pays more health care bills than private insurers do . Medicare and Medicaid together , are already a bigger program than private insurance , all private health insurance . The reason is that we already cover the expensive cases . We already have the expensive cases . </s>
The elderly , the very sick who end up being bankrupted and therefore end up poor enough to get Medicaid are covered by public programs . What’s left , are generally lower-income working adults , and we pay an enormous amount to not cover them . </s>
The fact of the matter is that our health care system is wildly inefficient , largely because we have an insurance industry that devotes enormous resources to try to identify who really needs health insurance , so as not to give it to them . And we have health care providers devoting enormous resources , fighting with the insurance companies , to actually get paid . And the result is a wildly inefficient system . It would be cheaper , by far , to just cover everybody . We pay this huge price because we’ve managed to convince ourselves , or be convinced , that somehow , something that every other advanced country does , and that every other—that we do ourselves for the elderly , is impossible . </s>
Thank you— Paul Krugman , thank you very much . </s>
Pretty well- timed actually . Speaking against the motion , John Stossel , my colleague from ABC News , but we did not discuss this ahead of time , in fact , though both of us have worked a quarter-century at ABC News we’ve never met until tonight . Bizarrely enough , separate orbits I suppose . I kept my feet on the ground . John Stossel’s hard-nosed take on many a liberal policy assumption is summed up in his catch-phrase , “ Gim me a break.” </s>
Tonight in a sense we’re discussing , what if you break your arm , or your neck…should the federal government be there to provide your insurance safety net , John Stossel , here to argue against that idea and the motion tonight . It is intuitive to think that it should , that we have…very poor and helpless people and it’s the job of government , to help them , and , actually we have that , we have Medicaid . If you are poor , you are covered in America . It’s not a good system . </s>
It’s tempting to think that a wise government could step in . Paul Krugman has just said look at Medicare , people like Medicare . And that’s true . </s>
But , of course they like it , because , it gives you stuff free . People like that . But it’s unsustainable , it’s $ 35 trillion in the hole . </s>
That’s the unfounded liability of Medicare . They made promises to cover us when we’re 75 , when the panel is 75 , there’s no way they can possibly do that . </s>
Right now it’s working , because there are lots of young people and relatively few older people , but there’s just no way it can be sustained , if a private company tried to run its pension system that way I bet they’d throw the owners in jail . It’s a Ponzi scheme . Now , some people will talk tonight about the widely publicized data that America spends the most on health care , and we do , and studies have found that we have the worst result . </s>
But those studies are deceitful . They compare us by how long we live . But Americans are different . We drive cars more . </s>
We kill each other more often . Our accident rate , deaths on the highways triple that of the United Kingdom , we murder each other 10 times as often as the United Kingdom . When you take that out , we live longer than those other countries . And that doesn’t even include , diet issues , because we eat more and that kills people . </s>
A lot of these studies are skewed to make America look bad . Now many people say that the perfect system is in Europe where you have universal health care , and it’s true—most other countries do have systems like that . And it gets rid of the horrible anxiety that some people have in America , will I be covered . And that is horrible , and that does make people sick . But it’s better to be anxious , than to be in horrible pain . </s>
Or to be dead . And these universal coverage systems , they don’t guarantee universal access to actual care . In Canada , more than a million families can’t get a doctor . </s>
We taped in one town in Ontario where they have a lottery , they have a little box , everybody puts the family name in and , the town clerk pulls out a name , oh , you get to see a doctor this week . There aren’t enough doctors to go around , in Britain , one in eight patients waits more than a year for treatment in a hospital . The journal Clinical Oncology says 20 percent of potentially curable lung cancer patients , become incurable on the waiting list . Now why does this happen , well , because when everything is free , when the government pays for it…everybody wants everything . But the government doesn’t have infinite money so the government then must ration . </s>
And they do it by not giving you the latest , most expensive stuff , or they make you wait in line . In one town in England they opened a , a new office where you could get dental treatment , people lined up for blocks . Now most of them didn’t get in , so people pull their own teeth . </s>
The dental tools are pliers and vodka . This is not a good way to live . Still , despite the fact they spend less , European care is not remarkably inferior , it’s pretty good for most people . </s>
But that’s true only because they freeload off of us . Because most of the innovation comes from America . </s>
From the greedy profit-driven companies that want to take as much money from you as they possibly can , they’re the ones who gave us so much good stuff , the MRI’s , the CT scans . ACE inhibitors to lower blood pressure . The statins like Lipitor , to reduce cholesterol , coronary bypass surgery , hip replacement , knee replacement . What will the world be like if we have universal care and we don’t have America to invent those things ? </s>
Yes , the private market is awful in many ways and wasteful . Health insurance companies waste all this money on advertising , paperwork , duplication , claims officers trying to make sure you’re not cheating ‘em . It is intuitive to think a single payer would be more efficient . </s>
And Michael Rachlis who will speak shortly has written that , a public bureaucracy is cheaper . And , I used to believe that , when I attended Paul Krugman’s university I was taught that , that the wise elites in Washington and state capitol can plan these things better than these competing companies . But then I became a consumer reporter , and I watched the market work . </s>
I watched government and private greedy companies trying to deliver services to people . And now I say that’s nonsense , government can’t do anything even close to the efficient way that private companies do it . When government pays for things , people don’t change , they don’t innovate , they keep doing the same thing they did to get paid . So , as an example look at the inefficiency of the private car companies . </s>
They waste millions in advertising on my program , I’m glad they do . And they run these gross ads , they sell cars not based on their engineering perfection or safety , they sell sex and muscle cars . They have these competing dealerships and pushy salesmen selling things like rust-proofing that we don’t need . Despite all of that , what’s the worst you get when you buy a car in New York ? </s>
The worst you can get , is better than this , this is what the planned economies…universal coverage gives us , and I apologize to those of you on the radio , you can’t see I’m holding up a picture of the Trabant , that East German car . This was the best those brilliant East German engineers could produce , it was an awful car , you had to put the oil and gas separately and shake the car to mix ‘em together . As soon as the Berlin Wall went down , this disappeared , because it couldn’t compete with the mediocre products that produced—were produced by our competing companies . I don’t want to have this kind of health care , and that’s what we’ll get if government runs it , at the beginning , government could do things well , you get the Peace Corps , New York’s public schools . </s>
But after a while it deteriorates because they don’t change , they don’t improve , maybe once every 12 years they change a little . If we have universal health care , this is what we’ll get . Thank you , John Stossel . We have a Canadian in the house tonight , Michael Rachlis . A physician who— Maybe we have a lot of Canadians in the house tonight . </s>
Michael Rachlis is a physician who has lived on the other side of the US-Canada border , he trained in Canada , he practices medicine there . He is a health policy expert there . And given that Canada so often is the example cited as— for why universal coverage is the solution or why universal coverage is the problem , we are pleased to have Michael Rachlis standing at our podium to argue for the motion , “Universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility , ” Michael . Thank you very much , John . And I’d like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation and Intelligence Squared very much for inviting me to New York , I’ve had a wonderful time while I’ve been here . </s>
I also have a strong personal connection to the United States , my wife is an American and I visit her family on a regular basis and see the great health care that the United States has , and the terrible health care that this country has . And one is given to her father and one is given to her uncle , and the difference is insurance coverage . I’ve also slept overnight , I don’t want to give the impression I sleep around but , I’ve slept overnight in 23 US states and I have a pretty good idea of the health care system in this country as even my daughter has used it when she had a catfish spine through her palm in Florida . </s>
Now , as Paul has said , that this is very much a question of values . And it’s actually a case where you can have your cake and eat it too , in fact , you can only eat your cake if you have it , in other words , you can only get cost control if you—if you have equity . </s>
And as Paul has said , as we’ve heard others say , the US system costs the most in the world , it denies care to tens of millions of Americans and I have seen that personally . </s>
And the international performance and quality is just so-so . </s>
Does this really reflect American values . Is this really what you want out of your health care system . In Canada , our values for health care go back to Tommy Douglas , the premier of Saskatchewan between 1944 and 1961 . And when Tommy was a boy in my hometown of Winnipeg , Manitoba , he developed osteomyalitis , an infection in his leg . </s>
There were no antibiotics at the time , the recommendation of the doctors were that his leg should be amputated . </s>
Fortunately Dr. Robert Smith , a noted surgeon , saw Douglas , told him that because he was an interesting case , he would treat him for free if he allowed teaching students to -- allowed Dr. Smith to teach with him . Douglas was left with the impression all his life if he hadn’t been fortunate enough to run into Dr . Smith and be interesting , he would’ve lost his leg . Then a few years later , after Douglas’s government in Saskatchewan had implemented universal hospital insurance and universal medical insurance , despite the fact that in the 1940s being the poorest province in Canada , Justice Emmett Hall , a Supreme Court justice in Canada , and if anything a conservative , was asked by our then- Prime Minister , John George Diefenbaker , to review our health care system . </s>
His conclusion , was that we should move ahead with medical insurance ‘cause we already had hospital insurance . The main reason he gave was , efficiency . </s>
He said that it would be a lot cheaper to have a single-payer system , than to have multiple private payers . And so his vote was for efficiency . And those are the values on which our system are based . Equity and efficiency . </s>
What are the results ? </s>
Fifty years ago we had the same as your country . We had the same health status . We paid the same amount for health care . Fifty years later , all Canadians are covered for hospitals and physicians service . </s>
In the United States millions have no coverage , and tens of millions have , have inadequate insurance . We actually get more of most services than Americans do . We have more visits to doctors every year , more days in hospital , more days in nursing homes , we take more prescription drugs than you do . </s>
I mean , not all of these things are good , too much health care can kill you . But even though there are some services we don’t get as much of , like nobody in the world does as much cardiac interventions as you do , the Belgians are close , but nobody really else is close , we actually do more bone marrow transplants . We do more lung transplant surgery . Toronto is an international center for lung transplants . </s>
And that , far from lacking innovation , we’re the country that brought you insulin , we developed bone marrow transplantation . </s>
When Paul Tsongas was telling the electorate years ago that he would n't have got his service in Canada , it greatly offended the two people , two doctors in Toronto who had developed the procedure . And all of this costs way less , ten percent of our GDP compared to sixteen percent in your country . How does that happen ? Well , half of the extra expense is administration , because of the extra expense of this multiple payer system . </s>
The other half is due to higher prices because you don’t have effective cost control because you don’t have a single payer . Now , this must cost us a fortune , we must be basket cases . The Canadian Federal Government has run surpluses equal to one to two percent of our GDP for eleven years in a row . There’s no problem affording health care when you do it because you 're concerned about other people . Then you can make it affordable . </s>
And our health status , of course , is not a true reflection , but in other , but from what you’ll hear , perhaps , from these panelists and others , you’d imagine Canadians are dying in the street waiting for medical care . In fact , we now live three years longer on average than you do . This is over a fifty year period , we’ve now got a three year longer life expectancy . Our infant mortality rates are twenty to thirty percent lower than yours . And finally , it’s a great boon to business in our country . </s>
The province of Ontario has , the last couple of years , has been assembling more motor vehicles than any US state including Michigan . </s>
The costs to manufacturers are nine percent of payroll for health care costs in this country , one and a half percent in Canada . That our manufacturing center is under pressure , but it would be gone without our health care system . So , Canada has done well , but Canada is not the outlier . Canada is the outlier in North America . Around the world wealthy countries , all wealthy countries that Americans would think of when they think of other countries they could live in , with a comparable standard of living , all other countries have a mainly public system . </s>
And Canada does have problems in its system , just as every country has its problems . Our problems are second order problems . We’ve dealt with coverage , and we’ve mainly dealt with affordability . So we , we have waits and delays in Canada , they 're improving , but we do have them . But France and Germany have much shorter waits for care than you do in this country . </s>
So , despite the individual anecdotes that you 're going to hear , health care in Canada or Germany or France are remarkably similar to the US . A recent letter to the editor by Lou Holman from Rochester New York reported on his heart attack in Toronto while he was visiting , and he was having his surgery within one hour of calling the ambulance . So , let’s get serious . </s>
Health care is pretty standard in most developed countries , we have similar problems in delivery , you are the only ones that really have problems with coverage and affordability . </s>
So , it comes back to values . If you focus on equity , you get a bonus . </s>
You get cost control . If you focus on cost control , you don’t get equity or cost control . And I strongly encourage you folks to vote for our side . Thank you . </s>
Thank you Michael Rachlis . I am John Donvan , and this is Intelligence Squared US , Oxford-style debating . We have six panelists for and against the motion . </s>
The motion in this debate is , “Universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility.” </s>
We are halfway through the opening statements at this point , halfway to our Q & A section , but I’d now like to introduce , arguing against the motion , Sally Pipes , author of The Top Ten Myths of American Health Care : A Citizen’s Guide . She is president and chief executive officer of the Pacific Research Institute , a think tank based in California . </s>
She also comes from Canada , but not only does she argue against this motion , two years ago she completed a personal journey and became a citizen of the United States . Sally Pipes . And I 'm still Canadian , and proud of it . </s>
I am against the proposition that universal coverage should be the responsibility of the federal government . </s>
I do think that everyone here would agree that the key goal for America is affordable , accessible , quality health care . </s>
The question is , how do we achieve that goal ? </s>
There are two competing visions for health care reform in this country today , and also for achieving universal coverage . </s>
One focuses on government , mandates , and taxes , while the other focuses on free markets , innovation , and empowering consumers . Today that government vision is on the rise . The long term goal of most liberals is a Canadian-style , single payer , Medicare for all , health care system . </s>
These liberals tell us that socialized systems like those in Canada and Europe are better and cheaper and can provide universal coverage for all of us . They also site , as Michael did , life expectancy and infant mortality as evidence of the superiority of these systems . </s>
Well , let’s look at life expectancy . People who make this claim usually note that life expectancy is higher in Canada and Europe . </s>
The World Health Organization ranking does not measure , though , the quality of a health care system . The World Health Organization ranks systems that treat people equally higher than those that treat people well . Now let’s look at infant mortality . The US does have a higher infant mortality rate than Canada , hence their government system is rated better . The reality is that the United States , with its superior neo-natal care facilities , has allowed more high risk babies to live . </s>
But this also pushes the infant mortality rate higher because of a greater number of at risk births , babies being born . </s>
And in other countries many of those at risk babies do not live and are not counted in infant mortality statistics . Earlier this year , a woman in Calgary was expecting quadruplets , there wasn’t a single neo-natal unit for that woman to deliver her babies . </s>
She was airlifted to Great Falls , Montana , a city of fifty-five thousand , where she successfully delivered her quads . I 'm from Vancouver , Canada , I was home three years ago visiting my mom , and the front page story in the Vancouver Sun was , “Pregnant Mother with Twins Airlifted to Edmonton , Alberta.” When they came back , the husband , in the interview , on the front page of the Sun said , the Canadian Health Care System is that of a third world country . </s>
Now let’s look at adult cancer survival rates . A study published in the August , August issue of the British Journal Lancet Oncology said that America is much better at treating cancer than Europe or Canada . Researchers found that Americans have a better survival rate for thirteen of the sixteen most prominent cancers . For example , breast cancer survival rate among American women is eighty-three point five percent , whereas in Britain , seventy percent . </s>
American men and women are thirty- five percent more likely to survive colon cancer than their British counterparts . Now , I have discussed the data , but let’s look at the reality of universal coverage systems in Canada and Europe . Michael Moore , in his movie Sicko , where I have a cameo appearance , points to the wonderful health care systems in Canada , France , England , and Cuba , and he says they 're all free . The US does spend , as has been pointed out , sixteen percent of its gross domestic product on health care , while Canada spends on the range of ten to eleven percent . </s>
The reason that Canada spends ten to eleven percent is because the government sets a global budget and says , that’s what we’re spending . And what is the result ? Long waiting lists for care , rationed care , and a lack of access to the latest technological equipment . Today in Canada there are eight hundred and twenty-seven thousand Canadians waiting on a waiting list for procedures . </s>
There are three point two million , or ten percent of our population , waiting to get a primary care doctor . The average wait in 2007 from seeing a primary car doctor to getting treatment by a specialist was eighteen point three weeks . That’s over four months . Canada ranks thirteenth out of twenty-four OECD countries in MRI’s , and eighteenth out of twenty-four in CT scans . When I turned fifty , I know it’s hard to believe that I turned fifty , but I did , my doctor in San Francisco said , you have to have a colonoscopy . </s>
And I said , well , there’s nothing wrong with me , I don’t need a colonoscopy . Well anyway , I had one . But my mother in Vancouver , Canada , three years ago , July , started feeling ill and was convinced she had colon cancer . But her doctor kept saying , you 're old , there’s nothing wrong with you , go to bed , sleep more . </s>
Finally in December my mom started hemorrhaging from her colon . </s>
Her doctor said , you have to go to the hospital in an ambulance to get service in the emergency room -- I could not take her . After being in the emergency room for a number of hours she was then transferred to the transit lounge where she waited for two days to get a bed in a room . But she was not counted as waiting in an emergency room because she was in a transit lounge . The issue is that she was too old , it was decided by the health care system , to have a colonoscopy , when she was convinced that she was ill . </s>
And what about people with government coverage wait and wait in socialized systems , except the politicians . Belinda Stronach , former Canadian MP , opposed any privatization of Canadian health care . And yet , when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in June of 2007 , on the advice of her doctor , she flew to UCLA and had her breast surgery and paid for it herself . As my friend in Vancouver , Dr. Brian Day , orthopedic surgeon , and head of the CMA , Canadian Medical Association , told the New York Times , Canada is a country in which your dog can get a hip replacement in under a week , and in which humans wait two to three years . Is this the kind of government run health care system Americans desire ? </s>
Think about the post office . Think about the DMV and the handling of Katrina . A majority of Americans rate the quality of our , our system as excellent , or good . In Canada , according to Decima , only thirty-three percent rate the system as a grade A or B , and twenty-two percent say it’s failing . Canadians intuitively know that long waits are the outcomes of government run systems . </s>
While we can no longer deny there are problems in health care , markets , consumer choice , and innovation will solve them , rather than putting the government in charge . Thank you , Sally Pipes . You owe me eight seconds . Striding to the lectern now is Art Kellermann , who is a surgeon at the ER at Grady Memorial Hospital , Atlanta’s public hospital . </s>
He’s also professor of emergency medicine at Emory . And given that , as we know , so often the solution that the uninsured come to when they need medical care is to go to an emergency room , and it’s extremely valuable to us to have on the panel somebody who is at the receiving end of that process . </s>
I give you Art Kellermann . </s>
Thank you . Actually , I 'm not a surgeon , I am just an ER doc , and I don’t have the distinguished background of my fellow panelists , but I have treated thousands of patients , insured and uninsured , and I’ve also broken bad news to hundreds of families . I want to tell you about one of them that I’ll never forget . It took them two hours to reach Atlanta from the north Georgia mountains . </s>
I faced them across the outstretched body of their son . The ventilator hissed rhythmically , ten breaths per minute . I spoke first . </s>
Your son was in a terrible crash , I said . The ambulance crew could tell he was severely injured and called a helicopter . He reached us about three hours ago . He has several injuries , a collapsed lung , internal bleeding , but these are n't his most serious problem . </s>
His brain injury worries us the most . That’s when his mother interrupted me . </s>
She said , doctor , I do n't know how to ask you this , but I must . </s>
My husband lost his job six weeks ago , I work , but my employer does n't offer health insurance . </s>
Is my son going to get the care he needs ? </s>
Momentarily taken aback , I replied , ma'am , you 're at Grady Hospital , one of the finest trauma centers in the south , I swear to you , we will do everything in our power to save your son . I meant what I said that night , but I did n't tell her the whole truth . I did n't tell her that our best probably would n't be good enough , and that if her son survived he’d probably be disabled for the rest of his life . I did n't tell her that she and her husband would be billed for the helicopter flight , and the days or weeks to come in the intensive care unit , and that the total would probably reach a hundred thousand dollars , maybe a whole lot more . </s>
I did n't tell her that she and her husband would empty their savings and mortgage their home in an effort to pay the bill , and that it would n't be enough . And that the coins put in a coffee can at the local diner would n't come close to covering the difference . </s>
I did n't tell her that the unpaid balance of her son’s bill will push Grady hospital closer to insolvency , closer to its own crash , and if Grady closes , north Georgia , a region of more than five million people , will lose its only level one trauma center , its only burn unit , its only poison control center , its only emergency psychiatric unit , and seven hundred and fifty inpatient beds . And that’s not all . If Grady closes , metro Atlanta’s private hospitals , already overburdened by population growth , will topple like dominos one after another . </s>
Ladies and gentleman , for me this debate is not an idle intellectual exercise , it’s about lives . </s>
Three hundred million American lives . I support this resolution for three reasons . First , because our failure to cover every American is a national disgrace . Second , because we’ll never achieve universal coverage if we don’t make health care in this country more affordable . </s>
And third , because the only way we can make health care more affordable and cover everyone is through a well-regulated health care marketplace , and to do that the Federal Government must be involved . Now let me be clear , the majority of Americans do not want a government-only health care system , but they absolutely want the government involved , as a referee , as a cop , to make sure that everybody plays by the rules . The other side of this debate will try to convince you that rising health care costs are due to government interference . Well , they’ve got it backwards . </s>
The problem is not government interference with the health care industry , the problem today is health care industry interference with government . That’s why the business of medicine is booming . Record profits , huge executive salaries , bonuses , health care costs spiraling out of control year after year after year . But the caring side of medicine is failing . </s>
On the front lines , doctors , nurses , and other health care professionals are nearly as frustrated as you are . The nation-wide crisis in emergency care is a case in point . Every major challenge we face , ER’s packed with patients , dangerously long waits to be seen , a half million ambulances a year turned away to more distant hospitals , and fewer specialists than ever willing to take ER call . All of them are due to the fact that the economics of health care encourage hospitals to favor elective cases over emergency cases . Good for business , bad for patients . </s>
And it’s terribly expensive . </s>
Country music star Dolly Parton once quipped , you have no idea how much it costs to look this cheap . The same can be said about American health care . You have no idea how much it costs to run this poorly . We spend two trillion dollars a year on health care , and a trillion dollars is a lot of money . </s>
Put this in perspective , a million seconds ago was last week . A billion seconds ago Jimmy Carter was inaugurated president . A trillion seconds ago was thirty thousand BC . </s>
For two trillion dollars we can take good care of everybody in this country and have a lot left over , and you don’t have to look outside the US for proof . If everybody practiced medicine as efficiently as they do in Rochester , Minnesota and Salt Lake City , Utah , Medicare could pay thirty percent less to doctors and hospitals , and everybody would get better care . But it wo n't happen on its own , because one person’s waste is another person’s revenue stream . </s>
That 's why we need a cop on the beat , and the only cop with the clout to get the health care industry to play by the rules is the federal government . My side has given you several reasons to vote for tonight’s resolution , but the most compelling one of all is your own self interest , because a health care system that does n't work for everyone may not work for you when the chips are down . Take it from me , an ER doc , no one can predict when a life threatening emergency may strike , but if it does , you’ll want your hospital to go the extra mile , not your ambulance . Thank you . </s>
Thank you Art Kellermann . Our final speaker , speaking against the motion , is Michael Cannon . He is the director of health policy studies at the Cato Institute , which is the nation’s leading think tank , formed around the philosophy of libertarianism , which can very crudely and primitively , simplistically be summed up as “live and let live.” </s>
But I suppose the question is , do you need insurance to follow through on that ? Michael is arguing against , broadly and firmly against the notion of universal health coverage being the responsibility of the federal government . Michael ? Thank you . </s>
We do have a moral obligation to care for those who are in need of medical care , but that’s not where the disagreement lies tonight . Where we disagree is over whether universal coverage is going to help us fulfill that moral obligation , or as I will argue , make that moral obligation harder to fulfill . So , you’ve heard a lot of things about how wonderful universal coverage will be . You’ve heard that it will probably be all things to all men and women . They’ll make us taller and thinner and it’ll save us money . </s>
So let’s look at a couple of the actual likely effects of adopting universal coverage here in the United States . First off , it’s not going to save us money . Yes , other countries do universal coverage , and they do it on the cheap , or they do it for less money than we do , but there’s absolutely no way that can happen in the United States , and here’s why . Expanding insurance coverage means more people are going to go to the doctor , more people are going to use medical services . </s>
That costs more money . The urban institute estimates that it would cost at least a hundred and twenty billion dollars . That’s at least , it’s going to cost a lot more than that . Now , with the government in control , it’s tempting to think that we would be able to ratchet that spending down over time so that we’re more in line with other , other nations . But with the government in control of the , whatever universal coverage scheme you can dream up , the industry is going to prevent the government from doing just that . </s>
Art Kellermann is right , the industry does have too much influence over government spending in the Medicare program . And they use that influence to prevent the government from reducing , from reducing spending , from eliminating inefficient spending , wasteful spending . </s>
They’ve done it for Medicare’s entire history . So although it’s tempting to think that we could do health , we could do universal coverage , and we could have , and we could save money on it in the process , we would have an easier time moving the uninsured to Switzerland than we would have moving Switzerland’s spending levels here to the United States . </s>
Now , you’ve also heard that universal coverage would improve the quality of care . </s>
We actually have some pretty systemic problems when it comes to quality here in the United States . I 'm not a big proponent of the US health care sector . </s>
The experts tell us that if you have , the uninsured only get recommended -- what the evidence says , is the best recommended care about half of the time . But you know what , quality problems are so systemic that people in Medicare , in Medicaid , and people in the United Kingdom’s national health service , which is their universal coverage system , also only get quality , what the evidence says is best care about half of the time . </s>
Government , and then the reason is that government does n't pay for quality , and it’s been lagging in the private sector in coming up with quality improving innovations . Now in the private sector we have the same quality problem , but I’ll have more to say about that in a moment . One big quality problem is that we have alarming rates of medical error here in the United States . </s>
Universal Coverage is not going to help to prevent these medical errors . It’s not going to help nurses read doctors’ chicken scratchings and avoid the errors associated with those . It’s not going to encourage physicians and other clinicians to wash their hands between patients so they 're not passing on infections . Nor is it going to prevent errors by encouraging doctors to follow standardized protocols when inserting a central line . </s>
The same institute of medicine , I 'm surprised this statistics hasn’t come up today , but I’ll bring it up , the Institution of Medicine , the commission where Dr. Kellermann served , estimated that eighteen thousand Americans die every year from lack of health insurance . I believe that . That seems plausible to me . </s>
The same Institute of Medicine , however , estimated that up to a hundred thousand Americans die every year due to medical errors in hospitals . All universal coverage is going to do is bring more people into that system , broken system , it’s not going to do anything to fix that system . And yes , we might save the one , this one life over here , from this person who did n't have health insurance . </s>
We’d be ignoring these five deaths over here . Another quality problem that we have in the United States is we have alarming disparities in health outcomes . We have disparities between different racial groups of fifteen to twenty years in terms of life expectancy . And some Americans face mortality risks similar to what you see in Russia and sub-Saharan Africa . Universal coverage is not going to do anything to solve that problem . </s>
Sherry Glied , who’s the head of the Mailman School of Public Health at Columbia University wrote recently , quote , socio-economic differentials in health are large and growing , and appear to be growing , uh , in countries that have universal coverage as well as those that do not . </s>
End quote . Now , it’s true , universal coverage may save some lives . It may save this one life over here . So that seems to be something in its favor . </s>
But actually here the news is n't even all that good , because health economists tell us that if you have a dollar to spend on improving health , there’s absolutely no evidence that spending that dollar on universal coverage is going to get your more of an improvement in health than spending that dollar on any number of other things , including clinics , reducing medical errors , improving nutrition , fighting poverty , or even improving education . So , ironically , to vote for universal coverage does not show how much , how much you care about your neighbor’s health , it actually shows how little you care about your neighbor’s health , because you 're willing to forgot he added health benefits that might come from some of the , from spending that dollar on some of those other strategies . Now there is something very wrong with America’s health care sector , something that universal coverage will not solve . You can see what’s wrong , you can see what it is , I think , when you look at the Veteran’s Health Administration . </s>
Now I ca n't remember if this has come up already , if Professor Krugman mentioned the Veteran’s Health Administration . But this is hailed by people who support universal coverage as how , as exhibiting the superiority of government when dealing with the problems presented by health care . I think that the VA story is very important , but I don’t think it tells the story that supporters of universal , of universal coverage think that it tells . The VA has made impressive strides , using electronic medical records , to focus on preventive care , improving quality , avoiding medical errors . The reason is not some inherent superiority of government , the reason is really just two features of the way the VA is organized . </s>
They 're called integration and pre-payment . If anyone cares we can talk about what those mean later on . But those features are not unique to the Veteran’s Health Administration . They exist in private health plans all over the country , you know them as plans like Group Health Cooperative , Kaiser Permanente , and those plans are using health information technologies to reduce costs , improve quality , and reduce errors . </s>
Now why don’t you have electronic medical , electronic medical records , like you have electronic financial records ? Why does n't the hospital remember your medical history , your child’s medical history , your allergies , and these sorts of things ? </s>
Well , the biggest reason is America’s pursuit of universal coverage . Medicare is America’s great experiment with universal coverage , and it’s also the largest purchaser of medical care in the nation . And Medicare actually penalizes doctors and hospitals if they use electronic medical records to reduce costs , or to avoid medical errors . Electronic records help avoid duplication , but Medicare pays for duplication . </s>
So , if you adopt those , you make less money . </s>
Health information technologies avoid , help to avoid medical errors , but Medicare pays for medical errors . So , if you adopt those health information technologies , you lose money . So , providers make less money if they do these things that are in patient’s interests . </s>
Meanwhile , supporters of universal coverage are trying to keep those private health plans that use these things from participating in Medicare . With does n't Medicare stop paying for duplication and errors ? Because government resists change . So , I don’t think the VA success , the VA success has demonstrated government’s brilliance so much as how government actually impedes the support of quality affordable health care . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Michael Cannon . Well , you’ve now heard all of the opening statements , and we’re at the point of being able to share with you the poll results we took among you , the audience , when you first arrived . And they’ll come up on the screen behind me . </s>
Before the debate began forty-nine percent of you were for the motion , twenty-four percent against , twenty-seven percent undecided , which you know means that if you three leave right now , you’ve won . </s>
Yeah… I think we’re past that point . John Stossel , Art Kellermann suggested that there’s a conflict between keeping people healthy and making money keeping people healthy . </s>
What about that ? There are conflicts always in making a profit and delivering service to your customers . And you get rich if you service your customers well . The hospital that keeps people healthiest gets a reputation for doing a good job , and that’s how capitalism works , you get rich by doing well . But I heard you also argue that you feel there would be much less innovation in the US system if we went , if there were not a profit motive behind development . </s>
Totally . We take the benefits of the profit motive for granted all the time . The fact that I can go to a foreign country , stick a piece of plastic in the wall , and cash will come out . </s>
And I can give that card to a total stranger who does n't even speak English , and he’ll rent me a car for the week . And when I get home Visa or MasterCard will have the accounting correct to he penny . </s>
But the government ca n't even count the votes accurately . And yet our instinct… …is to go to government . Art Kellermann ? </s>
We had a lot of talking about cars earlier , and , I think everybody is familiar with the economic problems that GM is having right now , and actually I think GM’s cars are better than Trabant . But they 're carrying about five billion dollars a year in health care costs . Several years ago the CEO at GM testified before Congress and said two billion dollars out of their bottom line every year was just for drugs . Now meanwhile , Pfizer , the second largest pharmaceutical company in the United States , last year reported nineteen billion dollars in profit , thirty-seven percent profit margin . Now , I’m a big believer in market economics too but I don’t want our auto industry to wind up in Ontario , I’d like to keep a lot of it in Michigan . </s>
So I don’t understand , I mean I do think profit is good but I think when one industry can basically drive another one into the ground and harm our country , regulation is outta whack , and let me just—one other point . The FDA can not take the cost of a drug into consideration when it approves a new drug , it just has to be better than nothing . </s>
That’s not by accident . Congress prohibits the FDA from considering cost-effectiveness of new drugs . </s>
That’s not the case in the UK , it’s not the case in other countries , it should not be the case here— Paul Krugman , I’ll come to you in just a moment , Michael Cannon , against the proposition— —reason you raised , you raised earlier , Art , is that the industry has way too much influence when the government gets involved , and it’s nice to think that we could have this wonderful universal coverage plan and we could just get the industry out of it , we could just not have the industry be a part of it , we could…cut off their influence . But we know that the industry’s always going to be around , we know that there’ll always be drug companies and greedy private health insurance companies . </s>
And Republicans who will mess things up like they messed up FEMA and they mess up everything else . So you can’t say that universal coverage is this wonderful idea and we can separate out this part -- this is an inherent part . </s>
Unless you’ve— all the rent- seeking from the industry , and all the buffoonery from the Republicans , unless you have a plan to abolish Republicans they’re part of your plan . Paul Krugman— </s>
That , that— Paul Krugman for the motion— Maybe we can put them in camps . </s>
That came— Death camps . </s>
Paul Krugman for the motion , please— I meant happy camps— That came wonderfully into exactly what I was going to say , we have had Katrina used as an example and I thought to myself as I always do it must be wonderful to be a conservative because , you can take control of the government , make a mess of things and say see , that proves my point , isn’t that wonderful . And I would also add— You can , you can be— </s>
—since John Stossel— Since John Stossel has used vote-counting , you know , it’s not that the government’s , this particular government isn’t able to count the votes , it was sort of that they didn’t want to ? Michael—Michael Cannon . </s>
But do you—what’s your plan to deal with Republicans , do you want to abolish them or are they part of your plan . Medicare has its problems , but has continued to function . We have a well-established system , it continues—Social Security , is a system that’s working with high efficiency . </s>
The point is to get this thing— It is . If you have—pay any attention it works fine . And if you— If you pay any attention to Medicare you have to know that one- third of the money spent is wasted , that it rewards doctors— And private insurance— </s>
—for medical errors— </s>
And private insurance ? </s>
That’s the thing , I— Actually , can I just —I wanted to ask a question . And— </s>
Please—please do— —and I wanted to ask , actually two questions , to the audience . </s>
First , how many Canadians , would Canadians in the room please raise your hands . We have about seven hands going up— Okay , not as many as I thought . </s>
Okay , of those of you who are not on the panel who are Canadians , how many of you think you have a terrible health care system . </s>
One , two— We see—almost all of the same hands going up . </s>
Bad move on my part . I’ve got a selected -- all right , I won’t try it . </s>
But I will say , that— We should check their papers . </s>
Well , we’ve got—no , that’s… Sally Pipes— — got ta be honest , and— Let’s bring Sally Pipes into the conversation , she is against the motion . I just wanted to talk a little bit about Medicare , remember when , in 1965 when Medicare and Medicaid came in , and the cost was about $ 3 billion , and it was projected to cost $ 12 billion in 1990 . </s>
Well in fact it cost $ 107 billion , last year it cost $ 427 billion , it’s estimated in 2017 to cost $ 884 billion , the Medicare trustees way the program will be broke in 2019 . There is no cost control in Medicare , it is completely out of control . I think we need to give vouchers to people on Medicare and put consumers and seniors back in charge of their health care . </s>
But the issue is , are—is everyone loving Medicare . The recent Congressional commission said , that one in three Medicare patients is having a very hard time getting a doctor , and I have talked to many seniors , who are having a hard time getting a doctor under Medicare . Because the reimbursement rates by the government for the 8000 procedures on the list are too low and docs say I’m not going to do it . Sally Pipes , hold on just a moment because I want to come back to you for another question , I want to at this point tell the audience that in a couple of minutes I will be coming to you for questions and there are microphones being held by ushers toward the rear . And if you raise your hand , they will find you and then I will find you so just wave in my direction to get my attention . </s>
Sally Pipes and Michael Rachlis , you’re both born , raised , trained in Canada , but hearing you , Michael , argue for the proposition , and Sally Pipes hearing you argue against it , I’m—are you from the same country ? </s>
It’s hard to tell . I— No , but seri—but what about— I— —what about the Canada that Sally describes— </s>
I think that , well , you’ve heard the other side say you can’t trust research . So , I guess that we just have to go on gut feeling and spin , is that right ? So that I— Did we say that— ? —I think that— </s>
No , we did not— Sally has— Can we check the record— </s>
Sally has mentioned some—well , disparaging the international research , in fact , one of the people in the audience is one of the key people doing international research , maybe she can speak for herself , as to whether or not it is useless , but I feel that— —I feel that the international research is valuable and it shows , that by and large , other countries are delivering the same level of care , the unfortunate thing that happened to your mother , Sally , I’m very sorry for that , could easily happen in the United States , it could happen in any other country . A family doctor , who doesn’t , you know , for a variety of reasons , take a particular complaint seriously , that stuff happens , the rate of medical error in all developed countries is about the same , although the studies have been done slightly differently , eight countries have done studies . </s>
In all countries , 5 to 10 percent of all deaths are preventable deaths that occur in hospital . </s>
So that—modern health care has some very serious problems and is—this country in fact is a leader in looking at quality in health care . Dr. Donald Berwick , the founder of the Institute for Health Care Improvement , is the person , the preeminent person in the world , on this issue . But— Sally— what about that though— —but Canada doesn’t have problems with coverage , and neither does Germany or France , and we don’t have problems with affordability . </s>
We have second-order problems because we haven’t dealt with the quality issues . Michael , let me give Sally a chance to respond— Well , I mean if you look at the Canadian health care system , you know , it’s not free , as Michael Moore , Canadians pay dearly for the system through their taxes . </s>
What tax increases would we have to have here in America , to provide another $ 120 billion— I think you could cut— —for universal coverage— </s>
You could cut taxes . Well , I don’t— That’s what the Congressional Budget Office said in 1994 , that adopting a single-payer system would save so much money on extra administration , and then— But—well— </s>
—you could cover everybody . Art Kellermann— Well , you , you ration— Sally— </s>
—you ration care in Canada , and people— wait , and my mother is not a single example , there are thousands of examples through—in the mainstream media from the Toronto Star to the Globe and Mail , it’s all there . People—a woman stood up on Parliament Hill when Paul Martin was Prime Minister , and she stood there with her health care , Canada Health card , and she said what good is this Canada Health card , when I don’t have access to the health care system . Art Kellermann . Our ER man . First of all I heard some real interesting comments made from the other side earlier and I just want to say , y’all can’t make stuff up ‘cause none of you are running for President . </s>
Mike and I are ineligible— Second thing . </s>
Sally , you mentioned about Medicare . </s>
You know , we’ve had a recent experiment with private health plan efficiency , private health plans have started administering Medicare . They’re getting paid an average of 12 percent more per enrollee , that’s nearly $ 1000 more per person than traditional Medicare administers the same program . </s>
This is going to add 8.5 billion to the cost of Medicare this year in 2008 , and since 2004 , those plans will have sucked an extra $ 33 billion out of Medicare trust fund , without improving the care to beneficiary , so , again , Michael , I think you’re right , we got a lotta people that have gotten their hands around the federal till , and have made federal government a cash cow . </s>
I think federal government needs to be a watchdog . Let’s bring the audience into it because— But—I want to agree with , I want to agree with Art . I want to agree with him about the— This is Michael Cannon . </s>
—about the , about how Medicare Advantage costs the taxpayers more . </s>
I want to agree that -- and I disagree with Sally that I don’t think that we do any better in terms of health outcomes here in the United States . But those things don’t get you where you think they do . The fact that private insurance companies are ripping off the taxpayers through Medicare is problematic , but the alternative is to let the doctors in the hospitals do that because they’re the ones who’ve been doing that for the first 40 years . </s>
I want to say one other thing— And—no , I’m not done yet . So , and the fact that we don’t lead the—I don’t think we lead the world in terms of health outcomes but that just means that we’re doing poorly , other nations are doing poorly , no one is innovating in order to make those improvements in medical errors , except , you know , we got the Kaisers and the Group Healths out there that are actually doing this , and you just made an argument against having them participate in Medicare , you’re trying to keep them—those innovations out of a government program . </s>
Art , hold your response to that to perhaps your summing up at the two minutes because we— Can I just add— </s>
—do want to go to the audience and -- gentlemen . If you’re a member of the media we ask you to identify yourself by name and organization , otherwise it’s your choice . </s>
Sir ? And remember , 30 seconds . Isn’t the dirty secret that we can not afford to have everyone have all the health care that they would possibly want , and so in America we ration it by price , and in other countries you ration it by lottery . </s>
Paul Krugman , let’s hear from you on that— Yeah , no , that’s definitely true . </s>
There is , although , it’s not clear that we’re really at the point where that’s the critical limitation , that’s—at this point , just eliminating health care that actually does no good at all would probably be enough to save a large amount , that’s what the Congressional Budget Office says , so it’s not a really a— in the very long run , what happens when we have the $ 30 million immortality treatment , that sort of thing , this becomes a big problem . </s>
Look , I just want to bring—one more thing , we’ve been talking a lot about quality of care but there’s one other thing that is very important which is the financial ruin that often comes from medical expenses . And that is preventable and that’s only in America , the individual who is finan—the family that’s financially ruined . Every time I look at one of the studies that says well we can’t show that providing health insurance makes that much difference in health outcomes . First of all I don’t quite believe it but secondly , there is a tremendous difference in terms of not the medical side but the economic side and this is something again , there’s a risk , a fear , a terror of medical expenses , which happens among wealthy countries only in America . I’m glad , Professor Krugman , that you’re letting some economics creep into your remarks tonight . </s>
I want to point out though that the AARP recently released a study that showed that bankruptcy rates are rising fastest , among those people who are covered by our only universal coverage program . Not only are they rising faster among that group than for other groups but for other groups , those bankruptcy rates are falling , how is that consistent with what you said about universal coverage protecting us from financial ruin— But that’s the— No , I’m not talking about bankruptcy rates , I’m talking about all kinds of people— Well , what— </s>
And you know , those are— —give me another measure of financial ruin— —the elderly , right ? The elderly— Give me another measure of financial ruin . </s>
No , come on , there are— All right , let’s go back to the audience , in the middle , you want to identify yourself . </s>
BETSY McCAUGHEY Yes , I’m Betsy McCaughey from the Hudson Institute . </s>
I’m worried about seniors and what the impact will be of a Medicare- for-all system on them . In countries with Medicare for all seniors are denied treatments that seniors in the US can get , the thinking is that the public health dollars are better spent on young people because the benefits will be more lasting . </s>
For example two years ago the British National Health Service decreed , that seniors with wet macular degeneration could not get the drug Lucentis until they had already gone blind in one eye , then they could get it to save the other eye . Why should seniors in the United States take that risk and support a Medicare-for-all system . Sally Pipes ? Exactly . </s>
Well the thing is that in Great—in Britain there are other examples , Tarceva , the drug for lung cancer that is available here . </s>
It—you know , if the NIHCE , the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence , a government bureaucracy says , Tarceva is not cost-effective and therefore you’re too old to have it , you’re denied it . You can go out and pay for it in the market , but all of your services provided then under the National Health Service , are no longer available to you . Is this what we want , this is what we’re talking about in Congress right now with the CER , the Comparative Effectiveness Research . </s>
We want to do this in the United States , this is going to destroy the innovation that John Stossel was talking about , and it’s going to destroy our ability to live longer and healthier lives , it’s not what the American people want . </s>
Sally Pipes is against the motion . Gentleman , on the right . There are a lot of personal stories being told tonight . And I’m glad to say that I have health insurance . </s>
And the idea of increased wait times for a medical procedure , that terrifies me . But then I think about the 15 percent of America who have no insurance . </s>
And how long are their wait times . </s>
So basically like what I can’t wrap my brain around is , how can a system based on companies , that make a profit on denying our care be made responsible for paying for our care . John Stossel . Well , you’re right , the insurance companies have a conflict , and , the insurance company has to balance , they want to pay for nothing , they hope none of you ever get sick and if you get sick they don’t want to pay . But , of course if they do that , word gets out , and they don’t get any new customers , so that’s how they have to balance that . </s>
You know— That’s how all businesses balance that , and— </s>
Or , or they wouldn’t if you were able to choose your insurance company… That’s the other problem , that you have to buy insurance here in New York , from a New York insurance company , and because the politicians always wanting to give you more have loaded it up with all these extra guarantees , they—you must pay for Viagra and in-vitro fertilization and acupuncture or hypnosis or pastoral counseling , I forget what’s all on the list that’s mandated— Oh , okay , can I just—this is— </s>
You’re not allowed to buy from Wisconsin where insurance costs a fourth as much . The reason you have to buy from a New York insurance company is because New York has community rating , which means that an insurance company can not turn you down if you have a preexisting condition . </s>
And if they throw it open , across the country , then , people who don’t have a preexisting condition , people who are healthy can go shopping , and it’s not some kind of crazy thing because they want people to have hypnosis . Actually— It’s because they’re trying to protect people who would not otherwise be able to get insurance , and that gets at the irresponsibility of the arguments that are made so often— Thank you , Paul Krugman— </s>
—in this case— —Art Kellermann . There’ve been so many points out here that I wish we could address , one I want to talk about is waiting times , because you hear that all the time . The waiting times that matter , are the waiting times for things like , when you go to the ER and how quickly you see a doctor for a heart attack . How quickly you get stroke care . </s>
Whether or not if you’ve got acute or worrisome symptoms you can see your doctor that day or the next day or you end up having to be in an ER . We’re turning away one ambulance per minute in this country from overcrowded private as well as public hospitals in the United States . </s>
If you’ve got to limp around for two months on a bum knee until you get a new titanium knee , I’m sorry . That’s not going to kill you . You don’t get to me for 30 or 45 minutes because you’ve been diverted from three hospitals , you’re going to die . That’s the waiting times that we need to worry about in the United States and it’s not going to happen if we ignore this problem . </s>
Michael Cannon , against the motion . </s>
Professor Krugman mentioned that community rating laws like you have here in New York are intended to help the sick obtain health insurance . The leading researcher in the country on insurance markets , specifically the individual market where you buy insurance directly is a man named Mark Paul , he’s at the University of Pennsylvania . And what he’s found after researching , what actually happens in insurance markets , is he’s found that those laws reduce—the community rating laws that Professor Krugman favors -- reduce the number of people with health insurance , and they don’t provide health insurance to many more sick people , and the reason is that unregulated markets really do a remarkably good job of providing health insurance to people with expensive chronic conditions , provided they purchase health insurance while they’re still healthy . </s>
So these regulations— Yeah . </s>
If they— And—yeah . </s>
And it’s expensive and difficult to do , but you can not have an insurance market unless people do that , because no one’ll buy insurance until they need it . No— you can’t have a fire—a homeowner’s insurance market if people can buy coverage after their house burns down . That is the market’s way of encouraging people to do the right thing and pay into the pool while they’re still healthy . </s>
— </s>
Ma’am , right—a question from the audience , ma’am ? </s>
Yes , I have a question about America’s competitiveness , and how it’s influenced by these issues . Art Kellermann mentioned GM , …I was also thinking about another engine of growth which is entrepreneurs , in America , most new jobs are generated by entrepreneurs , not by big companies . And usually , entrepreneurs can not offer health care because the rates are so prohibitive . </s>
So this in fact decreases our competitiveness . And this is just one issue along with the big companies , I mean , globalization’s not going to go away . I think it would be a relief to many sectors if health care wasn’t a drag on their profits— So your question is— </s>
I’m looking at big business and how it affects globalization— But you would like to know— </s>
—but also— But you would kind of like to know what— Okay , I would like to know the pan—the , the two pan—the six panelists’ , views on , how can we possibly keep going forward the way we are if we’re status quo , when we’re going to have huge competition from India , China , and other places— Yeah— </s>
—that can— Well , I— —out-compete us— </s>
—John , I think that’s right up your alley , that question . We already have huge competition from China and India and Europe , these countries with universal care . And by and large we’re cleaning their clocks . America’s created 20 million new jobs while Europe created two . So—two million , so , yes , GM has to pay more for health care than steel , and that’s awful , but in these other countries , they have to pay huge amounts in taxes , and that’s even more crippling . </s>
Point of fact , I think the United States created 23 million jobs when some other guy was President…and actually employment growth in Europe has been faster since 2000 than the United States , so , that’s a little bit out of date . And I would like to add that— Michael Rachlis— </s>
I— —for the motion— </s>
I think you’re cherry-picking times , you picked the 20 years…the United States has created— I don’t know what— </s>
—10 times as many jobs— —that 20-year period—that 20 million figure refers to , I think that was a number just sort of plucked out of air . Okay , let’s stop there— I— —getting off the topic , Michael Rachlis— </s>
Yeah , that in all this talk about health care with traditional economic models , that really , that is one of the main reasons why you folks have not been able to make progress . </s>
That is , using traditional marketplace models , focused on that as your ideology to analyze health care , which is not in any way close to being a traditional economic market . And to apply some sort of economic… language the way we’re hearing from the other side , to a system which is—where the supply side is massively regulated , for good reasons . You know , do you want to be able to—going to have to look up every single provider that you see to find out whether or not they passed their licensing exams or not ? You know , I—the extension would—of this argument would be Milton Friedman’s one that , just absolutely no regulation whatsoever . </s>
But , that— Fine with me— —that doesn’t deal with health care where it by and large for key decisions , consumers can never be at the same information level as the agent who’s recommending those services— </s>
Sally Pipes , you look like you’re dying to say something . </s>
I’m just dying to say that , we got—a lot of the mess that we’re in in this country including part of the 46 million is because , federal government gave employers a tax advantage to provide health insurance . And as a result , people in America , 60 percent of people in America get their health insurance through their employer . </s>
If you lose your job or you quit your job , we don’t have portable health insurance . If we make a few simple tax changes , such as refundable tax credits or an income tax deduction , we really need to focus on growing the individual market , so that people can buy insurance across state lines , people can get the type of insurance that fits their needs , we can grow the individual insurance market because competition will work . And when we have 1900 mandates on insurance across this country , it’s impossible for an insurer to provide a stripped-down policy which…two-thirds of the uninsured are in that 18-to-30 age bracket , and they don’t want to buy insurance with , as John said , in-vitro fertilization , alcohol rehabilitation . </s>
We can open up this market , and cover a lot of those people because of the 46 million uninsured , 17 million earn over $ 50,000 a year , and 10 million earn over 75,000 , a lot are younger , they’re healthy , and they don’t want to pay $ 4,000 a year for insurance to cover things that they don’t need to care for— Thank you , Sally Pipes , question down front , please— </s>
Most—many of those folks have illnesses , and they can not get insurance no matter how much money they pay— But if we open up the market , new competitors would come into the market— No , but— </s>
—and some would— This— —and they would be based on— Health— —on condition— </s>
—health care is not a market like other markets— Well , it’s not a right— —but it’s got ta be closer— </s>
—it’s not a right— —to being a market like other markets— Time out , too many people talking at once is not making sense . </s>
Michael , go ahead , Michael Cannon speaking against the motion . Health care presents a lot of interesting challenges , and the question is not , oh , well , it’s special so therefore markets can’t do it . The question is , well , you know , markets and governments have advantages and disadvantages and , which one works best , which set of tools works best for this particular problem . I’ve always enjoyed hearing from proponents of universal coverage that the US has this market-driven , for-profit health care sector , you know , the government controls half of the money in our health care sector . </s>
And because of government tax policy , employers control another quarter of it . So , 75 percent of the money is controlled by someone other than the consumer , how in any way , is that a free market . </s>
I’m reminded of a favorite expression , expression of my brother’s , he likes to say , you know , you’re pissing on my shoes and telling me that it’s raining . </s>
What’s driving these costs and what’s driving these quality problems are those 75 percent . So—well , I’ll stop there . Thank you , question down front— I have a quick question for Dr. Kellermann , you mentioned the Mayo Clinic as a model of efficiency and I think we all recognize it as a model of great health care , what’s the impediment right now to having more Mayo Clinics in this country , why don’t we have them if the market can provide that , and I don’t know that we could look anywhere— People come all over the world to Mayo Clinic , why doesn’t universal health care coverage provide that in other places . The Mayo Clinic has a great philosophy . </s>
It’s very heavily focused on primary care , they’re very heavily focused on efficiency . You don’t have to be efficient to be successful in this country . I just have to talk you into getting all the tests that I want you to get , I need to talk you into getting the procedures you want . </s>
You know , we just talked about economics . Everybody these days is complaining about gas prices with good reason . But if we ran our oil industry the way we’re running our health care industry gasoline would cost $ 16 a gallon and one out of every six American cars couldn’t burn it . </s>
We can do better than that . Question from the back there ? My name is Tony Meyer and I care about this issue too , and in 2002 I founded a company that today is one of the largest managers of defined-contribution programs for corporate America , and we work with General Motors and Ford and Chrysler and many other great American industrial companies— This had better be a question , not a commercial— There is , there is , this is not an advertisement . </s>
My question , and Ms . Pipes , you just mentioned it , no one has talked about the fact that , we have a unique health care delivery system which is really managed by large employers , it’s unique in the world . Nobody’s talked about whether that’s a problem or a solution , should it be reformed , discarded , modified . </s>
I’d be curious what the panel thinks of that approach . Well , and I did mention , I think it does need to be changed because if your employer— </s>
Discarded . Yes . I mean if your employer is paying about $ 15,000 for your health coverage , that might not be the kind of health coverage that fits you as an individual , you may not want that type , but if we open up the market , and give individuals the same tax incentive— Because if you go out in the individual market and buy insurance , you don’t get a tax break on that , but if you get it in decreased wages but through your employer , it’s cheaper and you—and you’re able to get it because you’re part of that pool . So we need to , as John says , actually discard that model and move away from it . </s>
You know , we can’t move away from it overnight , but we can make some changes in the tax code , that will allow the individual market to grow , and we need— we don’t get our life insurance , we don’t get our long-term care insurance , our home insurance from our employer . As I said , this was a gift during World War II , and it was a terrible gift that has distorted in my mind a great deal of the health care system— </s>
Paul Krugman . Yeah , it’s not the system you would design if you were starting from scratch and it’s not the system we want to end up with . </s>
But it’s a system that at least did the basics of risk-pooling for a lot of people , it’s a system that did deal with the problems of preexisting conditions and people being screened and does somewhat reduce the problem of insurance companies , not to deliver care but to , who can do the best job of finding who really needs insurance so as not to give it to them . </s>
So it’s not—I have no brief with that system , but , the idea that what we need to do is scrap it and move to an individual insurance market which has never worked anywhere , it’s the most amazing thing , that what we have coming from the conservative side is the belief that , universal health care , which works all across the world , is undoable . And that an individual market , which has never worked anywhere , is the answer to our problems , extraordinary leap of faith . Are you familiar with Professor Pauly’s research on the individual market ? Yeah , I’ve seen some , but you know , we just , it— Well , you— </s>
—there just isn’t enough out there— —you’ve seen some , that’s where reality enters the discussion— Time is up for this section . Thank you very much to the audience for , actually , terrific questions . I want to remind you , just before we move to the summing-up section where each of the panelists will have two minutes , I want to remind you of how you voted when you came in if we can put the slide up again . </s>
Before the debate , 49 percent of you agreed with the proposition that universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility . 24 percent of you were against that motion and 27 percent were undecided . In the next 10 to 12 minutes you will hear a summing up and then we will vote one further time , and our first panelist to begin his two-minute summary , John Stossel . Oh—okay . If you think health care is expensive now , wait till you see how expensive it is when it’s free . </s>
When it’s free there are no controls . </s>
I don’t think this side is saying the American system is a good system , it’s not a market . We’re spending other people’s money , government is already involved spending about half the money , third parties pay for seven out of every eight dollars , this is an awful way to pay for things . Think how it would work for your car insurance worked that way , if they paid for your gas and your oil you wouldn’t care what gas costs and people would sell you $ 100 oil changes . That’s what’s going on in health care under insurance companies paying , or the government . </s>
And employment-based insurance makes no sense when four out of 10 Americans change jobs now every year . Government is not the answer , we don’t have government steel mills or government airlines anymore because they were awful , and once they had competition they went outta business . Michael says medicine’s different , but , every profession says that . The truth is it—it’s true , you don’t—you’re not an expert , you don’t know which doctor’s the best . </s>
But you don’t know which car’s the best , you’re not car engineers . But through word of mouth the good news spreads , the bad companies go out of business , the good doctors will take over , and we see this now , where there is a market , the tiny places , like cosmetic surgery , lasek eye surgery . The doctors give you their email addresses . </s>
Does your doctor do that ? </s>
They give out their cell phone numbers , the waiting rooms are nice . And the prices are going down , while the quality is going up . The post office can never give us what FedEx can . Thank you , John Stossel . John Stossel…John Stossel , speaking against the motion . </s>
Speaking for the motion in his summary , Paul Krugman . In the course of this debate I actually felt…I don’t know whether the audience will agree but I actually felt that John Stossel in effect conceded , when he held up that Trabant at the end of it . Because that just shows , if all you can do is say Communism , Communism , East Germany— I don’t want us to move to East Germany . I just want us to move to France . </s>
Now , the… Look…government health care isn’t perfect . Actually , government health care isn’t the issue , government insurance isn’t perfect , so is private insurance . There are horror stories , the nature of health care , is that lots of bad things happen . You don’t generally seek health care , because you’re feeling great . </s>
But we have extensive experience , we have Medicare , which is a system that is flawed but has actually shown slower cost inflation , than private health insurance over the past 40 years . </s>
We have the Veterans Health Administration which is our little island of true socialized medicine in the United States . And it does very well . </s>
And above all , what we have is a system right now , remembering what the proposition is , the motion is that the federal government should guarantee health care . </s>
Not that the government should run everything , not that everything should be under government control , not that we should nationalize the steel industry , which keeps on being run but as you know is not on the agenda or nationalize the auto company , but whether there should be a federal guarantee of health care for everybody . And that , I think , is something that American values , that our fundamental morality says is something we should be doing . Thank you , Paul Krugman . And making her two- minute summary against the motion , Sally Pipes . Although it would be nice if the federal government could solve all of our health care challenges , current events both at home and abroad show that it can not . </s>
As a Canadian , I watched first- hand the promise of free health care , and I saw it devolve into the reality of a high tax bill , and long lines for advanced care . As waiting lists grew over the years to more than four months in 2007 , an increasing number of Canadians have traveled to the United States for treatment and paid out of pocket , whether it’s Mayo , the Cleveland Clinic , or UCSF system . </s>
The number of illegal private clinics in Canada has grown significantly over the last few years . The government is afraid to shut them down even though private health care is illegal in Canada , for fear of an immense outcry . </s>
In June 2005 , the Canadian Supreme Court ruled , in a monumental decision , that the ban on private health care in Quebec is illegal . Quebecers are entitled to life , liberty , and the security of the person . Long waiting lists do not give you that security . </s>
Madame Chief Justice Beverley McLaughlin said , access to a waiting list is not access to health care . </s>
Claude Castonguay , chair of a Quebec Royal Commission on Health Care in the 1960’s recommended that Quebec adopt government health care . </s>
The Quebec government followed his advice , and they called him the father of Quebec Medicare , just like Tommy Douglas , the father of Medicare . This year he released a report , an official government report evaluating Quebec’s ailing health care system . His conclusion , it’s in crisis . </s>
He now urges legalization of private health insurance . Americans believe in freedom and personal responsibility , not big government . </s>
They don’t want big government controlling our lives . The question is , who do you want to control your health care decisions ? </s>
An HMO bureaucrat , a government bureaucrat , or you yourself ? </s>
By supporting universal choice in health care , and empowering consumers , we will achieve universal coverage . Thank you . </s>
Thank you Sally Pipes . I want to mention for the purposes of our radio broadcast that Sally Pipes is President and Chief Executive Officer of the Pacific Research Institute . Also you’ve heard from John Stossel , John Stossel an ABC News correspondent , co-anchor of 20/20 , and author of The John Stossel Specials . And we heard from Paul Krugman , an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times , and professor at Princeton and the London School of Economics . </s>
We’re next going to hear from Michael Rachlis , Michael Rachlis is a physician and health policy analyst , the author of Prescription for Excellence : How Innovation is Saving Canada’s Health Care System . </s>
Michael , your two minutes begin now . Yes , I want to mention that , that there is virtually no flow of Canadians south of the border . </s>
The Canadians getting health care south of the border are , like , ninety-nine percent of them are like my daughter who had a catfish spine through her palm— people on vacation . </s>
That there is the waiting list issue , I mentioned that it is a problem in Canada , but other countries with universal systems don’t have waiting list problems . It is not a problem of universal coverage . And in fact , in Toronto right now , because of public response to the concerns about waiting lists , if you need cataract surgery , if you need your knee replaced , if you need a hip replaced , phone one number , you can be seen in an assessment clinic within one week usually , and you can get your surgery within a month after that , and it does n't cost you any money directly , because you pay it in your taxes , and the taxes in Canada as a share of GDP are almost as low as they are in the United States . And we’ve had surpluses for eleven years . </s>
I think what you 're hearing from the other side are a whole series of anecdotes , and yet the overall research indicates that every other wealthy country in the world where you would feel comfortable visiting and living has a universal system . And I think what you really have to watch out for is what the New Yorker commented on April 20th , 1992 , referring to then the first president Bush : The compulsion that drives President Bush to distort the facts about Canadian Health Care suggests that official American policy is in the process of becoming what conservatives in discussing the Soviet Union used to call a total ideology , a system blindly convinced of its absolute truth , and yet so fragile in its relationship to reality that it is n't capable of considering even the most obvious reform . Surely we should have learned by now what happens to ideological systems that begin to deny facts that their people can discover for themselves just by crossing a border . Cross the border , come to Canada , anybody in the audience , contact me , I will show you the Canadian health care system , and then America should do universal coverage in its innovative fashion . </s>
Make health care a right , and then do it right . Michael Rachlis summing up for the proposition . </s>
Summing up against the proposition , Michael Cannon , co-author of Health Competition : What’s Holding Back Health Care and How to Free It . He is the Cato Institute’s director of health policy studies . Michael ? The perception before we came in here , I was standing across from a man who was reading his program , and when he came to the part with my picture on it , he looked at the picture , he looked up at me , and he said , hey , that 's you . And I said , yes , that 's me . </s>
And he said , you 're against universal coverage ! ? Because I think , and this look came over his face , the question that was forming was something like , what kind of a moral reprobate could be against universal health insurance coverage ? </s>
And I know that I have a lot of family here tonight who are asking themselves the same question . My opposition stems from two beliefs . </s>
One is that people should have the right to choose their doctor , they should have the right to choose their health plan , and those things are often lost in system of universal coverage , almost uniformly . No , I think totally lost . And second , universal coverage is not going to make us healthier . We have serious problems here in the United States with rising costs , with low quality care , and we have health plans in the private sector that are trying to innovate with ways to reduce those costs , and to improve the quality of care . </s>
The only problem is , you ca n't choose them , because the government has said you ca n't . </s>
The only problem is that the government controls half of the money in our health care sector , and so the industry has , is able to block those innovations , because they want to protect their incomes . </s>
You can have a health care sector that guarantees universal coverage , or you can have a health care sector that continuously makes medical care better , cheaper , and safer , making it easier to deliver on that moral obligation that we have to help the less fortunate among us . You can not have both . </s>
Thank you , Michael Cannon . Finally , the last word goes to Art Kellermann . Art Kellerman is not a surgeon , as I incorrectly said before , Art Kellermann is an ER doctor at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta , and a professor at Emory , summing up for the motion universal health coverage should be the federal government’s responsibility . Dr. Art Kellermann . Have you all heard the expression that there are no atheists in fox holes ? </s>
I can tell you , in my experience , there are no libertarians in intensive care units . It’s widely said that Americans can pick their doctor . </s>
The fact of the matter is , if you 're in a non-group plan , or you 're in a plan that does n't contract with these doctors over here , but you can over here , every day I see patients whose care is disrupted because their plan has shifted doctors , they did n't get the deal they wanted . </s>
We’ve surrendered an enormous amount of freedom in this country to the private insurance industry , and to the rest of the industry . We can collectively together do better . In just a few moments you 're going to vote again , and the six of us care a lot about how that vote turns out . But that’s really not the vote that matters . The vote that matters is coming up on November the 4th , and I encourage every one of you to do your homework , and do your homework on the candidate’s positions on health care , because they are strikingly different , and they , to some degree , break down along the lines of the debate tonight , and it should make a difference in the choice that you make then as well as the choice you make tonight . </s>
I want to close by going back to the bedside of that family . I did n't tell that mother the whole truth that night , but by staying silent and withholding the truth I left her with something we both needed , which is hope . Hope that her son would beat the odds . Sometimes we see young people come back from catastrophic injuries and do OK . </s>
Hope that Georgia and every other state in this country would develop efficient , effective regionalized trauma and emergency care systems so everyone can have access to life saving emergency care . And most important , hope that this great nation of ours , the United States of America , will soon finally do the right thing and cover the uninsured so no mother need ever ask again , will my son get the care he needs ? </s>
Please vote for tonight’s resolution . Well , we’re done , but for your part , but this was a really terrific debate , and I want to just , for all six , this is n't just Art’s applause now , but for all six… So pick up those voting keypads , you may recall that when you came in here forty-nine percent of you were for the motion that universal health coverage should be a federal responsibility , twenty-four percent of you were against , and twenty-seven percent of you were undecided . So , you can begin the voting process , which you seem to have gotten down the first time quite quickly . </s>
Number one you 're for the motion , number two you are against the motion , number three you remain undecided , or became undecided . Anyone need more time ? </s>
Everybody’s good ? OK , I want to thank you , before we go to the results , I just want to thank the panelists , and especially all of you in the audience , because the questions were first rate , and moved the discussion into interesting places . </s>
I want you to also know that our next debate will be Tuesday October 7th , 2008 . The motion is going to be “America is finally winning the war in Iraq.” Panelists for this motion will be Fred Kagan of AEI , he is widely seen as the architect of the surge ; and also retired Four Star General Jack Keane , for the motion . Against the motion is Charles Ferguson , the writer/director of the Iraq War documentary No End in Sight , and Sir Malcolm Rifkind , the former foreign secretary and defense secretary of the UK , and a current member of Parliament . </s>
These debates that you are taking part in as audience members can also be heard on more than a hundred fifty NPR stations across the country , please check your local NPR member station listings for the dates and times of the broadcast . Also , copies of books by the authors are on sale in the lobby in plentiful supply . Learn more about their ideas in depth . And I am quite serious about that . </s>
Finally , we are pleased to announce that our December 2nd debate , where the motion is : “Bush 43 is the worst president of the last 50 years…” will… Not voting now please . Will be recorded for broadcast on BBC World News television . To accommodate for that taping we will be moving the debate to a larger space , Symphony Space theater at 95th and Broadway . </s>
This means that there will be more seats available , a limited number of tickets will be made available . </s>
And now to the results , a question of who won the room . Before the debate , for : forty-nine percent ; against : twenty-four percent ; undecided : twenty-seven percent . After the debate… Fifty-eight percent are for the proposition , thirty-four percent against , eight percent undecided . </s>
Thank you very much everyone for joining us this evening . null Hi , my name is , uh , Bernie Weinraub and I’m the moderator of this , uh , panel . </s>
And , um , uh , first of all , I want to say something that I’ve wanted to say for many , many years , and that’s to , uh , please turn off your cell phones and beepers . And unwrap all cellophaned items , because , uh , there’s , there are , um , microphones all around here . </s>
And , um , this is going to be broadcast over , um , NPR . </s>
Um , so we have to sort of unwrap any kind of cellophaned items and candy and all that stuff . Um , and it would ruin the mood to hear cellophane . Um , uh , and I , I’ve been asked to have people come down forward , uh , but I guess you guys are okay . </s>
Um , I want you guys to , um , get your questions ready for the Q & A after the opening statements and not to be shy about asking the panel anything , anything that you want to ask . </s>
Um , if you want three by five cards to write your questions down , um , the ushers will hand them out . Um , now I’m pleased and happy to introduce the man responsible for this debate and all the other debates , Robert Rosenkranz , who will make some opening remarks . </s>
Well , good evening and thank you all for being here . I’m Robert Rosenkranz , Chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate Forum , which is an initiative of the Rosenkranz Foundation . I’m here with Donna Wolfe , our Executive Producer , who has , been with me from the creation of this series . </s>
This is the fourth debate of our , uh , fall season . </s>
There are going to be four more in , in the spring and probably an even expanded program next year . We’re thrilled that WNYC is , uh , recording this series of debates , producing them as radio programs , which through the good offices of NPR , are distributed nationally to a majority of the largest radio markets in the country . Um , we also value the sponsorship of The Times of London and I especially want to thank our moderator , Bernie Weinraub , who I will formally introduce momentarily , as well as the extraordinarily able group of panelists who are the true stars of tonight’s evening . Let me begin by saying what’s to , what tonight’s debate is not . It is not , Resolved : Movies Should Be Censored and Their Export Restricted . </s>
It is not , Resolved : George W. Bush Has Fueled Anti- Americanism Abroad . Rather , it’s about the connection of two pretty clearly indisputable facts . First , that the American entertainment industry , Hollywood , has been highly successful in creating a product with deep appeal for a global audience . </s>
Those , like myself , who have a commitment to free markets and free expression would be hard put not to say , Two cheers for Hollywood . But why not three cheers ? Well , because billions of people around the world get their primary impressions of American life and culture from our movies and television shows , which leads us to a second indisputable fact -- a rising tide of anti-American sentiment , particularly in Europe and the Middle East . It’s challenging for us as Americans to understand why the world so often views us differently from the way we view ourselves . With that in mind , the motion tonight is intended to explore what relationship exists , if any , between these two phenomenon . </s>
Content aside , is Hollywood’s dominance of global entertainment perceived as a hated form of cultural imperialism ? Does the content of Hollywood films and television , taken as a whole , reflect a distorted picture of American life ? And does this picture matter in terms of the rise of anti-American sentiment ? Well , let’s see what the evidence shows . I’d now like to introduce our moderator for the evening , Bernard Weinraub . </s>
Bernie became , began as a copy boy at The New York Times , served abroad for The Times in Saigon , London , New Delhi and Washington . In 1990 he moved to Los Angeles , where he’s been covering Hollywood for The New York Times until his retirement about a year ago . Uh , he recently wrote a play , The Accomplice , which will open in New York in March 2007 . </s>
So I’m happy to be able to plug that . And I’m very pleased now to , uh , hand the evening over to Bernie . Thank you . </s>
Thank you . The one , um , thing that I’ve been told that I forgot in the introduction is , um , because we’re going to be on , on NPR , um , we’ve got ta sort of , I guess , fake it a little bit and we have to a lou…a loud round of applause for NPR and for the radio broadcast . So , please , a round of applause . MAN All right , whoo . </s>
Great . </s>
Um , let me give you a brief rundown of the evening . First , the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument . The opposition will follow . Each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we’ll go and back from one side to the other . When all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks I’ll open the floor to brief questions from the audience . </s>
Third , when the Q & A is complete each debater will make a final statement lasting not more than two minutes each . Fourth , during the closing arguments ballot boxes will be passed around for voting and you’ll put in either the for piece , the against , the against piece or the whole ticket if you still don’t know which side you favor . If anyone doesn’t have a ticket ballot an usher will get you one at the appropriate moment . Fifth and last , after the clo…after the final closing argument is made , uh , statement is made , I will announce the results of the audience vote and tell you which side carried the day . I will now introduce the panel . </s>
For the motion , which is , `` Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad '' – author , commentator , news ana…analyst and law professor , James Hirsen . Now , I’m , I’m going to break my impartiality here -- and I’m not going to do this with anybody else -- except to say that James Hirsen , whom I do not know , has a very unusual sidelight to his background . Because prior to him becoming , you know , uh , very prominent on FOX News and all that stuff , um , he worked as a pro…professional musician and for a number of years was a keyboardist for one of the most legendary groups of all times , and one of my favorites – and , uh , it goes way back – The Temptations . So… MAN All right . </s>
Okay , that’s the big surprise of the evening . Next , um , the art critic , essayist , social commentator and co-editor and publisher of The New Criterion , Roger Kimball . </s>
Resident Scholar at the American Ent…Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research , Joshua Muravchick . Against the motion , the Executive Director of The Creative Coalition , a social and political ad…advocacy organization for the arts and entertainment industry , Robin Bronk . The film producer , director and political activist , Robert Greenwald . And writer of fiction , non-fiction and screenplays and Chairman of the Graduate Program in Screenwriting at UCLA , Richard Walter . Um , now for the motion , um , let’s call up Roger Kimball . </s>
Good evening . I’d like to , uh , thank Mr. Weinraub and Bob Rosenkranz , uh , Dana and all the IQ staff , IQ2 staff , um , for organizing this event and keeping alive the tradition of civil discourse and debate in New York . </s>
Um , it’s , it’s a tradition that is , uh , unfortunately , uh , fallen out of favor in recent years . Um , now , contemplating the motion before us , that Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad , I have to admit that when I first contemplated this I thought of the cartoon strip Calvin and Hobbs . Maybe some of you know this strip . I’m thinking in particular of that , that , uh , cartoon whose first frame shows the little Calvin – he’s six years old , quite a demon – hammering , furiously , nails into a board . </s>
And then in the second frame Calvin’s mother runs into the room , screaming , Calvin , what are you doing to the coffee table ? In the third frame , Calvin looks up with a look of extreme bemusement on his face , saying , Is that a trick question ? Now , we all know that Hollywood in its current incarnation , uh , boasts a , a large quotient of anti-Americanism . </s>
Uh , the names Matt Damon , George Clooney , Alec Baldwin , Barbra Streisand , Michael Moore , Susan , Susan , Susan Sarandon – the , the list goes on and on . We also know that anti-Americanism is alive and well in the world today , alas . Now , what is the connection ? I want to be clear about what the resolution before us – a resolution , by the way , that I , I hope you will support . </s>
It is that Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad . This is , this is where it gets tricky . </s>
This is not a referendum about the Bush Administration , the war in Iraq or any , uh , evils , real or supposed , of American society . It is a resolution about the effect of Hollywood movies and the Hollywood mindset on this phenomenon of anti-Americanism abroad . Now , the first thing to note is that anti-Americanism is what we might call a hearty perennial . It does not need Hollywood to thrive . </s>
It has a long pedigree , born of wealth and power . One thinks of Pericles and what he had to say about , uh , the way in which distinction bred envy , envy bred resentment and resentment , if not checked , bred hatred . Athens , in her day , was cordially hated . Rome , in her day , was cordially hated . So was the British Empire . </s>
As the authors of that great satire , 1066 and All That , reminded , remind us , after the first World War America emerged as what they called top nation . </s>
So it , it assumed the mantle of Great Britain’s , uh , pre-eminence and it also has passed the scepter , uh , as it were , of the world’s antipathy . And that has been something that’s been pretty constant from that time on . There have been intervening moments of gratitude , after 1918 , for example , after 1945 , for example . </s>
But basically then the world slips back into disliking us . </s>
Um , so that’s , that’s no , uh , just a kind of common reality which we , which we live with . That’s one form of anti-Americanism . In our , in the current form , anti-Americanism , I think , was born domestically of the Sixties . It’s a product in part of what the literary critic Lionel Trilling called the adversary culture of the intellectuals – um , fed by the Vietnam War , fed by the radicalism of the Sixties . </s>
We all can remember the students demonstrating in the street , spelling America with a K and so on . Um , something more radical happened abroad . But this is not new either . </s>
You go back to the Carter years . There are plenty of people chanting in the streets , down with the great Satan , death to America , burning American flags . Same thing in the Reagan administration , same thing in the Clinton administration . </s>
The same thing in both Bush administrations . Hoards shouting “Death to America” is always , seems always to be with us . </s>
So anti-Americanism , domestic and foreign , is like a , a kind of rank garden . It thrives . </s>
Hollywood merely supplies a layer of what you might call fructified , fructified manure . Anti-Americanism abroad would exist without Hollywood , just as cancer would exist without cigarette smoke . But Hollywood tends to make the malignancy worse . And it does this I think in two ways . One way is what we might call cultural anti-Americanism . </s>
By making so many trashy , vacuous movies , Hollywood uh , fosters a view of American life that is really at odds with the reality of American society . It um , shows this society to be largely sex-obsessed , violence-obsessed , a society shot through with cynicism about its founding institutions . </s>
And by and large portrays a decadent society in love with nihilism . That’s one way in which Hollywood fuels anti-Americanism abroad , by portraying America as a society that has lost its soul . Another way and perhaps a more virulent way , a more political way , is the way Hollywood , by attacking those institutions of American life uh , shows America to be a bankrupt , corrupt , venal , savage uh , mercenary society . Um these , this side of Hollywood really sort of took off I think in the 1960s during the Vietnam War . </s>
Is there a Vietnam film uh , that shows America as anything other than a horrible , savage , misguided society ? Maybe one or two . One thinks of the Hanoi Hilton but of course that was instantly savaged by critics . </s>
Stanley Kaufman , for example , dismissed it as filth . By and large I think any movie that deals with American society from the 1960s on deals with all of the institutions of American life as something not to be admired but to be disparaged . </s>
When was the last time you saw the president of the United States in a movie portrayed in a favorable light , or the military ? It’s very rare that this happens . </s>
Oliver Stone , I think summed up what , what Hollywood is like now when he says “We have become the enemy.” Hollywood has fueled anti-Americanism abroad to such an extent that for example , German schoolteachers show Bowling for Columbine by Michael Moore as an accurate portrayal of American society . One thinks , for example , of the movie Syriana which blends incomprehensibility with anti-American animists to an extraordinary extent . </s>
Charles Krauthammer said that this movie could have been scripted by Osama Bin Laden and I believe that movies like this , that the general spirit of Hollywood today actively fuels anti-Americanism abroad . And I hope that you will support that motion . </s>
Thank you . Okay , against , we have Richard Walter . Thank you . </s>
You hear it all the time : Hollywood films are corrosive , destructive , decaying . You hear it all , all the time . You hear it from our noble opponents here and you hear it in right- wing talk radio shows . I guess that’s a redundancy if ever there was one . Um I just wonder if it , it worries our friends even just a little bit to find themselves in lock step agreement with Osama Bin Laden . </s>
The fact of the matter is there are a lot of bad movies out there . There are also a lot of bad paintings , a lot of bad sculpture . </s>
You know , most art sucks , excuse me . But here in New York , I stopped in at the Metropolitan Museum , my favorite museum in the world . And I didn’t see one work of art that wasn’t worthy . And you get the impression in museums that all art is fantastic , is beautiful , is wonderful . </s>
When in fact , for every one of those paintings at the museums , there are thousands , indeed tens of thousands , maybe hundreds of thousands that just don’t deserve to be there . With film , because it’s contemporary , even more so in , in television , with television , we don’t have the time to do the culling and the selecting where the best kind of falls away , drops away . People like to look back at the forties and the thirties and say , why don’t they make great films like they did back then ? The fact is they made a lot of lousy movies back then as well . </s>
I think in 2060 they’ll be saying , why don’t they make great films like they did back there at the beginning of the new millennium ? We hear about sex and violence in films as if this was invented by Hollywood . The fact is , dramatic narrative has always been brutal , always been ugly , always been bloody and sexual . Oedipus Rex , he kills his father . </s>
You know what he does to his mother . He pokes his eyes out with jagged , rusty spikes . Medea murders her own children in a jealous rage against her philandering and faithless husband Jason . Uh , not just the Greeks but Shakespeare . I 'm talking now about the greatest , most venerated , most honorable , the most loved dramatic expression of all time . </s>
Hamlet ends up with nine corpses on the stage . We counted them up in class . Some of them had been run through on swords , some of them had been poisoned . </s>
Macbeth kills his own king who is a guest in his house , and he does it out of pure ambition , out of pure greed . Richard III killed his own nephews who were boys , nine and eleven years old . </s>
Um , this was not invented by eleven Jews at Paramount Studios a couple of weeks ago last Thursday . </s>
This is the way dramatic uh , expression operates . It’s all about conflict , and uh , you know nobody wants to see the village of the happy nice people . </s>
Rational discourse , even handed discussion has its place , for example right here . But art is not it . Certainly dramatic art is , is not it . Now what you hear about Hollywood all the time is crass commercialism , all they care about is , is making money . Oh Hollywood just obsesses about the bottom line . </s>
Now , Hollywood care about the bottom line ? </s>
Of course it does , but what business doesn’t ? That’s not unique to the entertainment business . </s>
The dry cleaner at the corner has to make the bottom line . The insurance business has to meet the bottom line , manufacturing , uh , construction . </s>
If you don’t make the bottom line , you 're out of business . Everything stands on the bottom line , that’s why it’s called the bottom line . And Hollywood’s interest in the bottom line is no different from any other business enterprise . And it’s interesting to me that people who consider themselves conservatives and very pro-business , not what I believe is America’s greatest business , which is information and entertainment , which is what I mean when we talk metaphorically about this thing uh , called Hollywood . So really there is , there’s absolutely nothing unique to that . </s>
I think what the problem is has a lot to do with the fact that we are so now inundated with images . We see so much media everywhere you go , even a man at a urinal , excuse me again , will see advertising . </s>
I’ve even seen digital screens . Um , a guy my age has plenty of time , let me tell you to look at all of that stuff . </s>
And we can’t tell any longer the difference between what’s real and what’s not . There’s no more East and West . You go to Beijing and you can be in , in uh , you know , at Banana Republic and J . Crew . </s>
There’s no more men and women , that is to say , women do what men used to do and vice versa . </s>
Uh , no more renters and landlords . I know there are but in another generation it was , it , it , it was like that . Now it really , for many of us , maybe most of us in this room , it is not . </s>
I think people can’t tell the difference any longer between images and the actual things that the images represent . I was approached by a boxing , the management for a boxer , a very famous prizefighter . It doesn’t matter who it is , his initials are Evander Holyfield . And they wanted him to move into an acting career and they were looking for material because I see a lot of new screenplays by a lot of new writers . </s>
And they wanted , they warned me though , they cautioned me that he considers himself a very religious man and a role model for young men and therefore he refuses to be seen in a movie that depicts him as causing damage , as causing harm to anybody . A prizefighter . I mean he’s made , he’s made his living , he’s achieved his fame , he has a management team that’s able to approach the professor because he has literally beat men into unconsciousness with his fist . </s>
And this is not a diatribe against the fight game . God forgive me , I love a great prizefight . </s>
In Los Angeles , it’s now impossible to , it’s illegal to own a lookalike replica handgun . You can’t tell if it’s real or not . It could be used in a crime . A real one that can actually blow your brains out is absolutely legal . I , I hold this up to you as an example of how people no longer can tell the difference between symbols of things and the things that these symbols represent . </s>
And likewise , lets look to anti-American sentiment abroad . What could be causing that ? It could n't be the ruinous policies of this recent administration . It’s got to be Hollywood movies . </s>
So much easier to , to believe that . I must tell you I’ve traveled all around the world , I 'm privileged to travel all the world and , and to lecture on screen writing issues and talk to film development corporations . And we are very much loved all around the world . </s>
I had the privilege of teaching Masters classes last spring in Paris and London and imagine my good fortune that I could stand in front of you and actually truthfully pronounce that , that sentence to you . And in the lobby of the conservatoire in Paris , there are two dozen posters of movies all around the room . And this is in mean old America-loathing France . And twenty-one of the movies are Hollywood movies , are American films . Only three of them were French films . </s>
The truth is we are loved all around the world for our , our film . </s>
The films show that we’re an open society . </s>
Do we want to go back as Jim suggested in the piece that I read to the good ol’ days when everybody was white and women knew their place ? I do n't think so . Thank you very , very much . Okay , now for the motion , Joshua Muravchick . I was going to tell you a great joke to start off with but there’s not enough time , so just laugh please . </s>
I want , I 'm going to start off with a movie that I enjoyed very much and that made me laugh a lot , uh forty ideas ago . But I think it symbolizes a great deal of the problem which we’re speaking about , and that was the movie Dr. Strangelove . The thesis of that movie was that the American nuclear arms and American armament in general was not driven by any real danger to our country but was rather driven by the militarism , chauvinism , paranoia of American officials , even with some bizarre root or connection in Nazi Germany . And this film in fact symbolized a thesis about the Cold War and America’s role in it that was believed by many Americans , but even more by foreigners , and that was propagated again and again by Hollywood films , namely that the two parties to the Cold War were equally guilty , equally afraid of one another . They were like two scorpions in a bottle . </s>
Unlike most historical interpretations , this was one where we’re able to find out at the end the truth of falsity . That is , we found out it was utterly false . We found this out in 1989 when there came to the fore in the Soviet Union a ruler , Gorbachev , who no longer wanted to wage Cold War against United States . And the moment that he stepped forward and was prepared to solve the issues of which we were at odds and to uh , and to stop being competitors , the Cold War ended instantly because it never was an equally two sided war . </s>
It was a war of offense on the other side , aggression on one side and , and defense on the other . </s>
A uh , a point that was consistently misrepresented by Hollywood . Still worse than that kind of moral equivalence that you could see again and again in films were people who , whom there were many in Hollywood . </s>
And uh , whose ideas were represented in many films , that said in fact , we were the bad guys . </s>
And the good guys in the Cold War were the Uncle Joe Stalin and the Soviet Union and his heirs , the emblematic figure of this view of the world was Lillian Hellman , who was a Communist but pretended not to be . And who uh , and who in fact even once , wrote a film called Song of Russia . And the film Song of Russia , Mr. Walter , was exactly a film portraying a village of the happy nice people . Except this village of the happy nice people was a collective farm which in fact in reality was a form of uh , death dealing slave labor . But brought to the screen in Hollywood as a kind of a , a Brady Bunch lifestyle , speaking Russian . </s>
This , but Hellman was far from alone in this . </s>
In fact the view that supported the other side in the Cold War was widespread in Hollywood . </s>
And in fact , a subsequent mythology was created and is perpetuated to this day by Hollywood about the reaction against this support for the other side in the Cold War . </s>
That is , we hear a lot about and we still to this day , hear about the Hollywood Ten who have been presented in one after another Hollywood film over the decades , including this decade as ten idealistic , humanitarian liberals who were persecuted by the authoritarian state of the United States with the consistent obfuscation or outright denial of the now documented fact that all ten of these Hollywood Ten were Communist Party members , and were themselves engaged in a collective effort to blacklist and suppress people who were anti- Communist and prevent them from advancing their careers in Hollywood . But you don’t have to love Stalin to hate America , and in a later era we got people who made famous and popular Hollywood films that hated America without loving Stalin , of whom the emblematic example is Oliver Stone , who created these various films of paranoid fantasies , purported to be actual history . And , and one of which the murder of President Kennedy was a coup plotted by Vice President Johnson , and another which has implied that the murder of President Kennedy was in fact carried out by President Nixon or inspired by President Nixon . Elsewhere , Mr. Stone has told us that the murder of the President’s brother , Robert Kennedy , was carried out by the FBI . </s>
And when you look around the world and see in places like the Middle East the kind of paranoid , bizarre theories about 9/11 or other things that go on in the world , these are things that I think in all likelihood are fed and encouraged by these very popular presentations in American films , by the likes of Oliver Stone , which in fact are just as far fetched as the theory that four thousand Jews didn’t show up to work at the World Trade Center on 9/11 . As I said , Mr. Stone parades as if he’s a historian . Other Hollywood film makers are much more modest and don’t pretend to be making anything other than entertainment . And yet if you watch the uh , the thriller genre in recent years , you see that there’s a kind of set pattern that reappears again and again and again . </s>
That is , well as you go along in the film and you find out who is the real evil force at the inner sanctum behind the bad guys in the film , it is invariably the CIA . </s>
The Pentagon , the President , some aide to the President , or American multinational corporations . This uh , uh , this uh , current , this genre being epitomized recently by Syriana that was referred to . But I think the best representation of that is by the remake of The Manchurian Candidate . Manchurian Candidate was a film in the fifties which showed someone being manipulated and brainwashed and used for diabolical purposes by the government of Communist China , of Mao Zedong . In the twenty-first century version of The Manchurian Candidate , it’s no more Mao Zedong , it’s some multinational corporation vaguely reminiscent of uh , Halliburton or the Carlyle Group . </s>
So here we have a new sensibility , that is on the one hand , we have this evil Halliburton , Carlyle , whatever people who have actually done such terrible things as gouging on contracts that they have fulfilled with the US government . </s>
And clearly this is supposed to be more horrible to us now in our new modern sensibility than the government of China of Mao Zedong . </s>
Josh , it’s time . I didn’t hear you say one minute . I said one minute before . Um , alright my , I 'm sorry I didn’t hear you . My closing had to do with the clown prince of anti-Americanism , Michael Moore . </s>
But I’ll save it for the question period . I said one . </s>
Um , okay against is Robin Bronk . I wanted to take ten seconds of my time for a nod to my esteemed colleague , Mr. Kimball for the ex- , due expression that I hope that we can all take with us , fructifying manure . </s>
And I will try and use it in every one of my speeches . Has Hollywood fueled anti- Americanism abroad ? </s>
Where’s the evidence that we should be asking this question at all ? Yes , there’s a lot of anti- Americanism , yes Hollywood exists . </s>
But where’s the connection ? What’s the cause and effect ? We have the peoples , we have people’s responses to why they’ve become anti-American in the past few years . </s>
None of them mention Hollywood . What’s the problem with the data ? Now if you were to posit Hollywood as the problem , even though there is no data to support this thesis , what would be the tipping point ? In other words , Hollywood has been around since the early twentieth century . Anti-Americanism has peaked in recent years . </s>
And in a way we last saw during the Vietnam War . </s>
Would anyone wish to argue that Hollywood has fundamentally changed in the past six years ? What films would you point to , to support the contention ? </s>
Well if you didn’t like Fahrenheit 911 , what about Flight 92 and the spade of extremely patriotic movies that have recently come out ? Men of Honor , Thirteen Days , Saving Private Ryan , Patriot . Well of course Hollywood releases lots of different kinds of films . But where has any reputable study anywhere found a direct tie between the kinds of films being produced at the given moment and a rising anti-American sentiment around the world ? In fact , the opposite appears true . </s>
Hollywood is frequently what appeals to foreigners about America , even those who detest our foreign policy . It’s called show business . </s>
Hollywood Studios are owned by global multinational conglomerates whose goal is to maximize their shareholder value . They do this by trying to produce a product , a product that will appeal to the widest possible audience . To do this , they must do their respective best to appeal to the most broad marketplace , here and abroad . And unless you believe that Hollywood is run by a conspiracy , then all Hollywood is doing is reflecting the values of the people to whom it seeks to appeal . Now if you would argue , again , absent any data or evidence of any kind , that this somehow increases the incidence of anti- Americanism , then what you 're really arguing is that American values and the values of the global marketplace are the cause of anti-Americanism . </s>
And if that’s the case , and I would contend that it’s not , then you 're really objecting both to capitalism itself and to the way that Americans like to think of themselves as citizens and consumers . </s>
That sounds kind of anti-American to me , and moreover , it sounds like you 're shooting the messenger . In America against the world , how we are different and why we are disliked , based on ninety-one thousand interviews conducted in fifty nations from 2002 to 2005 by the Pew Research Center , the authors write that “while the first hints that the world was becoming troubled by America came soon after the election of George W. Bush , and that whatever global goodwill the United States has in the wake of the September 11th attacks appears to have quickly dissipated after the Iraq invasion . Favorable opinions had more than slipped . </s>
They had plummeted.” And it’s grown worse since May when that was published . The most recent Pew finding showed that favorable opinions of the US had gone from eighty-three percent in 2000 to fifty-six percent in 2006 in Britain , seventy-eight to thirty-seven in Germany , sixty-two to thirty nine in France . When one looks at the results of these surveys , you see tremendous international opposition to the War in Iraq and America’s policies on global warming . </s>
If you speak with foreign leaders , you hear genuine concerns about specific aspects of US foreign policy , the refusal to agree with the Kyoto Treaty and global warming . The withdrawal from the International Criminal Court , the War in Iraq , difficulty getting visas to visit the United States . Perhaps I 'm looking at the wrong polls or talking with the wrong foreigners . </s>
But I’ve yet to hear anyone mention Everybody Loves Raymond reruns as the fuel feeding the anti-American fire raging across so much of the globe . </s>
And that’s leading the whole world to , I was going to say that word but I guess I can’t say that word since this is on NPR but that’s a different uh , subject . Taking to that place down below in a hand basket . Thank you . Okay now um , for , we have James Hirsen . </s>
Now that Pew Poll that uh , was cited by Robin , uh , I have to say has some statistical problems because in terms of France , Germany , and Britain , they over-sampled the Muslim population , sampling them at levels close to fifty percent . </s>
And that accounts a great , for a great deal of the change . When considering this motion , whether you 're going to support it , the real question is whether the America that you see in the generic Hollywood that constitutes television shows and movies and music , is the same America that we all live in and work in . </s>
I mean what if your only glimpse of the United States was the latest report of Britney Spears , Lindsay Lohan , and Paris Hilton and their boycott of underpants ? Um in nations around the globe , there are lots of people who have never been to the United States . Now Richard Walter has traveled the world and he said he was privileged to do so , but there’s lots of people that have not . And they’ve never come here , they’ve never met you . And so their only impression is the export of the pop culture by the Hollywood community . </s>
And that includes all of this product . It includes television , and music , and movies . Uh , an appearance on The View by Danny DeVito . And once upon a time , as Richard Walter alluded to talking about the thirties and forties in Hollywood , there’s a nickname for this , it’s called a Golden Age . It’s for a reason because iconic images were sent around the world , images of Henry Fonda , images of Clark Gable , images of John Wayne . </s>
And the world fell in love with America , and they fell in love with those Hollywood images . And there was a , a set of values . </s>
There was optimism and there was courage . And there was unshakable belief in freedom , and unshakable belief in fairness . To , to show you how much it shifted um , in the period , is it , John Wayne who was made into the symbol of America by director John Ford , the cowboy was rugged and independent and gallant and true . </s>
We move forward to 1969 when the first film that was X-rated wins the best picture . </s>
Uses the name cowboy , it’s Midnight Cowboy . And here the cowboy’s profession is relegated to that of a male prostitute . The cowboys uh , follow in the long way . </s>
But things continued in what Roger Kimball called the cultural anti- Americanism . Since the 1960s , that what people see around the world is an America of extreme violence , of rampant crime , of unapologetic narcissism , of licentious exhibitionism , and self- loathing . And this is misshapen . </s>
It’s distorted . It’s a place where even Tony Soprano would run to his therapist . And look at rap lyrics . I mean rap lyrics…not all of it , but a lot of it , have themes of assaulting women , dealing drugs , killing the police . </s>
In many cases—well , actually , almost all cases—women are described either as female dogs , or garden utensils . And the—and the export of this pop culture has increased . Um , multiplexes were built in Europe , and , uh , the , the exports have gone up to a level of 40—to 50 percent of film box office , is on foreign shores . That includes the films that my colleagues brought up , uh , Syriana and Michael Moore’s Fahrenheit 9/11 which has been very popular in the Afghan case . Um , America’s recent film exports , though , took the idea of artistic license in relation to violent scenes to a whole new level . </s>
We have a whole new genre of films that are doing big box office abroad , and they deal with nothing but…sadistic , senseless , sickening torture . I’m talking about films like Hostel , which did $ 33 million abroad , the Saw series , there’s three of them , they did $ 160 million abroad . </s>
These films , Hostel’s plot is a group of young people who are traveling , who are taken prisoner by an organization that allows businessmen to torture and kill for entertainment . There’s no plot . And they lead our neighbors abroad to believe , that America is deviant , and despicable and violent . It’s no wonder that , we have , uh , heard this nickname of Israel as “the little Satan” by some of the people we’re fighting against , and they call us “the great Satan.” </s>
As a matter of fact , uh , Robin referred to studies…this isn’t a poll but it certainly is an event when , right after 9/11 one month later , angry mobs went to the local cinemas , and burnt down five of them that contained American films . I guess they gave it a thumbs-down . The , uh…the , the other aspect of Hollywood that’s very disturbing , is the way representatives of free enterprise are depicted . </s>
Business people , executives , and corporations . Um , you know , I—I would expect that in a town that , that writes scripts that every once in a while we’d see , uh , a corporate executive as a villain . But it’s almost always that way . Oliver Stone made Wall Street , named his main character Gekko , and he extolled the virtues of greed . In Syriana , as , um…you know , uh , my colleagues have brought up , which , by the way , George Clooney used the Charlize Theron formula to win an Oscar . </s>
That’s you pack up the—pack on the pounds and then pick up an Oscar . And in , in that film , there’s a business executive with a suit that explains anti-Americanism . </s>
Explains the reason America is successful , he says , “Corruption is why we win.” Hollywood hasn’t even left their remakes alone . When they remade The Fugitive , all of a sudden they have to have a pharmaceutical corporate as a co-conspirator with the one-armed man that was not in the original television show . </s>
Uh , my colleague , uh , Josh brought up The Manchurian Candidate . Which inexplicably changed the villainous totalitarian government , into a corporation . The Manchurian Corporation , what do they manufacture ? One minute . </s>
So apparently in Hollywood wealth is taken for granted , it’s a zero-sum game , a finite pie , where if one person wins , then another loses . </s>
Uh , last year , there was a remake of a famous American symbol . Superman . And Superman has always been associated with the phrase , “Truth , justice , and the American way.” And if you went to the film , you noticed , there was no American way , or it was taken out . </s>
And maybe that’s because , Hollywood has manufactured a new American way that does not fit with either truth , or justice . </s>
Okay , and Robert Greenwald . Thank you . </s>
Somehow it seems that , um… our panelists , some of our panelists have the notion , that the only America people around the world see , is the one in movies and television . Do they truly believe , that these people all over the world are idiots and morons , who have no idea what is going on with this horrific war ? </s>
Do they really believe that over and over again it’s a Hollywood movie , rather than the killings , the terrorism , the bombings…the friends , the relatives , the relatives that people know , who are being…subjected…and dying in this horrific situation ? Do they really think that an hour in front of a TV set counters all of the news , and all of the TV reports , and all of the paper reports ? Truly hard for me to imagine . Does Josh really think that the war that he advocated for has less of an effect on people than watching a movie ? </s>
Or that if we follow his lead and go to war with Iran , that that will in any way…any way do anything but continue to destroy the country that we love ? The country that Oliver Stone loves ? </s>
The country that Michael Moore loves ? The people in the community in Los Angeles who love , we may disagree with them , but the notion that we say they hate America , is one I personally find disgusting . Let me go back to 9/11 for a minute . We all remember…I was not in New York , many of you were here , the terrible time , the tragedy . </s>
And then this amazing , amazing outpouring , around the world . Embracing us . Supporting us . </s>
Offering help to us . The spectrum of countries who came forward and wanted to be with us at this time was truly something to behold . We know it from the information , we know it from the news sources , people I’m sure here have individual stories , when you would call somebody from another country and what they would say and how they would reach out to us . </s>
And then that changed , right ? And then to use the Pew study which we can argue about endlessly but I think you’re totally wrong on the over-sampling issue . To use the Pew study again we saw , after the Iraq war , a big drop , right ? Turkey went from 52 % of the country supporting us to 12 % . Britain , our ally , 83 % to 56 % . </s>
And Jordan from 20 % to 1 % had supported us , and now , over a period of years were no longer . Well , I’m absolutely sure that the reason for that was Ocean’s 11 . That’s exactly the reason , or maybe it was Shrek , no , I think maybe it was Shrek , that caused that terrible fall-off to happen . </s>
That really would explain the statistical drop , right ? I mean , it makes perfect sense . </s>
This was a war of choice…that our country went into . The world was opposed to us in the world—in this war of choice . Now people can argue we still should’ve done it . But we know the world was opposed to this war of choice . </s>
We invaded , we went in , we occupied a country in the Middle East with oil resources . And now , Pew study again , in 14 out of 16 countries , a majority think the world has been made less safe because of that war . I’m sure that those facts are due to Spider Man . </s>
There’s no question that that must have been the reason that people changed their thinking . Or maybe it was in Men in Black , I think that probably would’ve made the case more effectively . The war goes on , it continues , the polling numbers around the world continue to get worse and worse for the country we love , for the country we care about . </s>
America is not trusted around the world . </s>
And as a patriot , that’s a terrible , terrible thing . And that’s not because of any fantasy TV program . </s>
That’s not because of a trashy , crappy , awful movie that Hollywood’s made and…I’ve occasionally made some of those movies . </s>
That’s not the reason and we know that and I think any rational , sensible , thinking person knows where that comes from . It comes from reality . Hollywood is fantasy , gentlemen . Hollywood makes up stuff . </s>
But there’s a reality out there that trumps any kind of bad screenwriter , or salacious material , there’s a reality that’s facing people all over the world , day in and day out . And we have to look at that reality . We have to embrace and deal with the truth of what’s in front of us . </s>
This is a diversion . This is , uh , it’s not—it’s beyond shooting the messenger . This is trying to find some simple little answer , rather than looking at , truly , a terrible , terrible situation , which is going to take us amazing years and time and effort , to overcome . Which is this rising and increasing tide of anti-Americanism . </s>
And the United States says we’re not in favor of the World Court . And it refuses to sign the global warming agreement . </s>
And we hear about Abu Ghraib . </s>
And in Britain , 41 % of the country says the US is a greater threat than Iran . This is not because of Barbra Streisand . This is not because of Sean Penn . </s>
This is not because of the Happy Feet movie . </s>
I think that , we must remind ourselves over and over again , what Hollywood does , is fiction . Let’s make sure that we understand that , let’s put fiction its proper place , yes , it can have some influence on people , yes , you can get annoyed at seeing somebody who’s not acting properly . </s>
Yes , you can get turned off if there’s free sex or materialism . But is that the reason , compared to this extraordinary situation , again , a war of choice , and a war where we’ve not been able to convince the world for any of the reasons— One minute . We’ve not been able to con—remember , we went to this war , the world’s opposed to us , all kinds of reasons , and we’ve not been able to convince the world of any of those reasons . Whatever the reasons of the moment are , from the weapons of mass destruction or Al Qaeda’s connection to Saddam or democracy . </s>
And we think Hollywood is in any way causing the rise of un-Americanism ? </s>
It , in many ways , defies logic , and defies reason . So…I urge all of you to vote your rational selves , not to vote a Hollywood fantasy scriptwriter who might make up a notion , that yes , some silly movie was going to affect people all over the world , rather than what’s going on today . Okay , I want to thank everybody on , um…on my right and left . And , um , I’m now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate vote . Um , and I got a look at it while you all were talking and this is as…this is like the 2000 Florida vote , it’s very , very close . </s>
Before the debate—this is before the debate . </s>
40 % of you voted for , 35 % against , but 25 % don’t know . So there’s a lot of “don’t knows , ” okay ? Now…we’re now ready to begin the Q & A portion of the program , and , and I’ll call on the questioners . I have one question . As the moderator I have the right to at least one question , but I have one . </s>
And I have a question for one of the people on my right . Just one of them , you can answer . </s>
The five biggest films overseas abroad in the last 20 years , maybe longer , 25 years , are… Titanic , Star Wars Episode 1 , E.T. , Pirates of the Caribbean , and Lord of the Rings . None of these , obviously , are , I mean , are political , none of these…have a point of view that could be construed as anti-American . </s>
How do you… how do you construe that given the argument of…of films causing anti-Americanism ? I’d be glad to respond to that . Go ahead . Uh— Uh , the proposition here is not that all films , uh , are anti-American . </s>
But the fact is that one that you didn’t mention that may not have been among the five biggest sellers but that’s tremendously influential in Europe is Michael Moore . Michael Moore at one given moment , was the author of , uh , three books out of the top six on the best-seller list in Germany , number one , two , and six , these books that were based on , on— or that… repeat the themes of his movies which , uh , I laughed when I heard Robert Greenwald say that , that , he loves his country . Let me give you a sample of Michael Moore . “Americans are possibly the dumbest people on the planet , in thrall to conniving , thieving , smug assholes . </s>
We Americans suffer from an enforced ignorance . We don’t know about anything that’s happening outside our country , our stupidity is embarrassing.” And Michael Moore has achieved the stature of a cult figure in Germany , and , and immense popularity , I think Germany is probably the country where he’s most popular , but all around Europe he enjoys a , a , uh…a popularity near that dimension . America , for everything that’s wrong and disgusting , stupid and idiotic in our country . </s>
So he says , uh , you know , “I agree with the National Rifle Association when they say guns don’t kill people , people kill people . Except I would alter that say , guns don’t kill people , Americans kill people . And we are the only country that does this , and we do it on a personal level in our neighborhoods and within our families and schools and we do it on a global level , ” close quote . Uh , this is a man who berates us for ignorance who apparently has never heard of , uh , Iraq , Palestine , Bosnia , Somalia , Congo , Rwanda , Russia , Chechnya , et cetera . </s>
So , uh , it may well be that the most popular films in America and abroad , that are produced by Hollywood , are films that are not political at all . But , um , but there are plenty of films that are political , and those go in one direction , and contrary to Mr. Greenwald who says what Hollywood does is fiction , Michael Moore presents himself as doing fact , as presenting documentaries . </s>
And he even has a team of lawyers and fact- checkers and threatens , publicly , repeatedly , to sue anyone , uh , who dares to challenge or contradict or impugn him , so , uh , I’m hoping his lawyers are listening , I’m ready . Okay , let me just , um , let’s start with , um— Let’s start with the questions . Um…yes , Miss . Thank you , I—I have a question for those against the motion . I want to put a finer point on the question itself and the way you’ve addressed it . </s>
One , um—the question isn’t whether Hollywood was responsible for the anti-Americanism abroad , the question is whether it has fueled that anti-Americanism . And we’re seeing a lot of movies coming out of Hollywood that use stereotypes . It used to be Russians and Communists during the Cold War . Now we have almost cartoon-like Arabs and Muslims in the movies . </s>
Do the panelists against the motion feel that that adds to anti- Americanism abroad generally . Well , I’ll speak to that , I think , uh , no , I don’t believe that that fuels anti-Americanism . Movies like Michael Moore’s movie , and I think Michael Moore is an overfed , underloved narcissist , I’m not a fan . </s>
Uh , but when people abroad look at a movie like that , what they see about America is that America’s a place where people can be critical of the—of their own nation . Um— </s>
I—I— I’m sorry— I sponsored a—I try to cut down on some of my activities but I could—as a Jew and as an American I could not turn down the Fulbright Commission when they asked me to , uh , sponsor an Egyptian scholar , I had to reach out to my Arab Muslim brother , particularly at this time , don’t you think . And what he loved about America was its ability to , uh , be critical of the administration , he said if people spoke that way of Mubarek they would be… disappeared , or off the street . American films , uh…they extol , essentially , the American dream , and what is the American dream , the American dream is a certain materialism to be sure , nothing wrong with that . </s>
People who can’t get the basic material , food , clothing , shelter for themselves , for their children , they will listen to any tyrant , any dictator . We’ve seen dreadful , dreadful history , uh , throughout history and especially the last 100 years , testifying to the truth of that proposition . So a certain materialism’s okay and people across the world , they , they just love what they see , they love the material stuff that they see in , in Hollywood films , but more to the point… Hollywood films extol the notion of the American dream , and what is the American dream . It’s the notion that if you’re willing to work hard , if you’re willing to get educated , in this country you can do anything . </s>
You can move up from your lowly station and achieve anything if you’re just willing to again get educated and , and , uh , and work real hard . Now people will tell you on both sides that that’s a hoax , that’s kind of like the lottery designed to , uh , let people , uh , imagine they can do things that they can’t , but I must tell you from my perch at UCLA and in Hollywood , I see people break through every day , you’ll hear that it’s about connections , who you know . </s>
That’s bunk , I know really well-connected people who can not get arrested in Hollywood and I see absolute fresh faces break through every day . Like it , don’t like it , there’re so many myths , so many hoaxes about Hollywood , one of the biggest among them , is that it is not a meritocracy , it’s all about connections . The fact is that Hollywood is a remarkably democratic place , and truly a meritocracy , people succeed on the basis of their talent , on the basis of their ingenuity and their , their discipline , and it’s a great credit to this nation , I think it’s the greatest industry that we have . One sentence in reply , we were encouraged to break in . Uh , Richard , it may be perfectly true that in some authoritarian countries , if they see a film , an American film that is viciously , uh , hostile to the American government , they say , oh , in America they have free speech , I wish I did too , that— that—that point is valid , but I was talking about Europe . </s>
And they have just as much free speech in Europe and France and the UK as we have here . And when those audiences , uh…eat up what Michael Moore is offering , they’re not sitting there saying , oh , isn’t this wonderful , there’s free speech in the United States . Joshua— Okay—I’m sorry , go on . </s>
Joshua , you scare me . I mean you’re , you are scaring me . And , and that’s fueling my anti-Americanism right now . </s>
But— And just to add , and just to underscore what one of the questioners said , and that is that if you’re supporting the motion , the motion is not seeking the sole causative factor of America , uh , anti-Americanism . It’s saying whether it’s fueled . And also it doesn’t say that motion pictures are the sole cause . </s>
We’re talking about generic Hollywood , which includes the export of the pop culture , which includes television and music , et cetera . It’s the entire pop culture and what we’re depicting as an American image . So are you asking for a , uh , a completely whitewashed export , export ? So we should all go back to the days of June Cleaver and , and promote the wear – maybe we should all be wearing pearls and vacuuming . Is that , is that what you want ? </s>
Well , I think it’s been , it’s been clearly defined that the motion we’re debating has nothing to do with censorship . As a matter of fact – and I applaud – It’s not clear . He’s asking for censorship . </s>
No , no , he’s not . He’s saying , Censor things that I don’t agree with . No , we’re asking for responsibility . I didn’t say anything about that . Of course you are . </s>
When did I say that ? What did I -- ? You don’t , you , you don’t want to have Michael Moore have a voice or , or , or anyone else that you don’t seem to agree with . Josh did not say that . That’s not true . </s>
I mean , that’s , that’s nonsense . I didn’t say anything like that . </s>
And you know , and you know what ? I think , I think we can have some questions . </s>
I , uh , uh , I don’t , I don’t want to censor him , uh , but I want to pour my own , uh , uh , contempt on him . And I want to expose him for what he is . Well , you know – Well , make a documentary and pour your contempt on him . Uh , you know , I think we have some questions for – </s>
Well , I’m not a filmmaker . I’m , I’m a , uh , writer and a speaker . So I’m here speaking . </s>
Yeah , but , uh , Robin -- </s>
And , and I’m exposing Michael Moore for what he is . </s>
But Robin , you’re scaring me . Okay , let’s have some questions . </s>
Um , sir . WOMAN Here , right here . Right here , sir . Oh , I’m sorry . Uh -- </s>
Uh -- He , and after , this man after him . I , I think I’m going to , uh , uh , yield the floor to the gentleman down there , as the two questions that I was going to ask have both been debated and , and talked about already . Okay , this , this gentleman over here . WOMAN Sir , here you go . </s>
Uh , most of what I’ve heard tonight , if you’ll pardon me , has not had a whole lot of intellectual rigor attached to it . Okay . Whoo . I heard some very salient points from both sides . </s>
I think Michael Moore , how can I say , as a professional documentary , uh , I’m going to say , maker really should go some place else because there are people that misconstrue what he says . But he follows , he doesn’t lead . Okay ? I think that we’ve had people abroad for a very long time . </s>
It’s those people that have created impressions about how we behave , what we do , what we care about . I think , uh , Paul Theroux made a point in , uh , one of his last books , Traveling in the Third World , where he said something about people don’t hate Americans . People hate our government . Boo . </s>
Okay , I think that movies basically follow , okay . And there’s been something out there for a long time . It’s not Hollywood . </s>
It’s every industry we’ve got that’s out there that’s exporting a certain way . And those are the problems . And it’s not , if you will , industry generic . Okay . But do you have a question for any , any of , any of us ? </s>
Well . </s>
Sorry , sorry . Yes . </s>
I would say , other than , uh , sorry Robin , that , uh , I haven’t heard anything really supportive , other than sort of broad innuendo , okay , uh , about this and that . </s>
I think that it’s all connecting . </s>
Okay . </s>
Alright , okay . And I’d like to hear some really more , how do you say , substantive facts about how we proceed . Thank you . Um , I hope I’m not , uh , rendering this to be redundant when I say that as , um , someone who is not American I can confirm that , uh , Hollywood has fueled , uh , anti- Americanism abroad . Um , growing up in , uh , in Europe I , um , I sense an extreme cynicism on the part of , um , of , you know , my , my , uh , my peers , um , in the sense of the smugness , um , with which American represents itself . </s>
I mean , I -- Uh , but do you have a question ? Yes , I do . </s>
And , uh , and what I’d like to , to , to ask is that , is , uh , what do the members of the panel feel about , uh , the makeup of the panel in the sense that there are , are conservatives who were saying that , you know – who , who I agree with , essentially . But at the same time , um , I am ex…extremely kind of like , um , disillusioned with American foreign policy and the war , particularly . And , um , and I wonder why there’s such a demarcation of , um , of opinion . </s>
Um , I , I agree with James Hirsen in the sense that , um , you don’t have , you know , Hollywood is not the , the only factor . </s>
But at the same time , um , it , it is a factor . But , um – Okay , yeah . I won…I won…I just wonder what people have to say about that . </s>
Well , we’ve , we’ve sort of covered that . You know , that , how , it , it’s Hollywood and it’s , um , policy . </s>
We , uh , yes sir . WOMAN Sir , here you are , sir . Hand that over to him , please . Yeah , I have a question for Mr. Greenwald . I was , uh – </s>
Okay . </s>
…impressed that you in some , took advantage of your political activity and your personal feelings about the war . You didn’t mention one part of it , and I don’t know why , and that , people seem to be frightened to mention – and that is our support for Israel . My son just got back from Jordan , where he’s doing some work on Middle East policy . </s>
And he said he was shocked how radicalized Jordan had become in the last month , that they , they have their hatred for us because of our support of our support of , quote , `` the little Satan . '' </s>
The European countries feel the same way . And when they belittle and undermine American policy and look at our motion pictures as an example of our lives it just furthers their hatred for us . </s>
And they don’t know why we’re supporting Israel at the expense of their nation . </s>
Now we know why . All right , but what is that , you say , let me just , uh , uh – </s>
Yeah . </s>
Just , uh , what does that have to do with Hollywood ? </s>
Because he was making statements as a political activist that he brought this , uh , business about the war in when they were talking about motion pictures . </s>
Right , okay . So my question is , I think there’s a big part of it that’s being overlooked here – is that our support of Israel , which I fully support , is a large part of the hatred of America today . </s>
All right , but let’s , okay , let’s , let’s just stick – Uh , I appreciate that , sir . </s>
Okay . But let’s just stick to the issue of Hollywood and Hollywood’s impact on , you know , foreign , uh , on abroad and what impact it has , either positive or negative , and , you know , um , let’s stick to has Hollywood , Hollywood has fueled anti- Americanism abroad . Has it or has it not ? </s>
Yes sir . </s>
Well , to your point – and to go back to the point this lady made , uh , which was the , I thought the most intelligent comment that anybody’s made so far – which is that the , uh , the side against has , um , distorted this entire , uh , debate by , by moving off the `` Hollywood has fueled anti- Americanism abroad '' issue to the war . </s>
We are not discussing the impact of the war . </s>
The war has its own impact . </s>
We all know that . But for you to , to de…deflect that , uh , into this , this , this main issue , I think is not really meeting the point of the debate . And therefore by definition you lose . Well , I , I , I quite disagree . </s>
You’re not arguing the , you’re not arguing the point . Uh , I don’t think it’s fair at all what you say , respectfully . Uh , we’re , we know there is a rise around the world , uh , in anti-American sentiment . Um , we’re arguing that’s it not , not , uh , Hollywood fueling that . </s>
Aren’t we allowed to say what we think , uh , just might have something to do with that ? Can anybody doubt , if you read the papers , what it is that , uh , that , that fuels this – these wrongheaded and disastrous policies that represent the opposite of the American ideal and the American tradition ? Yeah , but there was a lot of anti – If , if it was , if it was a le – If it was a court case and Hollywood was being tried as , you know , the guilty one for the crime we’re saying , No , we know who the guilty one for the crime is . </s>
We know what that guilty is and it’s the war . There’s no , no question about it . I understand your point and we could parse the words . What does fuel mean ? </s>
How much fuel ? But I actually think it’s much more substantive to go to the real , the real question -- or the real question behind the question , from my point of view , maybe not yours – and say , Here is why anti- Americanism is being fueled a…abroad . </s>
We know the reason . MAN Yes , but that -- Yes , but that would assume that , that anti- Americanism is a new phenomenon . It’s not . </s>
We’ve had it – No . No , not new . But the numbers are – Uh , there’s no – Do you doubt that the numbers are increasing ? Yes , I do . </s>
I do . Since – Wait a minute . You don’t think since the Iraqi War that it’s not increased ? Well , I , I , I can – …that it’s not increasing numbers because you questioned whether we could debate the statistics . </s>
Yes , and I’ve got the… The Pew poll sampled – I got , you got your copy , I got mine . </s>
…sampled , uh , nine hundred and two people in Great Britain . Four hundred and twelve of them were Muslim . Nine hundred and five in France , four hundred were Muslim . That’s… Nine hundred and two in Germany , four hundred and thirteen are Muslim . </s>
That does not reflect the percentages of the populations in those countries . That poll , that poll is statistically invalid . Um , well , let me get this . </s>
Yes sir . </s>
I’m sorry . Well , wait , wait , wait . I , I want to get in on this , please . Okay . </s>
Because , uh , the , the two , the two people in the audience , uh , nailed this point more , uh , most clearly . It is , it is not a court case . This is not a crime in which there’s one victim and one perpetrator . We’re talking about attitudes in the world that involve , uh , hundreds of , of millions or billions of people . </s>
And there are many causative factors . And I don’t know what it is about the word fueling that you don’t understand . But the question here is whether Hollywood is one of those factors . And the very simple , uh , uh , you , answer to your effort to put this all on Iraq is that there was a lot of anti-Americanism in the world , uh , before the war in Iraq . There was a lot of anti-Americanism in the world before Bush was elected President . </s>
There was a Gallop poll , uh , of the Muslim world , taken , uh , a year before the war in Iraq , that – but after the war in Afghanistan , in which larger numbers of the respondents , uh , said they thought that , uh , that 9/11 , the attack , the terrorist act of 9/11 , was justified , than thought that our attack on the Al Qaeda and Taliban in Afghanistan , uh , was justified . And you can go back , uh , uh , to the Nineties when we were discussing enlarging NATO and there was a huge , uh , uh , outpouring of , uh , of , uh , anti-Americanism in Europe , afraid that the perpetuation of , of , uh , of NATO would be , as the French Foreign Minister put it , a Trojan horse to , to keep the Americans in control , uh , of NATO . </s>
This anti- Americanism comes from many reasons . It comes from some policies that we may think are wrong or , or Iraq or what have you . It comes from other policies that fewer people , uh , in this room would disagree with , as this gentleman pointed out , uh , from our support for Israel . Uh , I spend , uh , a lot of time in the Middle East . </s>
And when you talk to Middle Easterners they have two grievances against America at this moment and the war in Iraq is number two . It’s our support for Israel that’s , uh , that’s number one . And , uh , the , the issue of , uh , the fact is that we’re not going to be able to conduct ourselves in the world according to any policies without making some people angry , some people dislike us and so on . </s>
The question that we’re talking about tonight is whether the fare that Michael Moore and Oliver Stone and , uh , the , the other , uh , uh , Hollywood opinion shapers are putting out to the world , uh , contributes to and compounds that . The , the , yeah . Well , let me respond . First of all , you did see the sentence here . I know you did not intentionally leave it out – which is clearly marked , “Sample is weighed to be representative of the general population . </s>
“ So you’re not just quoting the first – Let me finish . No , I understand that it says that . </s>
But look at the percentages . So you’re not just quoting – So I understand -- But look at the percentages . Okay , but it says that . </s>
You got the percentages from here and it says , We know the percentages are too large and like good statisticians did , we adjusted for it . </s>
But let me go back to the substantive point , cause you’re just wrong on that one . The substantive point is , I think , goes back to what Bernie said . </s>
Yes , Michael Moore has three best selling books in Germany . But it doesn’t compare to The Titanic , Star Wars , E.T. , Pirates…and Lord of the Rings . It’s not even close . And how do we make the case that those movies that are loved around the world , they’re embraced around the world , that people fight to get in and see around the world – how do we say that is fueling anti-Americanism ? </s>
And , and your – We don’t . Nobody says that . And , and your question is – and what we’re saying is – </s>
So you’re agreeing with us . </s>
Thank you . No , Hollywood is not a factor , is not a significant factor . Yes , there are many reasons . I mean , it could be the proliferation of trans fats across the world . There are many reasons . </s>
But Hollywood is not the most significant reason why anti- Americanism is growing around the world . </s>
All right , let’s get some questions . Um , uh , uh , yes sir . Hi . </s>
Uh , I have a question for James Hirsen and , uh , Dana Wolfe said I should identify myself as Robert Siegel of NPR . Okay . </s>
I’ll be actually hosting the radio , uh , broadcast of the debate . </s>
And my , my question is , in the schema between the , the heroic golden age of Hollywood and the modern cynical age that you’ve drawn , uh , where would the movies of Frank Capra fit ? </s>
That is , in It’s a Wonderful Life , uh , there’s the fact that a banker and real estate developer is clearly villainous and evil , even though we know in real life in the decades since that time – he’s , he’s been the more efficient actor in the economy who has prevailed over the sentimental profligate S & L , which is heroic . Was that , was that a movie that fanned anti-Americanism at the time by , uh , presenting business in a negative light , or for that matter , was Mr. Smith Goes to Washington , which made a great deal out of big time corruption -- a movie that fanned anti- Americanism ? Or are we more sensitive today than we were then to the images of us on the screen ? </s>
Okay , good question . </s>
I think it’s the degree of specialization that Hollywood has had in villainizing and demonizing the representatives of free enterprise . And why , and why do I even talk about free enterprise ? Because America in the world represents the greatest experiment in free enterprise in the history of man . I mean , Western civilization generally – and America specifically – is an aberration in human history . </s>
And part of the whole class warfare concept , really , is to make success something that you should feel guilty for . And you see this theme running through . And it , and it’s , and it becomes more prevalent when Oliver Stone names a character after a lizard . It becomes more prevalent when we have this series of movies where the plot line involves the evil corporation and the crusading worker or journalist , or single mother with a push-up bra . It , it , it’s the same pattern but what it does is , it takes away from a great part of this country . </s>
Instead of something that could be told which is sort of the entrepreneurial cowboys in this country , going back to the luminaries like Thomas Edison to national treasures like Steve Jobs . Who creates prosperity around the world through innovation that is fostered by a system that didn’t happen by accident . I think that that , that is a significant and more subtle point of anti-Americanism though I , I say it’s not exclusive to the period after the decline of the studio system in the sixties . But then again , Frank Capra also made films , a series of films called Why We Fight that were made specifically during a time of war to bolster our side and demoralize their side . Instead today , as we brought up with Syriana and other films of that elk , films are being made to bolster their side – and to demoralize our side . </s>
We have time for one more question , okay ? </s>
Uh , that gentleman over there . I 'm sorry . God um , lets make it , sorry , lets make it a woman . Okay , the lady over there . Five what ? </s>
Five men and one woman and every movie you’ve mentioned has been produced and directed by men . We are fifty percent of the population and I would appreciate us being represented . Okay , is there another question ? I want to answer that . If every movie I’ve mentioned was produced by a man , it just shows that women are not guilty for uh , for fueling anti-Americanism . </s>
Miss . </s>
I was just going to ask the same question that he did , only about the best years of our lives , the great movies from the thirties or forties , was it ? Right . </s>
I mean , what has been the change ? What’s changed since then that’s made our attitudes so completely different ? And the , the short word is the 1960s . </s>
I mean why is it that today you can never hear the word corporation ? This is now , it’s , it’s synonymous with evil . And if you prefix the word corporation with multinational , it becomes kind of the , the epitome of all evil . </s>
Why is that ? I mean sure there were plenty of movies in the past that may have represented this or that businessman , this or that politician as corrupt or evil , but now it’s always the case . </s>
I mean some of my colleagues mentioned movies that , where they’ve changed the plot . I mean , and I’ll just mention one more , The Bourne Identity . In the book , the bad guy was Carlos the Jackal . In the movie , it’s the CIA and this is consistent . </s>
I mean it’s just every kind of thriller that you see these days uh , the United States government , the United States military , the United States commercial enterprise . It’s always presented as somehow corrupt , venal , savage . Alright we have one more question from this gentleman – . Obviously artists always have an obligation to their countries , but are you really going to sit here and compare Frank Capra’s obligation to an America that had been attacked at Pearl Harbor and was threatened by a Nazi menace with the obligation of an artist today who’s facing a war that was effectively picked and is uh , demonstrably going nowhere during the same time frame that it took to win all of World War II ? </s>
Well actually I , I think that um we now face um , a , a faux that is maybe the most dangerous we have faced since the Battle of Leponto . I guess he wants you to answer that . It’s time folks . And now um , ladies and gentlemen , it’s now time to vote . And – . </s>
We vote and as they vote , you do closing . Is that correct ? MAN Yeah , don’t vote yet . </s>
As you vote , as they vote , you have your closing , okay ? That’s the rule . </s>
So um , it’s time to vote . So um , if you want to vote for the motion , tear off “For” from the top , from the top , and put it in the ballot boxes that are going around . </s>
If you 're against , tear off “Against” and put it in the ballot box . If you 're , um , undecided , put in the whole thing . If you need a voting ticket , the ushers will give it to you . </s>
Uh , and while we’re doing this , uh , we’re having final remarks from the panelists . Beginning with a side opposing the motion , the first person who’s going to speak will be Robert Walter . Richard Walter . </s>
I 'm sorry , Richard Walter . I 'm sorry , Richard Walter . Now Hollywood takes on corporations because it’s David and Goliath . I have nothing against the corporations , I 'm a free enterprise capitalist myself . </s>
And um , the reason they uh , these , these stories treat them the way they do is because it’s the little guy versus the , versus the big guy . Nothing new about it at all . You know American film is world film . Films made outside the United States , only one in ten will be shown outside the country of its origin , but all American films are shown outside the country of their origin . </s>
Some as you know are , are shown only outside the country of their origin . </s>
That is to say , they can’t win domestic distribution deals and instead are released on cable and direct to video . </s>
What can explain this ? The answer is the quality of American film and I also I believe the diversity of American films , the immigrant heritage of the American uh , nation and of the American film business in particular . When you look at American films , you’re looking at the world because you 're seeing people of every race , of every creed , of every persuasion . American films are the single biggest export in the nation . </s>
They contribute more affirmatively to the reduction of the unfavorable balance of trade . They are a blessing upon us and should be celebrated by people who really love this country , who really consider them to be patriotic , rather than constantly besmirching them and caviling about them . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Okay , for , Roger Kimball . </s>
Well I remember when I was in uh , high school . My Jesuit teachers would drum various things into us . And one saying they had was “Never deny , seldom affirm , always distinguish.” It pains me to observe that the speakers against this motion tonight seem to be unable to appreciate that the motion does not say that Hollywood causes anti-Americanism . </s>
It is not a referendum on the Bush administration or the war in Iraq . It simply says that Hollywood fuels anti-Americanism abroad . It seems to me that um , my team has supplied numerous examples of how this , how this happens . And we could certainly spend the entire night providing examples . One of the people on the opposing side remarked on the remarkable outpouring sympathy for the United States in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 . </s>
Well I , I would , and then its quick evaporation . Um I would say that that outpouring of sympathy was basically a version of sentimentality lodged upon the United States in its you know , unusual posture as victim . As soon as the United States began standing up for itself , that sympathy vanished . And I think that tells us a lot about the world opinion and how we can depend upon it . But in terms of Hollywood which is really a mindset , as James Hirsen said , it’s not just the movies . </s>
It’s really , we’re talking about a way of looking at the world , pop culture in general . I think this is a mindset that has given up on America in many ways , given up on those traditional virtues . James mentioned free enterprise but there are many other things . Individual liberty , belief in the , in the future , really . And – </s>
Roger . Done ? I will finish then , or stop . Okay uh , against , Robin . </s>
Um I guess the only thing I can say is that if American movies uh , bred anti-American sentiment , I 'm not sure why Iran and North Korea don’t have compulsory Sunday matinees . Uh , okay , for . Joshua Muravchick . Uh , in her earlier remarks , Robin said that there’s no scientific proof , no reliable study that Hollywood is responsible for encouraging anti-American sentiment . </s>
That is absolutely true . There’s also no reliable study , no proof that any other factor whatsoever causes anti-Americanism . We have this phenomenon of anti-Americanism . There are many things that contribute to it . </s>
And uh , we , we don’t have any science of anti-Americanism to tell us exactly which . I think common sense tells us that some , the kind of work of someone like Michael Moore which is so tremendously popular in Europe contributes to that . </s>
And when we have Robert talk about that house in moment after 9/11 when the world all loved us , uh , that moment was symbolized by a headline in Le Monde . Which translated , said “We are all Americans now.” And that was repeated here many times . However if you get Le Monde and read the essay , the essay was brimming with anti-Americanism , saying you know this attack is a terrible thing but it’s what the Americans deserved for the way they attempt to dominate the world . </s>
Uh , and as for the likes of , of uh , Oliver Stone , I’d just like to share with you an anecdote . Last year , I had the opportunity to attend a conference in Ramallah . </s>
I was one of only two Americans there . There were hundreds of Palestinians talking among themselves . And one , Hani al-Hassan , who had been a member of Arafat’s cabinet , gave the sort of keynote address , a history of the Arab-Israel conflict . </s>
And he said , in the early 1960s , President Yasser wanted to end the conflict with Israel so he sent a letter to President Kennedy telling him how that could be done . President Kennedy sent him back a letter saying , yes I agree , and this was all about to be consummated when the Zionists assassinated Kennedy . And uh , I sat there stunned in my seat , but how would I explain to young Palestinians who have seen the , the likes of Oliver Stone’s uh , paranoid fantasies about what happened to Kennedy , uh , that uh , Hani al-Hassan’s uh , it’s just implausible . </s>
Joshua . Thanks very much . Against , Robert Greenwald . </s>
Well it’s slightly off subject , but I want to know why Josh was one of only two Americans at this conference . Now I am scared for our country and the impression they get , and have somebody over there who advocated for the war and wants us to bomb Iran . But going back to the primary subject , lets not confuse bad movies or even critical movies . The assumption here is , if it’s a movie critical of something in the United States , therefore that will fuel anti-Americans . Not true , not accurate . </s>
To use Jo- , to use Josh’s words , common sense can tell us that many people all over the world and many people here have seen movies that are critical . That does not turn you into anti-American . And I would argue that the movies , the popular movies , the ones that are being seen in overwhelming numbers , as Bernie helpfully provided this list , far outweigh – and if we go back to the , the woman’s question about fueling , you know I do n't want to get into technical what is fuel and what’s not fuel . But lets say for a moment , Titanic , Star Wars , E.T. , that’s building tremendous goodwill which would and therefore there would be no fuel for the couple of incidents which might possibly , on a given day , encourage somebody to be against us . </s>
Thank you . And for , James Hirsen . </s>
Please . Um - </s>
James Hirsen . </s>
Yeah I mentioned uh , you know I , I live close to Los Angeles and I love Hollywood , but I love America more . And uh , I’ll tell you , Richard Dreyfuss , who used to speak differently about America until he went on a campaign to teach civics and he read some himself , has called this country a miracle . And the innovations and advancements that we’ve had here were because of a system where for the very first time , rights and powers were viewed as implanted in individuals . And some of those were transferred , pursuant to a social contract we call the Constitution , to a government . </s>
That had never happened before . Um this motion is , is about free speech . </s>
And uh , to address an audience member who asked about responsibility today , the responsibility is greater for two reasons . One is because of what Thomas Freedman calls the flat earth . Because Hollywood exports more instantly , and two is because of the greater war . We were attacked in the city , it was the greatest attack on continental soil in our history . </s>
The greater war continues , even many of those who opposed the war in Iraq are still cognizant of the fact that there is a war on terror . The reason I , I had asked you to vote for the motion was simply to raise awareness that this output of pop culture coming out of Hollywood matters . And it’s not only for our domestic consumption , it’s being consumed by the world , it shapes the way they view us . And Hollywood ought to use its power to help America prosper . </s>
I mean in that way , in the world’s eyes , they’d be a winner . </s>
Well I , I want to thank the debaters and the audience for their good work . And before I announce the results of the audience voting , I want to take care of a few things . I would like to invite you all to return next year for the Fifth Intelligence Squared US Debate on Wednesday , February 7 here at the Asia Society . </s>
The motion to be debated is “America is too damn religious.” The debate will be moderated by the co-director of the Fordham Center on Religion and Culture and The New York Times columnist , Peter Steinfels . An edited version of tonight’s Intelligence Squared US Debate can be heard locally on WNYC AM , AM820 on Friday , December 22nd at 2PM . Copies of James Hirsen’s Hollywood Nation : Left Coast Lies , Old Media Spin , and New Media Revolution , Roger Kimball’s books , The Long March and The Rape of the Masters , and Richard Walter’s Screenwriting : The Art , Craft , and Business of Film and Television Writing , are for sale upstairs in the lobby . Finally after the debate , please be sure to pick up a copy of tomorrow’s edition of The Times of London , along with a special subscription offer for IQ2 US patrons . </s>
And now the results of the debate . </s>
After the debaters did their best to sway you and the question was , Hollywood has fueled anti- Americanism abroad , you voted thirty-five percent for the motion , fifty-nine percent against the motion – . And six percent don’t , did not know . Which means that those against the motion carried the day . MAN Turned it around too . </s>
Congratulations . And congratulations to everybody and thanks very much , thank you . And now I 'd like to introduce the chairman of Intelligence Squared , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Thank you and welcome . Well , I do n't mean to be a name dropper , but last week I posed our resolution to two of my dinner partners , Rupert Murdoch and George W. Bush . </s>
They both had strong views , and both were against the motion . Murdoch was vehement that FOX News is not polarizing , but presents -- -- but presents a more balanced view than the other networks and attracts an audience that is 40 percent Democrat , which I thought was an interesting statistic . And President Bush argued that in most of the world , the internet has opened minds to the way of life in the liberal democracies and has been a hugely constructive force for change . He acknowledged the extreme polarization of American politics , but blamed it on the class warfare rhetoric of his successor . </s>
Whenever one thinks of their points , they do illuminate some of the subtleties in the language of our resolution . Murdoch correctly grasped that it does not posit that the internet is the sole or even the primary driver of the narrow ideologies that seem to dominate politics . Rather , he understood the internet as part of a broader trend toward a highly fragmented media . </s>
And President Bush , by taking the resolution in a global context , prompts me to clarify that what we expect to talk about tonight is American politics . </s>
Why might be the internet be closing our minds ? The first reason is that the internet makes it very easy to tailor the information we get to conform to a preconceived world view . </s>
We can choose news aggregators on the left or on the right , not to mention highly ideological bloggers and live our lives without encountering any contrary opinion . In a great little essay called , `` Why Groups Go to Extremes , '' Cass Sunstein , the Obama administration 's regulatory czar , demonstrated empirically that discussing issues with like-minded folks tends to make positions more extreme . In addition to self selection , the internet makes it easy for websites to , `` personalize our offerings . '' It seems innocuous , even helpful when Netflix tells us that the viewers who enjoyed movie A also enjoyed movie B . But if you Google federal deficit or Medicare reform , is it healthy for your search to come up differently than mine based on what Google has been able to infer about our political leanings ? </s>
Those against the motion will argue that the internet is a vast information utility which facilitates search , learning and communications . </s>
Personalization may be a blessing , simply helping us make the choices we want to make . We can turn personal filters on or off , so there 's no real danger here . And little hard evidence that Google has helped us erect mental fortresses through which contrary ideas are not allowed to penetrate . </s>
Indeed , the filters from the pre-internet era , three like-minded networks and a handful of local newspapers , were arguably less hospitable to views outside American census than the open marketplace and information and ideas we have today . To illuminate the complexities here , we have four distinguished experts , and it 's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator , John Donvan . </s>
Thank you , Robert . </s>
Thank you . </s>
And I would just like to invite one more round of applause for the benefactor of this series , Robert Rosenkranz . Yes or no to this statement : `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' </s>
The state of the online debate , that is what we 're debating here tonight . Welcome from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan . We have four superbly qualified debaters , two against two . </s>
And what we 're touching on here -- well , it starts with this , a sampling of this , and see if it 's familiar . This is a recent exchange among Wall Street Journal readers who were posting to each other about health care or actually posting at each other . Glen , the liberal , just had his argument attacked by David , the conservative . Glen gets mad . </s>
“One wonders how you can even press the keys on the keyboard . Please just go away . '' David responds , `` Now I know you 're a liberal because liberals are rude and will not listen to any reason . '' A guy named Kevin joins in the attack , and he tells Glen to read up on economics and civics . </s>
Glen tells Kevin , `` Put this in your pipe and smoke it , you pseudo intellectual rube . '' From nowhere , a guy named Mark weighs in . </s>
He tells Glen that he is `` intellectually challenged” and advises him that he needs to “get some lithium . '' </s>
When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . </s>
Is that what we just heard , our minds closing out there , or is it a great thing that these guys are actually out there engaging with each other at all ? Our debate goes in three rounds , then the audience votes to choose the winner . </s>
Only one side wins . </s>
On the side for our motion , when it comes to politics , the internet is changing our minds , Eli Pariser , a board member and former executive director of MoveOn.org . His partner is Siva Vaidhyanathan , professor and chair of the Department of Media Studies at the University of Virginia . Arguing against the motion that when it comes to politics , the internet is changing our minds , Evgeny Morozov , a Schwartz fellow at the New America Foundation and author of `` The Net Delusion . '' And his partner , Jacob Weisberg , chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group . Our motion is , `` When it comes to politics , the Internet is closing our minds . '' </s>
Let 's meet our debaters now and welcome first Eli Pariser . </s>
And Eli , at the age of 20 , you joined MoveOn.org to direct its foreign policy campaigns . And then a couple of years later , you became its executive director . You have been an online organizer all of your adult life . </s>
But now you are warning about the dangers of the internet . So what changed , you or the internet ? The internet changed more than I did . All right . </s>
We 'll see when you -- when you get up there , we 're going to see what you mean by that . Your debating partner , let 's welcome Siva Vaidhyanathan . Siva , you are a professor and Department of Media Studies chair at the University of Virginia . </s>
You 're also author of this book , `` The Googlization of Everything and Why We Should Worry . '' This is actually your second debate with us . </s>
And the first time you were debating for the motion , `` Google violates its do n't be evil motto , '' and you won . Do you still think -- do you still think Google is evil ? Well , I never thought Google was evil , but I did think that was an impossible standard for any company to hold , so it was actually not that hard to win . </s>
I think the really interesting question is , does Google think I 'm evil . </s>
Thank you . Our motion is , `` When it comes to politics , the Internet is closing our minds . '' Let 's meet the team arguing against . First , Evgeny Morozov . You 're a visiting fellow at Stanford University , a Schwartz fellow at the New America Foundation . </s>
You wrote a book also , `` The Net Delusion : The Dark Side of Internet Freedom . '' You have said -- this was in a TED talk , that when the internet reaches a remote Russian village , people are not going to be sitting there watching reports from Human Rights Watch ; they 're going to be watching pornography , Sex and the City or maybe funny videos of cats . </s>
So how worried are you about these cat videos ? Well , cats , I think are the new opium of the masses . And the the have figured it out , and they exploit perfectly a little thought control . Thank you . </s>
And let 's meet your debating partner , Jacob Weisberg . Jacob , you are chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group . </s>
Now , you wrote for print , for everybody in the old days , the New Republic , New York Magazine , Financial Times among other places . </s>
But in 1996 , you joined a new online magazine called Slate as its chief political correspondent . </s>
That was very early in the game . So what did you know back then ? </s>
Well , John , I was an early visionary . No , actually , I got very lucky when my friend , Michael Kinsley decided to found Slate , and it seemed like a fun thing to do . And it turns out it 's impossible to go back . The internet spoils you as a writer because of the freedom you have and the speed . </s>
All right . </s>
Thank you , Jacob Weisberg . </s>
Our four debaters , ladies and gentlemen . Now , in this debate , you , our audience , are our judges . By the time the debate has ended , we 're going to have asked you to vote two times , once before the debate and once again after the debate on the language motion and on your position on it both before and after . And what we want to ask you to do now is go to the key pads at your seat . </s>
On the right hand side , you 'll see a keypad . And we 'll ask you to vote your sentiment on this motion as you 're coming off the street . </s>
Our motion is , `` When it comes to politics , the Internet is closing our minds . '' If you agree with it , push number one . If you disagree , push number two . </s>
If you 're undecided , push number three . And you can ignore the other keys . And if you want to correct your entry , just correct it , and the system will register your last vote . So that 's locked out now . Again , at the end of the debate , we 're going to ask you to vote on the quality of the arguments that were presented here tonight , and the team that has the greatest differential between this opening vote and the closing vote will be declared by you , our audience , their winners . </s>
So we go in three rounds . The first round is seven minutes , each , uninterrupted by each speaker in turn . So on to round one , opening statements from each of our debaters , and going up first for our motion , which is , `` When it comes to politics , the Internet is closing our minds , '' Eli Pariser . </s>
He 's a MoveOn.org board member , CEO of Upworthy.com , and author of , `` The Filter Bubble , What the Internet is Hiding from You . '' </s>
That book was the inspiration for our having this debate tonight . Ladies and gentlemen , Eli Pariser . Good evening , everyone . I find myself arguing that the Internet is closing our minds with a bit of regret . This is n't the place that I would want to be , and actually as of a few years ago I would have been arguing the other side , but I 've come to believe that the -- well , the Internet is incredibly good at getting groups of likeminded people to get together , think together , work together . </s>
But it 's actually quite bad at bridging between groups of different people , and that the view that the Internet is exposing us to all sorts of new ways of thinking and new ideas is kind of a dated view , that the Internet 's changing , and that there are a few big companies that would like us to hold onto that idea that the Internet is still this kind of open place . So the core of my argument is this , attention is the most valuable commodity out there right now . If you command attention , then you can direct it towards products or services and you can make a lot of money , and that 's why all of the big companies on the Internet are trying to figure out what the best strategy is for gathering as much of it as possible . </s>
And most of them are focused on the same strategy which is gathering as much data about us as they can and then using that data to give us what they think , what they predict , based on their -- this data and their algorithms , we 're going to be interested in . Relevance is the big watchword here . So , you know , if you talk to these companies , if you look at what they 're saying , it 's very clear that this is a big part of the business plan . Eric Schmidt says , `` Very soon it will be nearly impossible to see something that has not in some way been tailored to you . '' </s>
Sheryl Sandberg of Facebook , says , `` Within the next few years , it 'll be anachronistic to visit a website that has n't been customized to your personal interests in some way . '' And Facebook is becoming this growing source of how people get their news and how people get their information . </s>
So why are they doing this ? Well , I think Evgeny actually put it really well . Why does Facebook employ filters ? The more they know about us , the more they can make in advertising revenues . And the thing is that these companies are n't blind to the psychology of all this . </s>
They 've read all of the studies that show that when you present people with information that confirms what they already believed was true , you can actually see these little bursts of pleasure happening in people 's brains . And conversely , when people are presented with information that challenges what they believed , they get cranky . That 's just the way we 're wired . And so if you 're a company that 's trying to meet stockholder demands and you have this power to present people with information that tends to validate them , why would n't you ? </s>
As a result of this kind of personalization and self selection , we 're more likely to see things we agree with and less likely to see things we disagree with . Now , to be clear , I 'm not arguing that all personalization is bad . </s>
Personalization certainly can have benefits . I 'm a Netflix user . But the question is , what are the driving motives behind the kind of personalization that most people use , and what are the effects of that personalization ? And I 'll argue that because of the motives of these companies , those filters that they 're building are going to tend to surround us with information that 's agreeable to us and not with information that 's uncomfortable . </s>
So a few examples of what this looks like in practice , it looks like one person googling Egypt and seeing lots of information about the Arab Spring and another person googling Egypt at the same time and seeing nothing about the Arab Spring . This actually happened , I 've got the screenshots on my website . And , you know , I could run through a number of other anecdotes , but actually there 's been a study -- the only peer reviewed study I 'm aware of on the Google search results and the effects of personalization there -- that shows that 60 percent of the search results on a given front page are usually personalized . </s>
Either they 're in a different order or they 're actually , you know , totally different results based on who Google thinks you are and what it thinks you 'll be interested in . So what I think we have to begin to do is to tease apart what the Internet actually does from what we wish it would do or what it possibly could do . And in particular we have to tease apart what 's possible to access versus what people do access . For example , now that the -- it 's easy now to access the front page of Le Monde or Die Zeit , as it is , in fact to access the New York Times . So you would think , given this vast increase in accessibility of foreign policy , information , of what’s going on in other countries , that people would know more about what’s going on there . </s>
In fact that’s not true . According to a Pew study from 2007 , people actually were more informed on foreign policy matters before the internet than in 2007 . </s>
So when Jacob says you can find more sources than ever , it’s kind of beside the point . What’s relevant is that people come into daily contact more frequently , is whether people come into daily contact with more different sources and more particular , different ideological ones . I agree here again with Evgeny who says the regular folk don’t read sites like Global Voices , an aggregator of the most interesting blog posts from all over the world . Instead they are more likely to use the internet to rediscover their own culture and dare we say it , their own national bigotry . So to summarize , big companies are rapidly working to personalize your version of the web . </s>
They want to show you what they think you’re going to be interested in . And this is n't passive . This isn’t me turning on Fox News or me turning on -- or picking up a copy of the Nation . This is embedded in an increasing number of websites . Yahoo News in 2007 , was a gateway for 80 million people that looked the same . </s>
But now , Yahoo runs 13 million different variations of Yahoo News front page every day . And they’re different for each person . It’s hard to even see . We don’t know how tailored our view of the web is because you have to sit down next to someone else and look at the differences . </s>
So the object of this personalization is to get us to click more . It’s to get us to like more . And importantly , it’s to get us to click on ads . And there’s little benefit in that world to presenting us with information that makes us uncomfortable , that challenges our views , or that makes us think differently . </s>
I don’t think that this has caused the extreme political polarization that we’re seeing right now . But I think it can’t help but exacerbate it . Google says that it’s trying to provide relevance . But what is the most relevant search result when you’re a 9/11 conspiracy theorist googling 9/11 ? </s>
Is it the conspiracy links that Google’s algorithm would tend to promote or is it the Popular Mechanics article that would debunk that stuff ? I asked Google this question and they didn’t really have a clear answer . So it’s with regret that I think the Internet is not living up to its potential . The way that most people actually use the thing isn’t to broaden their political perspectives . </s>
In fact the path that we generally travel on online will tend to mirror our political views . Thank you . Thank you Eli Pariser . Our motion is `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' And here to speak against the motion , Jacob Weisberg . </s>
He is a pioneer in online journalism . Jacob is editor in chief of the Slate Group , the internet based arm of the Washington Post Company . Thank you John . </s>
Eli , you can’t have Evgeny . He’s committed to me till at least 8:15 . Look , I’ll concede that the internet narrowing our political perspectives is an interesting theoretical problem . People do have a tendency to prefer listening to what they already agree with . </s>
And the internet makes it easier in theory for people to live in a solid cystic bubble , where they mostly interact with people who have similar views . </s>
But is that a phenomenon that’s getting worse ? </s>
And if it is getting worse , is it getting worse because of the internet ? Eli , and I think Siva , is going to argue that because , they think that because Google and Facebook are bad for us , it must be . But their skepticism about these tools we use every day is kind of the mirror opposite of the cyber utopians who think that new technology only brings us good things . </s>
There are a lot of interesting theoretical problems from the Malthusian food scarcity to the Y2K bug , that are just never born out in practice . The Atlantic Magazine gets a cover out of this every month right ? Is Google making you stupid ? </s>
Is Facebook making you lonely ? </s>
That’s actually the cover this month . Is Twitter destroying your attention span ? </s>
But cyber realists like Evgeny and me try to look at questions like this in a more empirical way . So what’s the evidence for tonight’s proposition , the internet is narrowing our views . </s>
I won’t say there’s none , but I will say it’s laughably weak . And there’s some really good evidence that the web’s doing the opposite of what our opponents claim , that it’s exposing us to a broader range of perspectives and making us less parochial in our outlook . And it’s on that empirical basis and on the basis of your own experience of not becoming more narrow , that you should vote against tonight’s motion . </s>
There’s of course some studies about this . There was one a few years ago that showed left and right wing bloggers don’t just talk to their own side . They respond to each other and link to each other a lot , and it’s not all the kind of exchange John cited at the beginning . There 's a Pew study from last year that show -- this is a quote , `` No evidence that social network users , including those who use Facebook , were any more likely to cocoon themselves in social networks of like minded and similar people as some have feared . '' </s>
There 's another new Pew study that says that people 's social network friendships tend to cross political boundaries . The biggest study which involved 250 million Facebook users , yes , it was sponsored by Facebook , but it was a good study , showed convincingly that most people share links from people they are n't close to . That is , we do reach outside of our personal circles for news . </s>
So Eli said at the beginning of his very interesting book that he published last year , that `` Google was tailoring search results to our politics . '' He said that on the basis of one anecdote from a friend I do n't think he named . He had a similar anecdote tonight about Egypt . </s>
Allow me to be skeptical . You can get -- you can do a funky search that gives you weird results at any time of the day for a variety of reasons . But I did a test on this where I asked friends of mine , different parts of the country , different political views , different worlds , to search some parallel , very political loaded terms like `` climate change . '' And basically , they got exactly the same thing . </s>
And I do n't think that there is more than anecdotes to support what Eli is talking about . I 've looked at the studies . </s>
Now , since Eli wrote his book , Google has changed , and it now includes results from your social network and search returns . </s>
So if you 're spending all your time on Google Plus , and you 're the only people in your circle or Bill O'Reilly and Rush Limbaugh , you may in fact see some ideological bias in the returns . But Google added social searching in a way that actually specifically addresses Eli 's problem . He had a lot of influence on this . You can turn customization off by pressing the prominent button that says , `` Hide personal results . '' And you can toggle back and forth if you 're curious about the difference . </s>
On Facebook , it 's just as easy to turn off customization . You change the sort option on your top stories to most recent . In other words , the filtering they do , these giant sites , is completely transparent and optional . I leave customization on most of the time because a social filter does n't actually trap you in your own bubble . </s>
And take music just as an example I think we can all relate to . The reason I use Spotify , which is a social music service , is that I 'm a little bored with the music I already know , and I want to be exposed to stuff I do n't know , which I get through my Facebook friends . So back at the level of theory , could an algorithm personalize the news to figure your -- your political perspective ? I think it 's much harder to do that than it seems . News organizations are really trying to do that . </s>
They actually have n't been very successful , which is why , when you go to newyorktimes.com , and I go , we get the same home page . Of course , you can get narrow minded , politically filtered news , but you do n't need the internet to do that . You can go to Rush Limbaugh and the radio or FOX or MSNBC on TV . </s>
Now , it is worth noting that we did used to have the kind of constricting filter bubble Eli 's worried about . And that was the mainstream media before the internet . When I was a kid in the '70s , you found out about the world through TV networks , a couple of news magazines , local newspapers . There were n't any national ones . </s>
And it was a very limited range of viewpoints and voices . And if you want to create that kind of filter bubble , all you have to do is remove technologies before television , before radio , before newspapers . </s>
So personally , I get a lot of my news these days through a tool called Twitter . I use it as a filter for stories that are relevant to me . </s>
And what it does is the opposite of narrowing my perspective . Thanks to Twitter , I 'm regularly getting news from global sources as well as American ones . I tune into a lot of really interesting Arab voices during the Arab Spring . </s>
I followed China in part through an English translation of Tweets from Ai Weiwei the Chinese artist who 's become one of the most important dissidents in the world today . </s>
And those filters broaden my perspective . </s>
Twitter is a serendipity engine . Finally , I do n't think you need to look at all these studies or understand algorithms to make up your mind about tonight 's motion . All you have to do is ask yourself a pretty simple question : Has the web narrowed my mind ? Has it made me less tolerant of people I disagree with and less interested in what they have today to say ? Or has it exposed me to a broader range of voices , sources and ideas than we all used to get when we relied on a consensus oriented mainstream media for all our information ? </s>
Unless you 're convinced that the web makes you narrower , you should vote against tonight 's motion . Thank you , Jacob Weisberg . A reminder of what 's going on . </s>
We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan . We have four debaters , two teams of two fighting it out over this motion , `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' We have heard the first opening statements , and now onto the third . </s>
Debating for the motion , the author of `` The Googlization of Everything and Why We Should Worry , '' chair of the University of Virginia 's Department of Media Studies . He 's been called `` Google 's gadfly , '' Siva Vaidhyanathan . Thank you . So the internet has so narrowed my mind that I did n't hear a word Jacob said . </s>
So in these brief comments , I will explain what Eli and I mean by the internet as invoked in the resolution and what we mean by politics . And I 'm going to convince you to support the resolution . First , try to remember 1999 , the days of AOL , the days of Prodigy , the apex of our long national nightmare of peace and prosperity . In 1999 , Thomas Friedman wrote these words : `` the internet is going to be like a huge vise . It 's going to keep tightening and tightening that system” -- meaning the system of globalization -- `` around everyone in ways that will only make the world smaller , smaller and faster and faster . '' </s>
Well , Thomas Friedman could not have been more wrong . </s>
He 's been exactly that wrong many times , but never more wrong . Now , in 2012 , it 's clear that there is no such thing as `` The Internet , ” capital T , capital I as Friedman and others so often described in the 1990s . There is no equalizing force , great democratizing force , there is no global network of networks that unites us all and gives us all equal voice to interact with each other across borders and across classes , for that matter . In fact , the alleged network of networks is , in 2012 , balkanized , nationalized , compromised , anesthetized , supervised , circumcised and hypnotized . </s>
It 's far from global , and it 's getting less so every day . The online experience of a person sitting in Turkey is so different from the online experience of someone sitting in India and so different from the online experience of someone sitting in Iran or someone sitting in China . And all of those are even more different from the experiences of people in Brazil , in Russia or the United States . And we 're talking about more than censorship , although , in many of those countries , online censorship is a serious and crippling issue . We 're also talking about platforms , the platforms that people use , the platforms that governments will let people use . </s>
The rise of kill switches is something we have to take into account as well . Kill switches that we saw a year ago in Egypt to wipe out internet communication in an instant , we 've seen experiments in kill switches in China in early 2012 , and we 've seen people like Senator Lieberman even propose them in the United States . </s>
Internet technologies amplify so much of what we already are and what we already want . And the fact is , we 're pretty provincial animals . So add the internet to it , we just double down . We get more provincial . Platforms matter , defaults matter , and policies matter . </s>
So here in 2012 , or now in 2012 , we are not all holding virtual hands with our Facebook friends across the globe singing , `` We are the world . '' There is no coordinated global movement for justice . There 's no sophisticated online debate about our collective human state or even our basic human needs . </s>
The dominant powers governing our digital experiences , the state , for instance , in China , or corporations in Brazil or the United States are not interested in such matters . They are not interested in us being political . Sometimes these powers actively restrict us , like in China . More often than not , these powers seduce us into shallow consumption , consumptive behaviors like shopping or giggling at cats or clicking on cows . </s>
Not that there 's anything wrong with clicking on virtual cows , but it ai n't political . Our minds are closing because our attentions are distracted , fractured and segregated into niches and nations . But all hope is not lost . </s>
There is nothing about the nature of the internet that prevents us from being political , richly political . Many of us actually are , I would suspect that most of us in the audience have done a pretty good job of avoiding these traps . </s>
We 're pretty elite . We 're pretty aware . And we 're pretty connected . And we route around a lot of these problems . </s>
We 're also hungry for information . If you were n't hungry , you would n't be here . So many of us , despite what Facebook does with thoughts , despite what the Iranian government does in Iran , have managed to be richly political . But we do know that the internet by itself does not topple dictators , does not undermine newspapers . It 's just not that simple . </s>
If we recognized the biases inherent in many of the platforms of our media systems , we can correct , we can adjust , we can invest , we can invent , we can resist , persist , and thrive . We could build platforms that enhance Republican deliberation and extend cosmopolitan perspectives . </s>
We just have n't done that yet . </s>
We 've been really busy clicking on cows . </s>
But all that takes work . It takes real human work in addition to invention and imagination , real human effort . But the first step to recognizing that -- I 'm sorry -- the first step to realizing that is to recognize what 's happening . </s>
When it comes to politics , the Internet , most importantly how we experience the Internet is closing our minds one cow click at a time . </s>
Please vote for the motion . Thanks . Thank you . </s>
Our motion is , `` When it comes to politics , the Internet is closing our minds . '' </s>
And our final debater against the motion , he comes from the former Soviet Republic of Belarus , something that has shaped his interest in the Internet 's role in politics , he is a Schwartz Fellow at the New American Foundation , and author of the book , `` The Net Delusion , '' Evgeny Morozov . Thank you . Well , I 'm glad that Siva has chosen to debate with Thomas Friedman rather than with us , but I 'd like to begin with a few lessons from history . First , technology always plays the scapegoat whenever it comes to debates about the closing of the American mind . </s>
Remember Allan Bloom and his bestselling book , `` The Closing of the American Mind , '' in the '80s ? Well , let me remind you , Bloom has actually argued that the closing of the American mind occurs because of CD players and headphones . </s>
And he actually argued that those might incite teenagers to kill their parents . We know what the late Allan Bloom would have made of the iPad , why his reactionary torch is now being carried by the liberal crowd from MoveOn is beyond me . The second lesson from history is that concerns about online polarization are as old as the . As early as 1995 , the Nation Magazine carried an article by Andrew Shapiro , which argued , and I quote , `` Cyberspace is shaping out to be more like suburbia than cy-Berkeley , where you interact only with people of your choosing and with information tailored to your desires . '' </s>
That was 1995 . Six years later , Cass Sunstein argued that , `` The Internet is serving as a breeding ground for extremism because likeminded people are deliberating with one another without hearing contrary views , '' end of quote . So enter Eli Pariser . In one respect , he follows in the tradition of Shapiro and Sunstein . </s>
All of them present virtually no evidence that such online segregation is taking place . </s>
But they 're also different . Where Shapiro and Sunstein worried that we , the users , might choose the easy way out and simply award our comfortable viewpoints , but Pariser argues that filters and algorithms are doing this for us . It 's a very important difference . Shapiro and Sunstein blame the filter bubble on us , the users . But Pariser blames it on the companies . </s>
Now , who does n't like such an exciting conspiracy theory ? After all , it 's always good to find someone else to blame but us . I think this is a fairytale for many of the reasons that Jacob has outlined , but let me also provoke and give you three examples of how filters naturally enhance our political culture . So let 's take Twitter . </s>
Many people think that Twitter , unlike Google and Facebook , does not engage in customizing and filtering . That is actually not true . </s>
Twitter does hide certain types of messages . </s>
Thus , if you follow me but you do n't follow Siva , and I send Siva a public tweet , you will not see that tweet . Just think about it , you choose to follow me and you probably expect to get all of my messages , but you 're actually not seeing my tweet to Siva . And , mind you , Twitter made that filtering decision on your behalf . Is it paternalistic ? </s>
Sure . </s>
Are these types of paternalism justified ? Well , take my case . I follow more than 2,000 people on Twitter , and I 'm very happy with the breadth of news I get . But if I have to read every single conversation that these 2,000 people have with thousands of people that they know but I do n't know , I will have never managed to follow 2,000 people . At best , I would follow 100 . </s>
This is the beauty of it , Twitter 's filter allows me to access more , not less useful information . Now , let 's take Facebook . It has 800 million users . Some of them are heavy users , they have 5,000 friends and spend hours on it every day . </s>
Others open it every few weeks and only have a few dozen friends . So Facebook has built this very collaborative differentiation . If you are a heavy user , it presents you all updates from your friends in the chronological order . </s>
That’s the most recent updates from all your friends come first . However , if you only use it occasionally , they will show you only the most interesting updates . The assumption there is that if you have been away for three weeks and you only have 30 minutes to catch up , why go through thousands of messages in chronological order ? </s>
To Facebook and to me , this seems like a reasonable assumption . That’s why relevance rather than recency is the default filter for the occasional users . If you want to see all the recent messages , all you have to do , as Jacob said , is just click a button called most recent . </s>
Sure we can have a broad philosophical debate on whether social networking is good or evil , but as long as we accept that social networking is a legitimate activity , we should also accept that filters make it better . </s>
Now let’s tackle the elephant in the room , which is Google . Suppose I’m so keen on conspiracy theories that my blackboard is larger than Glenn Beck’s . So I believe that 9/11 was an inside job . I believe that Obama is a Kenya-born Muslim , that climate change is a non-issue manufactured by the lamestream media , that the government is hiding the truth about the UFOs and so on . In other words , I’m exactly the kind of guy that Eli is worried about . </s>
Furthermore , suppose that I became all of that before the filter bubble set in . In the great age of unfiltered viewpoints that we used to call the era of cable television . </s>
So now comes the filter bubble and Google starts personalizing my search results . </s>
Instead of seeing generic search results say about 9/11 , actually see that some search results have already been endorsed or liked by my friends . </s>
In turn , when my friends use Google , they see the links that I visited and I liked as well . Now this is the new mutual exposure , why is it a good thing ? </s>
Well if you think that all my friends are nut cases like me , then we do have a problem , because exposure all of us may end up becoming even more paranoid . But let’s leave Charlie Manson and the Unibomber aside for a moment . I don’t think they’re representative of most internet users and their friends . </s>
The way Google and Facebook map out our social connections , they try to be very comprehensive . We see links from people we went to school with , our colleagues , our relatives , and so forth . It’s quite likely that many of these people will have radically different positions on 9/11 , climate change , Obama’s birthplace , and UFOs . </s>
So my point is this , that a link to the report of 9/11 commission that has been endorsed by someone from my social circle , is more trustworthy than a generic Google link that has not passed through a similar social filter . In other words , it’s a possibility that people would now be paying more attention or at least more respect to positions they would otherwise find crazy and conspiratorial , only because their friends are known to endorse those positions . So , to conclude , there are many good concerns about the future of the Internet . That of privacy ranks very high on my personal list , but the filter bubble is not one of them . </s>
It’s okay to hate Google and Facebook , but we should hate them for the right reasons . Thank you . </s>
Thank you Evgeny Morozov . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared US debate , where the motion being argued is , `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' </s>
Keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening , because we’re going to ask you to vote again at the end and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner . Now we go on to round two . Round two is where the debaters address each other directly and also answer questions from you in the audience and from me . </s>
We have two teams of two , who are arguing over this motion , `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' The side arguing for the motion , Eli Pariser and Siva Vaidhyanathan . They’re arguing that the internet is actually several internets , that they put up walls between the lands that are occupied by people of differing opinions , between nations as much as between liberals and conservatives . And that especially with customization , designed to give us what we want , that the internet is getting worse at bringing together people who are not like minded . The team arguing against the motion , Jacob Weisberg and Evgeny Morozov , they’re saying sure , maybe these bad things could happen someday but there’s not much evidence that they are happening a lot yet right now . </s>
And besides a tool that can and does connect strangers globally around the world by definition , almost , is a good thing . And that customization , perhaps helps to organize the way that we think . So I want to put a question to the side that is arguing against the motion , that when it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . Jacob Weisberg , you said as your sort of slam dunk point to the audience , you have to decide whether you think the audience is closing your mind . </s>
But if the other guys are right , they won’t know whether the audience is closing their minds because if their minds are being closed , part of having their minds closed is not knowing that their minds are being closed . I mean , but they 're saying that it 's an insidious thing , that it 's a stealth thing , particularly with the customization , that it happens in a way that it comes to you -- you go through this process unawares . Can you take that on ? Well , this is the minds in a vat -- </s>
Are you -- I 'm sorry . </s>
This is the minds in a vat argument in philosophy , that if we were not actually embodied , but have our minds in vats being manipulated by space aliens , we have no way to know . I 'm not sure I can answer that . But I do think -- Siva made this point that , well , for those of us in this room , this really is n't a problem . I mean , we 're media savvy . We 're educated . </s>
We 're sophisticated . It 's a bit -- it 's a problem for the hoi polloi out there , the unwashed masses who , you know , are just getting spoon fed whatever they get fed . I find that argument condescending . I mean , we live in a democracy , and it seems to me that we 're all responsible for the information we receive . And not everybody engages as deeply in different subjects . </s>
But the difference with the internet is we can measure it . You know , we never knew who read the stories in the B section of the New York Times about Albany and the state legislature . On the internet , you know how many people click on them , but that does n't mean -- It’s about 11 , I think . Yeah , exactly . </s>
But how many people actually read to the end or even the beginning of the story before we had the internet ? </s>
Well , Siva , take on , number one , Jacob 's point that you 're , I think , suggesting a little bit of snobbery here , that you 're saying , we all can keep up with things , but that there 's a great unwashed public out there that can be deceived by the power of these algorithms that are telling them what needs to show up in their searches . I merely meant that Jacob 's test , whether it works for you , was n't a good enough test , largely because you are just you , and you are not we . You are not a greater sample , right ? So if we 're going to be empirical , let 's be good about the social science we deploy . </s>
That is the worst possible empirical test , what happens to you . </s>
It 's almost laughable in its suggestion . So that ca n't possibly be the test when you address this question . But was n't your partner using the `` that 's what happened to me when I typed in Egypt '' ? </s>
Let 's talk a little bit about the studies about -- </s>
Eli Pariser . </s>
-- because I think it 's worth digging into this a little bit . There is one -- first off , the reason that it 's so hard to study this stuff is because the easiest way to study it is to get inside the black box of these companies . </s>
And these companies do n't have any interest in letting people go in and prove that these companies are doing bad things . But it 's very hard to look at from the outside , which is why there 's just not many studies that have n't been , as Jacob said , you know , funded by Facebook , funded by Microsoft , funded by the companies themselves . The one clear study on Google personalization that has been peer reviewed is a study by a guy named Martin Feuz . And it 's pretty clear . The methodology is good . </s>
He looked at how a search history affects the personalization you get . And it 's very clear , again , 60 percent of the search results on the first page are different for most -- for people who have a long web history in Google . But actually , the study that 's the most interesting here is the Gentzkow study that Jacob was referring to . </s>
This is a study that was sort of initially described as a study that showed that people are linking to each other and that the internet is n't as polarizing as we thought . And the interesting thing is that if you dig into that study , it actually arguably shows the exact opposite . </s>
What they did was they created an isolation index for each different kind of medium . </s>
And so the isolation index for cable news that that study used was about 3.3 . On the internet , the internet had a 7 -- an isolation index of 7 . And so it 's twice as polarizing as polarized as cable news . Now , what 's more interesting is that this was -- the study was done before the personalized internet . So the main thing that that study was looking at was the fact that a lot of people , their online serving patterns lead them to Yahoo ! and then from Yahoo ! out to a whole bunch of ideologically diverse links . </s>
But Yahoo ! 's changed since 2007 , since that study was written . </s>
And so now , Yahoo ! looks at your history on what links you 've clicked at in the past and sends different people out in different directions . Let me let the other side come in and take on -- One more , though . Okay , go ahead . </s>
Which is that the other thing that 's changed since that study was done is the rise of social media as one of the primary ways that people get information . And they did this isolation index calculation on people 's sets of friends as well . </s>
So cable news is 3.3 . The internet in 2007 in the Yahoo ! era was 7 . And people 's groups of friends was 30 . Now , that 30 has become embedded in every experience that we have on the internet now . </s>
So you know , I think actually if you look into the studies that have been done -- Okay , let 's let -- -- it 's quite clear -- </s>
Let 's let Jacob Weisberg . I read the same study . It was a little baffling , but it said the polarization index for newspapers was 10 . So the old media is well beyond the mean . I think you need to take all of that with a grain of salt . </s>
I mean -- </s>
But you cited it . </s>
I mean , this is the study that you were citing . Right , exactly . And it does n't show that the internet is the most polarizing thing . </s>
But there -- I looked at about half a dozen studies for this . And I would have to say , just trying to be as objective as possible , that the preponderance , the studies I did n't cite , say that there 's not clear evidence this is happening . There 's no evidence it 's getting worse . And I -- </s>
What do you think of the Feuz study ? Because we Tweeted about this . I do n't think it showed what you 're saying it showed . Let 's bring Evgeny in and -- </s>
No , I just think , it 's fine if we 're talking about studies that no one but a few people in this audience have read , so they all sound . But I think you also have to keep in mind that a lot depends on what kind of information you 're trying to access online . If you 're searching for a piece on Manhattan and I 'm searching it from my mobile phone , then Google knows where I am , I would actually want 99 percent of the searches also to be personalized , probably not 60 . Sixty is not high enough , in part because it 's very obvious that what I want to do is to order a pizza . Right ? </s>
So then if I am searching for political information , right , maybe the ratio should be 10 percent or 5 percent or zero . </s>
So to say that there is 60 percent of information that 's personalized does n't say much because it all depends on what it is that 's being personalized . Another point is that , again , take something like YouTube . So if you do n't sign in to YouTube , YouTube will show you at the very front page videos that are most popular with the rest of the crowd . </s>
You see all those fascinating cat videos . You will see all those videos from MTV . You will see whatever is now popular in the online world . They will all be displayed to you , and you will see them there prominently . If I sign in with my Google account , with my search history , instead of cat videos , I 'll see links to new exciting videos about history , about culture , about theater . </s>
Why ? Because Google and YouTube know that those are the kind of videos that I like to watch . So if Google can show me more videos about history than videos about cats , I ca n't really see how the internet is closing our minds . All right . Siva , are you arguing that the internet is closing our minds for your response . </s>
Thank you , Evgeny , for making two of my points . </s>
Number one -- that the notion of personalization , either through Facebook or another social network or through Google is actually tremendously helpful to us for shopping . It 's not so good for learning . When you want to learn -- About cats . </s>
When you want to learn about anything complex , the worst thing you can do is subject yourself to a social filter . The best thing you can do -- You need better friends . </s>
-- is to challenge yourself -- -- the best thing -- you 're the person I retweet the most . The best thing you can do , you need to get out of the bubble . </s>
The best thing you can do is seek sources of expertise , seek sources that have -- that are particularly good at researching particular areas . Use online sources that are focused in particular areas like health , like science , right ? That means call your librarian . That means talk to an expert . And that means go beyond asking a small set of people what the best way to explore a particular issue is . </s>
But for pizza , not a bad idea . </s>
And we can talk later , because I 'll tell you if you 're still interested . integrate 2,000 people that are following Twitter , one of whom is you , why not integrate those sources in my search results ? Why should n't I be able to see the searches of those highlights if no one is concerned about privacy ? Do n't you think the links you share or click on are not smart or interesting for me ? They are for you . </s>
That 's why you 're my buddy , right ? But that does n't mean necessarily that what I 'm doing is enhancing anybody else 's -- Why did n't you trust me to choose my friends and sources ? </s>
Eli Pariser , I -- </s>
You want to choose them for me ? We also think your opponents who are arguing against the closing of American 's minds through the internet have also made the argument that this personalization and customization , the filtering helps you think . It helps you organize . It cuts away the chafe . </s>
It brings things down to a manageable amount of material . And I can see the appeal to that argument . </s>
So take that on , Eli Pariser . Well , you do n't hear me arguing that all personalization is bad or all filtering is bad . That 's kind of a nonsensical argument . As everyone has said , filtering has been around as long as there 's information to filter . But the question is , what are the filters -- what are the lenses through which we 're looking at the world now doing for most people who are looking at the world through those lenses ? </s>
And I think we 're talking a lot here about Twitter , but it 's important to remember that Twitter -- actually it 's hard to remember in a group of New Yorkers -- Twitter is a fringe phenomenon on the Internet relative to Google or Facebook . Twitter has a tiny , tiny user base compared to these other -- sorry ? Only 200 million . Well , the -- but the actual -- the actual user -- you know , the active users , if you look at active users on Twitter , it 's actually much smaller , it 's about 25 million people , which is a lot of people , but not compared to Facebook , not compared to Google . And so we have to look at sort of how most people are using this stuff . </s>
Yes , Jacob Weisberg . I want to ask Eli one other question , I mean , since we 're dealing with the interesting implications of this thing that I do n't think is happening , how do you want to -- what kind of regulation do you want to deal with this problem ? Do you want to say that Google and Facebook are n't allowed to filter in certain ways , or do you want them to become this sort of paternalistic gatekeepers that say , `` If you 're searching for Lady Gaga video , you also have to have a little bit of this interesting study from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.” Right ? </s>
I 'm not suggesting that we replace the old media paternalism with new paternalism . I 'm suggesting that , if we built these tools toward the purpose of helping people get good information , including a diversity of perspective , we could do that in a way that would draw on the Internet strength . So I 'll give you one example , Facebook , the main way that you propagate information across Facebook is with the Like button . </s>
The Like button has a very particular valence . It 's easy to click Like on , `` I baked a cake , '' it 's hard to click Like on , `` Massacre in Darfur continues for 11th year . '' And so certain kinds of information propagate very readily . </s>
Other kinds of information do n't propagate at all . Now , without instituting any kind of objective paternalism , this is more important than that , you could put an Important button on Facebook that 'll allow people to elevate the topics that they believed were important as well as the topics that they think are fun and interesting and that they 'd like their friends to see . So there are ways of doing this that are Internety , that do n't require , you know , someone in a room making these value judgments but that actually lead toward filtering , that helps us seek -- That still does n't solve the filtering problem , come on , we 'll still be as close minded if you buy into a paradigm with the Important button , it 's just that now in addition to being close minded , three people in the audience will care about Darfur . </s>
Well , it 's better than none , but I think the interesting thing here that I kind of want to get to is -- I wanted to ask you about this , Evgeny , because you wrote a Slate piece recently in which closed with a call that was actually kind of more paternalistic than where I would go . True . You know , it closes by saying , `` It 's not unreasonable to think that the denialists of global warning or benefits of vaccination are online friends with other denialists . As such , finding information that contradicts one 's views would be even harder . </s>
This is a reason for Google to atone for its sins and ensure that the subject dominated by pseudoscience and conspiracy theories are given a socially responsible curated treatment . '' So can you talk about -- I was just curious about that because I ca n't make it square with your position . Evgeny Morozov . No , I think it 's very easy to make it square . I mean , first of all , public health , particularly vaccination , I think it 's different from political information . </s>
Political information is contentious by default . Vaccination related decisions are far more contentious because public health and often national security is at stake , so there is a difference there , first of all . </s>
So you think -- Second of all -- </s>
-- global warming is n't political ? </s>
-- second of all , it is less political than public health . </s>
Really ? Well , I mean , look , is anyone going to shut down the school or public square because of global warming tomorrow ? They will if there is an outbreak of an epidemic or some contagious disease . Again , you have to understand that this is a very particular context in which I think warning people about certain types of websites , which has nothing to do with socialization , has everything to do with certain publishers publishing deliberately misleading information about vaccination , for example , or about the risks of flu vaccines or any other sort of vaccine , and I think it would not be a bad idea for Google to show that there are sites which have actually been approved through peer review and through normal scientific practice and -- to show that , `` Hey , you actually have sites which you can trust . '' </s>
I do n't think it has much to do with filtering or the social layer . But when you say it 's not unreasonable for denialists to be online friends with other denialists and as such finding information that contradicts one 's views -- We have freedom of association so it’s not unreasonable -- </s>
But let me bring in Siva , yeah . Well , I would go to a less paternalistic position . I do n't think we should be in the business of telling Google what to do or telling Facebook what to do . I think we should be in the business of building new platforms , new tools , new ways of relating to each other . </s>
And having these conversations , I think everybody should read books about the subject , which is a pretty good way . </s>
And then adjust your own behavior and have those ideas echo through your social networks , that perhaps it’s a good idea to break out of the filter bubble . </s>
Let me ask the side that’s arguing that when it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . For some concrete examples of this phenomenon that concerns you , actually having caused harm to the body politic , because there’s a little bit of an assumption , and maybe you’re not making this point , but there’s a little bit of this assumption that all do need to be talking to each other and that there’s a middle that we’ll all reach in some kumbaya moment . But in fact , what’s wrong with having people entrenched in their own camps , angry at each other ? As long as the political spectrum is covered overall , what’s wrong with that ? </s>
And what examples of harm can you talk about that have been caused by that . Just a little story , when I was on the book tour for my book , I was on a radio show in St. Louis . </s>
And the host decided to make this big spectacle of having people Google Barack Obama and call-in and read their search results . It was a really boring radio hour . And the first person called in , the second person called in and they interviewed everybody and had people kind of do a read-off where they’re both reading it off at the same time and it was exactly the same . </s>
And I was thinking , this is the worse book promotion I’ve ever done . And then a third guy called in , and he said you know it’s the damndest thing , when I Google Barack Obama , the first thing that comes up is this link to this site about how he’s not a natural citizen . And the second link is also a link to a website about how he doesn’t have a birth certificate . That was your publicist . Oh , I was wondering about that . </s>
But so , I think the danger here is that it’s not just that he was getting a view of the world that was really far off the average here . But he didn’t even know that that was the view that he was getting . He had no idea how tilted that view was . And that’s sort of the challenge . </s>
I just want to address one other point , which is that there seems to be this question about whether this is happening . And it’s really kind of funny to me , because if you talk to these companies and if you listen to what they’re saying , all of these companies are very clear that personalization is a big part of what they’re doing and what they 're -- For pizza , weighted decisions . They are very clear . </s>
And they say we don’t want to do it for politics , we only want to do it for pizza . </s>
Right , and the question is , can you trust them ? Let me -- Jacob , I think Eli left a pretty good image hanging out there , of these folks truly not knowing how much they don’t know and believing what they’re getting and not understanding how slanted it is . That landed pretty well I think , so can you respond to that ? </s>
But a guy who called into a radio show ? I know the plural of anecdote is data . But I mean , if this were really happening in the way you say it is , wouldn’t there be some kind of decent study that actually showed widely varying results ? I mean as I say , I’ve tried to test this out as best I can . </s>
I’ve tried it myself on various browsers , signed in , signed out , Wikipedia always comes up first , sometimes it comes up second . Wikipedia’s vaccine entry is pretty good . </s>
I do not think there is actually the kind of variety you’re talking in searches done most of the time by most people . Siva . So , doing social science online is really hard because almost nothing is replicable . Right so almost any , even if you did a broader study than that , even if Eli did a broader study than that , the third person to do that study would not come up with the same results . For the simple reason that both Facebook and Google are constantly changing their algorithms , constantly tweaking their algorithms for reasons we can’t possibly understand and are not allowed to understand . </s>
It’s also important to remember that there are so many variables in what you get . There are some searches that are more personalized than other searches . </s>
Again , for reasons that Google understands and we are not allowed to understand . There are some ways that you can generate different searches because there are certain keywords that matter more in certain geographic locations than others . So a search for S-O-X in Boston or Chicago will yield a particularly strong result and personalized in those areas where as S-O-X searched somewhere else in the world might yield gibberish because it doesn’t mean anything . So all of these variables , plus the big variable , whether or not you’re a Gmail user , whether or not you’re signed into YouTube , whether or not -- </s>
Are you agreeing with your opponent that you can’t make the case based ? No , no , I’m , what I’m saying is that the empirical studies that have been done are limited in their utility . What we do know is exactly what the companies say they do . And they say , and they 've said to Eli on a number of occasions , that they personalize our results . </s>
And not that -- You have just disbanded the companies because I would actually prefer Google and Facebook to personalize my search results based on 500 factors rather than on just two factors . I 'm not interested in -- I do n't want them to personalize my news or search results based on my sex and based on my race or based on how old they think I am . I would like them to take a broader view and incorporate 300 factors , 500 factors if it 's necessary , rather than -- </s>
Okay , but you do n't get to say -- me into a social group to which I do n't want to be known . It 's a good thing . I 'm not interested in attacking or defending the companies . I 'm interested in explaining what 's going on to the best of our ability . </s>
And we are feeling around in the dark because all of this is in a black box , private data , and yet so deeply important to our public lives -- </s>
That 's how capitalism works . They have trade secrets . They will never disclose their algorithms -- </s>
I know . </s>
-- because if they do , you 're going to suffer . Jacob Weisberg . I know . And that 's the problem . </s>
So why ask the impossible ? Jacob Weisberg . I think there 's another point here . We 're talking mainly about Google and about Facebook that have these kinds of personalization you can turn off . </s>
Whether when they 're turned on , they do what you say they 're doing is a matter of some dispute . But most people do n't get their news from Google search . </s>
And most people do n't get their news from Facebook . They get their news from the news . </s>
Now , these are increasing sources of information of different kinds . But have you used Google news ? </s>
It 's not a great product , and it 's not one of the top ways that people get their news . People still get their news both from traditional news sources and from big online sources like CNN , Yahoo ! news -- Which is personalized . </s>
Yahoo ! news is the AP . If you go -- it 's basically an AP news feed . There is a social feature , similar to Facebook and Google . You can turn off . You can have it personalized or not personalized if you prefer . </s>
First of all , defaults matter . The fact that you have to know to turn it off to turn it off is a huge issue . There is a reason those social phenomena are on by default because it 's in those company 's interests to make sure that you do get personalized results . </s>
But that 's in our interest . I want it turned on . But you might not realize that it 's happening unless you happen to -- -- personalized option . I mean , Siva , it 's a chicken and egg problem . </s>
You will not realize that you can personalize them otherwise . And then I do n't see this as an argument . All right . I 'd like to go to audience questions at this point . We 're in the middle of round two . </s>
Our motion is , `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' Microphones will be brought forward if you raise your hand . Remember , about 30 seconds is what you 'll get . </s>
You can state a quick premise , but please ask a question that keeps us on the topic of this motion , and we 'll move along this debate . </s>
And I really do mean it to be a question , not a -- not a debating point . </s>
But we -- we did put out , on slate.com , who is our media partner , a request to them for questions from some of their subscribers . And we also -- is Lenny Gengrinovich here ? Did you show up ? Yep , there he is . </s>
All right . So Lenny took the initiative of sending a question into us by email . So thank you for that . And I 'm going to actually -- you can ask the question yourself . </s>
I just wanted you to actually make it drastically shorter . Just one page . </s>
And if you want , I can paraphrase it or -- I 'll go ahead and paraphrase it for you . </s>
He basically makes this statement : The tiny minority of democratic citizens who are interested in political ideas and issues can not have a discussion . </s>
They have freedom of speech , but there 's nobody to speak to in the internet -- ersatz world of discussions which only hides the problem . Do you agree that our nation needs affirmative action for intelligent conversation ? I 'll put that to Siva first . </s>
Most definitely , but we 're doing it right now , right ? It means that we have to have foundations like the foundation that supports this discussion . It means that we have to have universities , and we have to have schools take these issues seriously . </s>
And make sure that we are all able to understand the environments in which we operate , that we have to understand the nature of these platforms and technologies . And when there is a suboptimal result , we have to know how to correct for it . </s>
And if we 're not happy with it , to invent something new . On this side , do you want to respond , or do you agree ? Jacob Weisberg . </s>
Well , I think , you know , the low quality of commenting is one of the big problems on the internet . It 's one we 've been very concerned with , particularly -- Jacob , can you just come in a little closer ? Oh , I 'm sorry . We 've been very concerned about -- at Slate over the years with improving it . </s>
The big breakthrough , I have to say , came from Facebook , through a technology -- an interface known as Facebook connect , which basically brought identity- based commenting to every website . And it means that because people are themselves when they comment , they 're actually a lot more reasonable , not necessarily reasonable all the time , but they do n't engage in quite the level of viciousness and ad homonym attacks and just soft point arguing they do when they 're anonymous . So I think partly this say problem I 'm optimistic about improving through technology . </s>
All right . Let 's go out to the audience now . And right in the front row , right behind the clock . </s>
Again , if you can stand up and hold the mic close to your mouth . </s>
Tell us your name , please . Hi . My name is Tal . And there 's two main points in the premise tonight , one that our minds are being closed , at least more so than any other time . And two , that the internet is doing it . </s>
And I would like to ask the panel for the motion to address both of those issues . I think they have . So unless you feel that you have n't covered that , I think that it 's -- </s>
I would only qualify it by saying -- All right . </s>
-- it 's not as simple as doing . It is that we are interacting with these platforms at such a high and intense level without realizing what 's going on . And that 's what 's happening . So it 's amplifying what we were already willing to do , which is gather among ourselves and reward ourselves with positive affirmation . </s>
And that 's really mostly what goes on on Facebook . Siva , but first you argue to govern among themselves , but then you argue that the internet is getting balkanized , and we are all in our own little niches . I mean , how do you square it both of them . Ourselves , that 's one of the niches , right ? And it 's being balkanized nationally which then reduces the global political -- </s>
You aspire to this one global Utopia -- Very much . </s>
-- where people in China feel like people in India and Iran and elsewhere ? </s>
Yeah , that would be really nice . Eli Pariser . -- is , you know , there 's a great book called `` the big sort '' about how increasingly people live in communities that are like them , in homogenous communities . And one of the fascinating things about this book is that you have two things going on at the same time . </s>
On the one hand , there is a broader set of types of communities than there was 30 years ago , right ? That 's undoubtedly true . On the other hand , for each individual person in that system , their neighborhood is more like people like them than it ever was in the past . And so you have local homogeneity and heterogeneity at the top level . And I think when people are trying to make the opposite argument , they point to , hey , look at the internet , there 's all this different stuff out there . </s>
It 's so heterogeneous . Everybody 's talking . But actually , the question is , what are people 's local neighborhoods like ? </s>
And to the extent that we 're now bringing those local neighborhoods with us online , what effect does that have in , you know , amplifying the homogeneity that increasingly surrounds us even when we 're off line . I would encourage you to look at the recent issue of American Journal of Political Science which actually debunks , the big sort bulk with a load of empirical data and shows that even in the off line world , that this has never held true . Can you go up three steps , please , and turn right ? Ma'am ? </s>
Yeah , you 're rising -- on your other side , sorry . </s>
Just wait for the mic . Thanks . My name is . And I 'm curious about either the growth of your audiences or the decrease of your audiences and the quality and the quantity of discourse that 's been created over the past let 's say three years . </s>
So how would you relate that directly to the motion ? Are you asking whether they 're seeing a closing of the minds in the interaction with their readers ? </s>
In their own personal -- in their own personal writing and their own personal blogs and the information that they 're providing -- Are they seeing minds closing ? </s>
Are they seeing minds closed ? Jacob Weisberg . </s>
Well , I think I tried to answer -- I tried to speak to that in my introduction . No . I felt personally just the opposite . I feel like I 've never been in touch with a wider variety of viewpoints and people . </s>
And a lot of that is through social media , because people act as filters for you . When you find something that 's somewhat interesting , whether they 're a personal friend , whether they are someone in a field you 're interested in , whether they 're in another field or just someone you admire , they bring you a whole range of things , on Twitter , on Facebook . So no , my experience has been just the opposite . Siva ? </s>
Well , I 've written for Slate , so I 've had a great experience . But I -- my experience is narrow . My experience is my own , and my experience is based on the particular subjects that I cover , which happen to plug right into these questions , for the same reason that this is not a representative audience of internet users , my readers are not a representative audience of internet users . I just want to -- </s>
So I think that the fear that somehow diversity online is shrinking . I think my own case disproves that . I mean , I have an unpronounceable name . I was born in the middle of nowhere in Belarus , and the only reason why I actually have the attention and the audience I have is mostly because of the Internet , because of the Twitter stream I run and because of active writing for online publications and doing a lot of online research in Google Scholar . </s>
So I would say that the fear that somehow it will become impossible for diverse voices from Iran or or elsewhere to get heard -- -- direct interaction with the public has indicated to you that -- am I right , ma'am , you 're talking about -- </s>
But , I mean , if I look at the public -- </s>
quality of discourse . I 'm assuming that this debate is about whether discourse is closed , whether -- Okay . </s>
My point of my own case shows that it 's actually getting more diverse in terms of voices who never previously would have a chance to sit in an audience like this or participate in political debates but , you know , I participate in them . Eli Pariser . When I was at Move On , we tried a number of times to do these kinds of cross partisan conversations and have people sit down in a room together and talk . </s>
And it is amazingly hard to do . </s>
And , you know , I think it 's probably always been hard . I do n't think that , that 's a new phenomenon , but the degree to which people live in different universes of fact , not just different universes of opinion , in other words , the degree to which you ca n't even get to something to argue about because people wo n't even agree that , that 's a thing , is , you know , really striking . And I ca n't help but wonder as Evgeny has , as have many of us , if the way that the Internet is structured is n't amplifying that and helping people who believe , you know , pretty in my opinion , you know , misinformation , like the Obama birth certificate stuff or that climate change is not something that 's partly caused by people , is it amplified by that . Siva . </s>
I have a really quick answer . I misunderstood your question . I apologize . </s>
Before five years ago , I did n't have such a thing as Facebook in which to engage in conversation with my friends . </s>
I ran two blogs . And both of them were maddening because every conversation I had was overwhelmed by harassing people , people who were merely there to disrupt the conversation , not there to engage in a reasonable and rational way . We call them trolls . And one of the reasons that I closed down my blogs is it was so maddening that -- </s>
As opposed to taking lithium . </s>
Exactly , exactly . The quality of discourse in the comments plus the spam was just out of control . On Facebook it 's a lot more comfortable , right ? </s>
It 's a lot more pleasant . It 's because I never see people I disagree with . It 's really lovely now . I think I -- a lot of the questions that came in -- </s>
You follow me on Twitter , though . -- a lot of the questions that came in through Slate are similarly focused on this question of the impact on the quality of the American political discourse and they -- Levi Osborne in Warrensburg , Missouri , asks , `` Is it so much the internet in itself that is closing our minds as it is the hyper partisanship of these commentators which so many people listen to ? '' And by , `` commentators , '' he 's talking also not just about people who are online , but people who are also in television who are blogging , and people in newspapers who are blogging , but he 's talking about the blogging aspect of people with hyper partisan points of view , and -- Jacob Weisberg . </s>
Well , I do think the phenomenon of increased polarization in Congress is pretty clearly documented at this point . That 's happening , and I deplore it . I just do n't think the Internet has anything to do with it . </s>
I think the big drivers of that are redistricting which put people in districts that tend to go one way or the other and fewer that swing back and forth . I think it 's fundraising which means politicians spend all their time fundraising and actually do n't have human relationships with each other very much . </s>
I think hyper partisan media , of which Fox is probably the best example , have some impact on it . But members of Congress , these are -- if you want to look for a group of people who really are n't on the Internet very much , that 's them . </s>
I mean , I do n't think it 's what 's driving it . </s>
Siva . So part of the phenomenon of the punditocracy is indignation . That 's the currency . And indignation is a subset of the attention economy . In order to appear on CNN at 2:00 in the afternoon , in order to appear on Fox News at 7:00 p.m. , you have to say something that angers somebody , either directly in their face , `` I 'm angering you as someone who disagrees with me , '' or more likely you gather people on your side to be angry . </s>
And the notion that we are so addicted to something now we can measure , the click , the instant attention , the instant affirmation , just reinforces that , so it is a phenomenon that 's actually moved from the blogosphere , and that 's why we 've seen so many people who got famous being bloggers now are appearing on CNN at 2 PM , now appearing on Fox at 7 PM . Right , that’s what’s happening . </s>
It’s why MSNBC is filled with former bloggers . It is because they’re already adept at generating indignation towards one side or another . And is this a mind closing exercise or this just meaningless entertainment ? </s>
I think the results are . It does have an impact . </s>
But mind closing , yes . </s>
I think , just to take a step for the resolution . Eli Pariser . I don’t think anyone up here thinks that the primary thing driving American -- the very partisan spirit of American discourse is the internet . </s>
The question is , is the way that most people use the internet helping or hurting ? That’s the question that you really have to answer . Is the way that people are using the internet helping or hurting in this ? </s>
And I think , it’s hard to argue , most people’s social networks are homogenous , that’s just true . Most people do have social networks that are largely made up of people like them . Now there are the outliers for sure . But if you’re getting more from people who you know , you’re getting more of your news from people who are like you . Okay , let’s go back to questions . </s>
You’re wearing a lime green tie . You’re looking at your tie . </s>
Sorry , that was a terrible cue to give , you’ve got to look down . My name is Andy , so I have a question about confirmation bias . </s>
This is -- I really don’t know the answer , which is , do you think now , or before the internet , it was harder to avoid , whatever your ideology , information that would challenge your belief , be it the nightly news or an encyclopedia or the newspaper , whereas now , you mentioned Wikipedia . </s>
But that might be , there might be an analogue to the encyclopedia of old , but now you could just go to Conservapedia and find out that wow , Paul Revere actually , the ride was consistent with what it was described as . And so it’s a lot easier to find that information that’s going to confirm your biases and that would contribute to the closing of the mind . But Evgeny kind of addressed that point when he -- I think you said , Evgeny , earlier in your opening statements , that initially the theory was the internet gave us tools to do stuff that we were already doing . But the other side is arguing that without our knowing it now , the internet is making us do that and we’re unaware of it . So do you feel that your question was answered ? </s>
Well it was more the idea of seeking out information that is going to be feeding your own biases , whereas you’re not exposing yourself . You’re not going to be exposed as much as you would before to stuff . But is it , how is it different from 30 years ago , that if you , you could go down to the library and take out all the crackpot books that you wanted to . Well that’s the question . Let’s let Jacob Weisburg take that one . </s>
Daniel Patrick Moynihan used to always say , everyone’s entitled to their opinion but not their own facts . And I think we all agree that in a democracy , you need an informational common to some extent , where people are arguing about what they think about reality , not about reality itself . But I think Wikipedia’s a pretty great information commons . And it is again , the first search return on almost everything , or at least one of the first few . And Wikipedia has its issues and its problems but overall , Wikipedia strives to be neutral ground on an informational level . </s>
That’s an anecdote , but I think it’s an important one . I think the internet cuts both ways and in some ways , it can cut in favor of confirmation biases that you’re talking about , and in some ways it can cut right against it . I think we also -- Evgeny , let me let the other side come back to that , to Eli Pariser , is arguing the internet is closing our minds . </s>
Well just to go from anecdote to the study . One of the findings of the Pew study was that the more personalized Google search results , the further down Wikipedia was in the search results . So if you have an empty search history , Wikipedia is the top result . But the larger your search history , the less Wikipedia comes up . The more it’s replaced by -- so this was the best study that we have on Google personalization . </s>
And it suggests , I agree -- But do you see any logic , why would Google deliberately want to demote Wikipedia in search results ? Totally , I see the logic . What’s the logic ? I just think -- the logic , they have the means and the motives to provide the links that people will click on the most . </s>
That’s not the means and the motive to provide the links that are the most useful to people . </s>
Because of that burst of pleasure that you talked about in people’s brains . </s>
But Evgeny , I just want to let him finish the point . Is it because of that burst of pleasure principle that you talked about , that in fact , they’ve actually studied it . And that we feel good and we stick around if we get results that we like . </s>
Yeah I think that’s one of the -- You never got the chance to respond to that point . Google places no ads on Wikipedia . Google doesn’t care what you click on ; all they care is you stay on Google . </s>
Right ? </s>
They don’t really care whether you go to Wikipedia or Conservapedia or somewhere else . </s>
Right , and I think right now what Google actually wants to do is present the result right away without having to spend any time on it . So , yeah , I just do n't see the logic on which you 're basing that decision . But the response to the question you asked , I think you need -- we need to set realistic goals for ourselves . We are not going to dissuade people who deliberately decide to go to Conservapedia instead of Wikipedia . </s>
There is nothing policy-wide that we can do . If people already decided to seek those very biased views . There is little we can do . </s>
I think we need not be Utopian . We have to set realistic policy goals . And from a public policy perspective , to figure out what we can do , change design , regulate Google , ask them to do something . But to expect that Google suddenly can wave the magic wand and make sure that people stop going to FOX News.com or Conservapedia and start going to Wikipedia instead , I think it 's an unrealistic goal that we should n't even set for ourselves . </s>
Siva . Again , thank you for making our point . That 's basically what we 're saying , that Google is in the business of making sure that if you are looking for a conservative opinion about something , you 're going to get more conservative opinions about things . I 'm sorry . </s>
If you 've expressed a desire to click on conservative things , you 're going to get more conservative things . It is -- And we do n't expect Google not to magically -- </s>
Evgeny , hold , let him -- let Siva finish , and you can come back . Do n't expect Google to change magically . We do n't ask Google to change magically . </s>
What we ask is -- It does n't do anything , what you are saying . </s>
What we ask is that we pay attention closely to what Google itself says about what it does as is well documented , and we pay attention to the totality of our information ecosystem and the strong role that Google plays in that . Evgeny Morozov . It 's all fine if you 're paying attention . I 'm all for paying attention to Google . It 's just that Google itself goes on the record saying that they do not want to personalize politics . </s>
All they want to do is personalize pizza . I think from a business perspective , I see no reason why Google would want to serve you biased search results and show Conservapedia before Wikipedia . If you can produce a study that will prove that -- It does so mathematically , not politically . </s>
-- it 's a vast for Google . It does so mathematically , not politically . It does n't distinguish between a political site and a pizza site because it does n't do that . -- search for GOP , it knows you 're searching for GOP and not pizza . </s>
It does n't -- It does n't read what GOP is , it associates it with all the other GOP clicks . It does n't flag it as political . </s>
It just associates it mathematically with all the other behavior going on on the web . So GOP could be pepperoni as far as the algorithm is concerned . Grand ol ' pepperoni , yes . </s>
All right . I want to remind you we 're in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan , your moderator . </s>
We have four debaters , two teams of two debating this motion : `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' </s>
And , sir , right in the center there . Yes . I 'm sorry . I meant a few rows back . </s>
I 'll try to come back to you . My apologies . That was an ambiguous signal . And I did n't mean you , either , but -- I 'm -- you got the mic . You win . </s>
Hi . My name is John . So I do n't really hear anyone saying that information moving quickly and lots of information is closing our minds . I hear not the internet but internet companies or even personalization is closing our minds . </s>
So my question for the team arguing for the motion is , would something that was n't corporate , like a public search engine alternative to Google that 's nonprofit and not commercial solve some of the problems ? And then my question for the against the motion team would be , would you be opposed to something like that as a policy decision because you love personalization so much ? And I 'm assuming that this publicly -- this public service search engine would not be doing personalization . Well , perhaps it -- I mean , there could be a social aspect like , town halls . </s>
Okay . All right . Sort of public spaces -- That 's a really intriguing possibility of a public search facility or public search engine or some sort of non-corporate entity that would help us guide us in certain issues , right ? That 's a nice idea , and I think it 's worth pursuing and experimenting . </s>
I 'm not willing to predict the results . I think the important thing is that we try everything . The important thing is that we let a few things fail , and we try to learn from our mistakes . But we do so openly . We do so deliberately . </s>
And we do n't sign away so many important things to a black box . Jacob Weisberg , your point . </s>
I was going to say that the Google skeptics -- have you tried Bing ? There are alternative search engines . But I think -- I do n't think it 's something the government needs to do . I think the idea of a nonprofit search engine is not a bad one , but I do n't think it would fail to do personalization because I think a search engine that was n't capable of personalization would be tremendously ineffective and disappointing . And nobody would use it . </s>
If it did n't know where you were , if it did n't gather any information about what kinds of things you were interested in . I do think -- I do n't disagree . I was just talking about transparency . I want to go to another question , but I want to -- I want to confess that I would love to hear a female voice or two more in the mix tonight . </s>
And I -- I may be -- suddenly every hand went down . </s>
All right . </s>
I tried . Sir . Oh , right here ? I 'm sorry . I did n't see you . </s>
Let the mic come . Stand up . </s>
Let us know your name and justify my choosing you . Hi . I was recently reading an article by Ethan Zimmerman , I think it was . Zuckerman . Okay , I 'm seeing nods , yes . </s>
And suppose you do n't know . </s>
It 's an article about a theory known as cute cat theory , which is basically they applied it to the Arab Spring and saying that all of these movements , people that might want to watch cute cat videos , that 's the majority of the people on the internet . </s>
That 's what they use it for . There is a small majority who use it for internet activism . Now , a site like YouTube that uses the majority of people want to watch cute cat videos , but it also posts things like -- like -- I need you to target in on a question . Okay . </s>
Anyway , as far as maybe you guys can explain the cute cat theory a little better than I can . But cute cat theory , I 'm interested to know -- I think that the cute cat theory opens up the possibility for neighbors , when the websites get shut down to talk about political issues . So for those of you arguing against the motion , I would be interested to hear your thoughts . For -- for the people who have to edit this for television -- </s>
Yes . Could you just restate the question and -- </s>
I 'm sorry . No , no . </s>
I think this is actually a great question . </s>
And I like the idea that they 'll tell you what cute cat theory is . But if you could ask them about cute cat theory . No , yeah . </s>
I 'm sorry . I 'm a little nervous . Sure . Go ahead . </s>
Okay . My question basically is about cute cat theory and whether those who watch cute cat videos , when a site like YouTube gets shut down , if they -- they 're more likely to then go find out why YouTube got shut down , thus turning them into internet activists . Okay . </s>
Eli Pariser , tell us what cute cat theory is and whether it 's relevant . I 'm not -- I do n't feel well versed in cute cat theory , unfortunately . </s>
Who 's good on the cats ? Siva actually got tenure for his work on cute cat theory . If I understand the -- I think this is a question about whether people will rally to support these online media that they depend on when they 're under threat . So it basically throws my cats are the opiate of the masses theory . You get home , you watch videos of cats . </s>
Internet gets shut down . You go and overthrow Mubarak . </s>
If you think it 's a good theory , good luck . We actually know that there -- it 's really hard to watch YouTube in China right now . And for a while , it was n't so hard . First of all , YouTube comes over really slowly in the people 's republic because its servers are hosted in North America . </s>
Google knows not to put the servers in China . That would be bad news . During the Tibetan uprising three years ago , YouTube basically went dark . During the Olympics , it went dark . And it 's been intermittent since . </s>
And nobody has banged on the doors of the Chinese government saying , `` I want my YouTube . '' They 're busy with their own video services . </s>
They 're busy with their own business . They 're busy clicking on their own issues , right ? So it does n't necessarily follow in that example . </s>
The other thing to remember , when talking about the Arab Spring , going to a different part of the world , is that only 30 percent of the Egyptian population was online at the time . And then 11 days into the protest , zero percent were . SMS was a much more important media form for doing anything . </s>
And Al Jazeera was probably the most important media forum for informing people . So what happened in North Africa had very little to do with cats , cute or otherwise . Okay . Ma'am , right down in the front . </s>
In the third row , sorry . Right behind you , sir . You guys have talked a lot about -- </s>
Can you tell us your name , please ? Debbie . You guys talked a lot about personalization of the internet and why that 's bad . But I 'm asking those who are for the motion , what about people who go and seek out information in terms of wanting to comment on articles and videos that are against their own beliefs ? </s>
Yes -- Eli Pariser . Again , it 's not that it 's impossible or even that hard to find information that you disagree with online . </s>
There 's a great cartoon that someone 's staying up late at night and person tries to get them to come to bed , and they say , but someone on the internet is wrong . That 's like the experience that a lot of us have a lot of the time , but the question is whether the daily routines that we move through online will tend to bring us into contact more with people who make us feel that way or more with people who actually validate who we feel . And as social networking becomes a bigger phenomenon , and I think in specific Facebook , let’s separate Facebook from Twitter , it 's easier than ever to surround yourself with people who mostly agree with you , that 's who your friends are . Now , just to address Twitter in particular , like I agree with these guys that Twitter is like a pretty good medium for filtering the Internet and I use it to -- I follow Karl Rove on Twitter and I get Karl Rove 's tweets and it 's great . And , you know , I also follow him on Facebook , and I never see his Facebook posts because Facebook actually does a lot more personalization than Twitter does . </s>
Now , you know -- Is that a relief to you or -- Yes , it -- well , Twitter 's a relief -- </s>
Do you want more Karl Rove ? Twitter 's great , but Twitter 's not how most people use the Internet . No , no , I mean , the -- I mean , the lack of Karl Rove 's presence in your Facebook feed , do you want more ? The fact that he writes boring messages on Facebook and Facebook does n't find them interesting does n't necessarily mean that personalization is so bad . </s>
But there are a lot of caveats where you can say , `` Oh , well , Twitter 's great , but it does n't count because it 's not big enough . '' </s>
I mean , just to go back to the numbers a minute , Twitter claims either , their numbers , 200 -- more than 200 million registered users , more than 100 million active users . Facebook claims 800 million registered users , 400 million active users . I actually think Facebook 's definition of an active user is much more generous to itself than Twitter , so maybe it is four times users , but , I mean , it 's not insignificant . Americans spend seven hours a month on Facebook . They spend minutes on Twitter , like that 's just -- you know , if you look at the comScore numbers , if you look at -- I mean , it 's just nowhere near as powerful a medium . </s>
As I said , people who use Facebook frequently , all see all most recent messages . There is no personalization . If you use it not seven hours a day but just one day a month , then -there is personalization . And then there is no justification for you to see every single Karl Rove message because you only have 30 minutes and you have 5,000 friends and you have one hour a month to spend on it . </s>
There is no way for you to do it except for personalization . Right , no , I agree with that . </s>
I 'm just saying that a fact of that personalization -- So for seven -- for people who spend seven hours on Facebook every day , there is no personalization . No , that 's not correct . There is no personalization whatsoever . </s>
-- I went on EdgeRank and -- Evgeny 's right about that . No , it 's not true . There 's -- </s>
All right , we 're at an impasse . And that ends round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate -- -- where our motion is , `` When it comes to politics , the Internet is closing our minds . '' </s>
And here 's where we are , we are about to hear closing statements from each debater . They will be two minutes each . </s>
Remember how you voted before the debate because this is their last chance to persuade you that they 've presented the better argument . And you 'll be asked once again to vote and to pick the winner in just a few minutes . </s>
On to round three , closing statements from each debater in turn . </s>
Our motion is , `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' And here to summarize his position against the motion , Jacob Weisberg , chairman and editor in chief of the Slate Group . I did like one suggestion Eli made which is that there should be buttons other than “like” on Facebook . There should be a , `` I 'm not buying it , '' button , and I would have been clicking that the whole time I was hearing this argument . </s>
The Internet does n't change human nature , it just creates new opportunities for us . And if your view of human nature is that people are naturally inclined to be ignorant and bigoted and extreme , you 're going to focus on the way the web lets them become even narrower and more close minded . But if that 's your view of things , your problem is n't with the web , it 's with democracy , because people like that are n't going to do a very good job of governing themselves . </s>
If on the other hand you think people are capable of informing and governing themselves , you have to appreciate the way that the web , which is the greatest trove of open information that the world has ever known , empowers us and broadens our political perspective . Evgeny and I have talked about some of those ways tonight , and I think Siva and Eli have talked about a theoretical problem that just has n't been supported by the evidence or borne out . Does anyone here actually think that our political system would be better off without the web 's democratization of information and the multiplicity of voices , if Tim Berners-Lee had never invented the world wide web , do you think we 'd be better off if the web or Google or Facebook and Twitter or blogs were somehow magically taken away or regulated in some paternalistic way ? And I want to ask you again to think about your personal experience because it may not be an academic study but collectively it 's meaningful . Do you think the internet is making you more narrow or is it exposing you to ideas , people , and arguments , and points of view that you wouldn’t have access to without it ? </s>
In closing I just want to say that the idea that you and I would be less narrow in our politics without the web , isn’t just wrong , it’s actually preposterous . And that’s why you have to vote against tonight’s motion . Thank you Jacob Weisberg . Our motion is `` When it comes to politics the internet is closing our minds '' and here to summarize his position for the motion , Eli Pariser , MoveOn.org , board member and author of the Filter Bubble . </s>
So I want to read you a quote from two Stanford researchers from 1997 . They said , `` We expect that advertising funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers . </s>
We believe that the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it’s crucial to have a competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm . '' Now , the two researchers were Sergey Brin and Larry Page , and this was just months before they launched Google as a for-profit entity . </s>
I think that version of them was right . I think that the companies that increasingly control where and how we put information online have mixed motives . And the motives that they use in creating these filters may not be , and in fact aren’t in our best interests . They’re more likely to surround us with voices that tell us that we’re great and we’re right and we’re good enough and strong enough . And they’re less likely to confront us with the places where we’re wrong . </s>
What’s been interesting for me since writing the book is that I’ve actually been invited to come talk with engineers at all of these companies , Amazon , Apple , Google , YouTube , and Facebook . I’ve had conversations with people in each of those places . And it’s sort of funny for me to hear people try to suggest that it isn’t a big part of what these companies are trying to do . The engineers know that it is . They wrestle with it every day . </s>
They wrestle with the mixed motives , with these questions of how they should be building these platforms . And they know as one Netflix vice president told me , that they can easily end up trapping people in these bubbles where they tend to believe the same thing . So if you believe that the companies whose algorithms decide what we pay attention to , will tend to expose us to a broad diverse set of sources , you should vote with them . </s>
But if you agree with me that we should scrutinize that , and that these commercial interests will tend to use that power to placate people rather than exposing them to more broad senses of view , then you should vote that the internet has in fact , unfortunately , been closing our minds . Thank you Eli Pariser . This is our motion . `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' </s>
And here to summarize his position against the motion , Evgeny Morozov , author of The Net Delusion , visiting scholar at Stanford and Schwartz Fellow at the New America Foundation . Well I wish that Don Draper had a chance to respond to that 1997 paper from Google . </s>
Again , you may think that advertising is evil , but again , advertising is the kind of evil that’s also inevitable . So Eli has mostly avoided the what’s to be done question . In his book , he actually is much more I think straightforward . And he does want Google and Facebook to intervene and to expose us to more diverse information . More diverse information diet even , that you are normally up for . </s>
This second attempt is an utopian dream that is not realizable in practice . </s>
Do we really want Facebook and Google to start nudging us to pay more attention to Joseph Kony in Uganda when we are searching for information about our local city council ? Okay , but then why pay more attention to Joseph Kony and say not climate change , or Syria ? Who will adjudicate here ? </s>
Do we really think that Silicon Valley is capable of this ? Do we really think Silicon Valley should be in this business ? Again , you have to think about the proposed solution . </s>
Often they’re worse than the cure . </s>
Don’t forget , that in 1995 , in that article in The Nation , Andrew Shapiro proposed that the government should re-nationalize the internet , to bring it back to avoid all that advertising evil that you’ve just alluded to . Cass Sunstein in his book , wanted to force , by government , bloggers to link to their ideological opponents . </s>
He wanted them , conservatives to link to liberals , and liberals to link to conservatives . </s>
All of those ideas now seem very ridiculous . </s>
And that’s what I think we will think about the idea that Google and Facebook should be in the business of actually preserving us and presenting us with a more diverse information diet . </s>
Information is not like food . </s>
Politics is not like food . Diversity here is a very political matter that will not be settled very easily . Ideological conflict here is inevitable and I think this is why you should vote against this proposition . The sooner we do it , the sooner we can start attacking more important threats like privacy . </s>
Thank you Evgeny Morozov . Our motion is `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' And here to summarize his position for the motion , Siva Vaidhyanathan , chair of the University of Virginia 's department of media studies and author of the Googlization of everything . Evgeny has just done a great job to convince me that there is no virtue in the arguments made by people who are not me and not Eli and not made during this debate . We have not advocated a government takeover of anything . </s>
We have not advocated any Cass Sunstein-type intervention . </s>
We merely want you to be aware of the problem and correct for it . Jacob said , what if we had a world without the web ? </s>
What if we had the world without the web ? </s>
We might get there . </s>
Let me tell you why , because Facebook and Google and Microsoft and Apple all wish to be the operating systems of our lives . They 're explicit about this . They do n't just want to be on the web because the web is 20 years old , and it 's actually kind of creaky . What they want to do is be there with you all the time in your glasses , in your pocket , in your purse and on your mind always . They want to be your personal assistant . </s>
There 's quote after quote after quote from every CEO of every one of these companies that that 's what they want . And it might make things really cool for us . </s>
But it 's not going to make things rich and diverse . </s>
It 's not going to be the wonderful conversation that we could have had on the web if we had n't instigated these gated communities , these operating systems of our lives . We 're on the way to having a Balkanized world and a Balkanized society because of these gated communities . The fact is , nothing is determined here . </s>
We can decide that we like what the web was supposed to be . We can opt out of certain of these practices . We should encourage diversity , encourage other platforms . We should encourage experimentation . </s>
We should recognize that Facebook and Google and Yahoo ! and Bing and Apple and Microsoft are designed to gratify us immediately . And that 's great for pizza , but it 's not for politics . Thank you very much . </s>
Please vote for the resolution . Thank you . And that concludes our closing statements . And now it is time to learn which side you believe has argued best . We 're going to ask you again to go to those key pads at your seat that will register your vote on which side you feel presented the stronger argument tonight . </s>
And we will get the readout pretty much immediately . </s>
Press one if you support the motion that when it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . Press number two if you are against this motion . </s>
And press number three if you remain or became undecided . And you can correct your vote if you think you pressed the wrong button , and it will be locked in right away . And we 'll have the results in about 90 seconds . So first , I want to ask -- I want to ask for a round of applause for our debaters , for the quality of -- -- of the arguments that they brought here tonight . It was witty , and it was informative , and it went places . </s>
Thank you very much to them . Thank you also to everyone in the audience who had the guts to stand up and ask a question and to all the people who I did n't get to answer -- to ask questions , I was n't able to allow to ask questions , thank you , very much for your contribution to those as well . So going forward , I just want to let you know that our next debate is in May . It 's our last debate of the season . </s>
And our motion comes down to three words , `` Ban college football . '' And we had actually set this debate up quite a while back . It has -- it was not in relation to the Penn State scandal . It was actually motivated more by reporting that was done about the business side of college football and the sometimes harsh nature of the sport on the bodies of the athletes who play it . So our debaters will include somebody who wrote one of those articles , Malcolm Gladwell , who is author of `` The Tipping Point , '' and `` Blink , '' and he will be on the panel arguing for the motion . </s>
And he wrote the piece in the New Yorker in which he compares college football to dog fighting . His partner will be Buzz Bissinger . He is the Pulitzer prize-winning journalist and author of Friday Night Lights . That served as the inspiration for a movie of the same name and a critically acclaimed television series also of the same name . </s>
Opposing them , we have a football player , Tim Green . He is the former Atlanta falcons NFL defensive end , and Syracuse University all American . </s>
He was inducted into the college football hall of fame in 2002 . And his partner also debating against the motion , Jason Whitlock . He is Foxsports.com’s national columnist , and he 's already as an offensive tackle at Ball State University . So that 's our last debate . </s>
That 's on May 17th . </s>
And we would love to see you there . Also we 're trying something new tonight after the debate . Any of you want to join us , we are partnering with the New American Tavern to host a post debate reception that will be upstairs at Amity Hall . That 's a block away from here on Third Street between Thompson and Sullivan . Details are in the programs that you have . </s>
But our idea was that we noticed a lot of times people walk out of here still kind of energized and revisiting the issues and debating among yourselves . We wanted to give you a place to do it and get together . </s>
And to share your ideas across the partisan divide . So that 'll be at Amity Hall , $ 5 beer and well drinks . And I will be there for a bit as well along with other members of the Intelligence Squared staff . </s>
And finally , you are encouraged to Tweet about this debate . Our Twitter handle is @ IQ2US . And the hash tag is IQ2US . So we 'll just wait about -- it 's ready already . </s>
Thank you . All right . So the results are all in . Our motion is this : `` When it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds . '' You have heard the arguments for and against over the course of this debate . </s>
We ask you to vote before and again afterwards where you stand on this and how persuasive the teams were . </s>
Here are the results . Before the debate , 28 percent voted for the motion . </s>
37 percent against and 35 percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , 53 percent are for the motion . That is up 25 percent . 36 percent are against it . That is down 1 percent . We have 11 percent undecided . </s>
The motion , when it comes to politics , the internet is closing our minds has carried . Our congratulations to that team . Thank you for me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S . Thank you . And given that this is the conclusion of the third series of Intelligence Squared U.S. and that Robert Rosenkranz started this thing and it’s gone into its third year now , I just want to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Welcome to another Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I’m John Donvan of ABC News Nightline and I will be moderating the four debaters you see sharing the stage here with me at the Caspary Auditorium of the Rockefeller University in New York . Two teams , two against two for , two tables will be debating this motion : Diplomacy with Iran is Going Nowhere . </s>
Now , I want to make clear that this is not a panel discussion or a seminar . This really is a contest . It is a debate . It is a competition of ideas and logic and wit and possibly humor and charisma . We’ll see how it goes . </s>
But most of all it’s a contest of persuasion because these debaters are here to change your minds . By the time the debate ends you will have voted twice – once before the debate begins and once again at the end , telling us whether you side with the motion or against the motion . </s>
And we would like to register the preliminary debate right now , if you go to your key pads . Once again , our motion is : Diplomacy with Iran is Going Nowhere . Press number one if you agree with the motion , number two if you disagree and number three if you are undecided . And again at the end of the evening we’ll have you vote again and the team that has changed most minds from this initial position will be declared our winner . </s>
All right , we’re locking in the vote and we’re moving forward . </s>
And I just want to point out to our radio audience , because they can not see the hall there , that there’s a little bit of a buzz about the fact that one of our guests is the former Vice President of the United States , Dick Cheney , who is about four rows up . And it occurs to me , sir , by saying four rows up I may have ruined the undisclosed location rule . I apologize but I assume that we’re past that . So to round one , opening statements , our motion is : Diplomacy with Iran is Going Nowhere . Our first speaker , arguing for the motion , Liz Cheney , is a lawyer and under the George W. Bush Administration , she was Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs . </s>
Earlier in her career she served at the U.S. Agency for International Development . She was in Poland , among other places , and curiously , Liz , in a debate that is about diplomacy , you have done quite a bit of diplomacy in your time . Well , don’t hold it against me . Thank you . </s>
Thank you very much . It’s great to be here tonight . Dan and I are here with the task of convincing you why diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere . And I think it’s important as we begin thinking about this issue to stop for a moment and ask yourselves , What is our current diplomacy with Iran ? </s>
What’s the current state of affairs ? The current state of affairs is that the Obama Administration has privately and publicly offered direct , unconditional talks to the Iranian regime . </s>
The Iranian regime has failed to respond . So as of now , there is no diplomacy with Iran . There are no talks . Even if there were talks tonight , Dan and I want to describe for you why it is that those talks , in fact , are going nowhere , and it’s for three reasons . </s>
There are really three elements that should be present in any set of diplomacy to have any chance for that diplomacy to succeed in preventing the Iranians from obtaining a nuclear weapon . First , the current set of diplomacy of diplomatic outrage by the Obama Administration includes no threat , no credible threat of military force should the diplomacy fail . </s>
Secondly , there is no time line in place that would prevent the talks from dragging on and on and prevent the Iranians from using the talks as an excuse to continue to develop their nuclear program . And third , none of the very crippling economic sanctions that might actually convince the Iranians that the cost of attaining a weapon is too high are in place . Now , let me just be clear . Dan and I are not arguing that force is necessary . </s>
We’re not arguing that military force is unavoidable and we’re not arguing that diplomacy itself is doomed to fail . We’re simply arguing that the current course we’re on is , in fact , a course to nowhere . Now , as you think tonight about your vote with respect to this resolution , one of the really important things to consider , which the Obama Administration has not been considering , is the history of American efforts to reach out to the Iranians . </s>
And I wanted to just run through for you tonight a few of the high points of that history , because any realistic effort to use diplomacy effectively has got ta take that history into account . </s>
In 1979 National Security Advisor Zbigniew Brzezinski met in Algiers with the Iranian Foreign Minister , Prime Minister and Defense Minister . And according to a note taker who was present in the meeting , Brzezinski told the Iranians , quote : We will accept your revolution , we will recognize your country , we’ll recognize your government , we’ll sell you all the weapons that we contracted to sell the Shah . Three days later the U.S. Embassy in Tehran was seized . Two weeks later the Iranian officials Brzezinski met with had lost their jobs . In 1980 Warren Christopher negotiated the Algiers Accord with the Iranian regime . </s>
The Iranians agreed to take no further hostile actions against the United States . Three months later they seized the American , seized new American hostages in Lebanon . One year later they attacked the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and three years later they killed two hundred and forty-one Marines in their barracks in Beirut . Throughout the 1990s the Europeans threatened to impose sanctions if the Iranians didn’t alter their behavior . </s>
The Iranians did not alter their behavior and the Europeans did not impose sanctions . In 1996 Iran was responsible for bombing Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia , killing nineteen American soldiers . Despite this attack in the late 1990s Washington decided it was time to try again , to extend yet another hand to the Iranians to build a new relationship . We lifted parts of our sanctions program allowing food and humanitarian efforts , or humanitarian supplies , into Iran . </s>
And the President and the Secretary of State gave speeches essentially apologizing to the Iranians for past American behavior . In response , the Iranian Supreme Leader said these apologies were , quote : Too little too late and did no one any good since the Americans continue to commit such crimes . Now , you can read a much fuller account of this part of the diplomatic history in Ken Pollack’s terrific book , which I really do commend to you , called The Persian Puzzle . You’re welcome . But to , to be fair , though , it’s not just Ken who has been involved in failed attempts to reach out to the Iranians . </s>
Nick and I have also have our fair share of that , as well , when we both worked in the Bush State Department . 2004 , the European Union III completed the Paris Agreement with the Iranians in which they promised to suspend enrichment activities . In August of 2005 Ahmadinejad was elected . They announced they were continuing their enrichment activities and the Russians prevented us from attaining any real sanctions against the Iranians at the United Nations . In 2006 we took the step of offering for the first time in thirty years direct negotiations if the Iranians would give up their enrichment program and our European allies committed to imposing tough sanctions if they didn’t . </s>
The Iranians didn’t give up the enrichment program and , of course , our allies wouldn’t allow us to impose tough sanctions . In 2007 the National Intelligence Estimate , parts of which were declassified , showed there is one thing , actually , that the Iranians did respond to . Although the Iranians did continue to enrich uranium they did halt other parts of their nuclear weapons program in the immediate aftermath of the U.S. invasion of Iraq . In 2008 , despite the fact that the Iranians had failed to meet any condition we had set for direct talks and despite the fact that they were funneling weapons and terrorists into Iraq to kill Americans , we sent our Undersecretary of State , Bill Burns , to meet with the Europeans and Iranian representatives . </s>
Once again the Iranians learned that no red line is really a red line . </s>
To sum up this history let me quote from the man who was actually the note-taker at that first meeting in Algiers in 1979 . He’s our current Secretary of Defense , Bob Gates . </s>
Describing this meeting recently , Secretary Gates said , quote : Every administration since then has reached out to the Iranians in one way or another and all have failed . Some have gotten into deep trouble associated with their failures , but the reality is the Iranian leadership has been consistently unyielding over a very long period of time in response to repeated overtures from the United States . In closing let me just say that the history of our attempts to reach out to Iran offer us lessons about the three things that might actually work in terms of inducing Iranian effort , in terms of stopping Iranian efforts to attain a nuclear weapon . We’ve got ta have a credible threat of the use of force if diplomacy fails . </s>
There have to be crippling economic sanctions that impose a significant cost on Iranian attempts to attain a weapon and we’ve got ta have a timeline so that the diplomacy doesn’t drag on forever . None of those things characterize our current nuke diplomacy with the Iranians . And therefore , diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere . </s>
Thank you . Perfectly timed . Because we give each of the speakers seven minutes and that was six minutes and forty-eight seconds . </s>
Huh , huh . Very , very well done . Arguing against the motion , our other diplomat in this debate , Nicholas Burns , who is now a professor in the practice of diplomacy at the Harvard Kennedy School . But for twenty-seven years he served five presidents , ultimately as our nation’s top ranking career diplomat . And Nick , I understand that under the second Bush Administration you were the State Department’s point man for Iran but you were not allowed to speak to any Iranian officials . </s>
How long did that persist ? </s>
Three years . Well , here you’re free to talk as much as you want , as long as you’re within seven minutes . Ladies and gentlemen , Nick Burns . Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you . Thank you very much . I’m delighted to be here . And thanks to Intelligence Squared for bringing all of you here for this important debate . I can think of no issue facing our country that’s more important to our future , more important to Israel , more important to our Arab partners than the issue of Iran . </s>
And I thank Liz for her remarks . It’s good to be on the same dais with Liz and Dan . They’re former colleagues of mine from the United States government , and Ken as well . We hope to convince you tonight , Ken and I , that actually , it’s very difficult to say that diplomacy is going nowhere with Iran when we haven’t started diplomacy with Iran . I have something to say about this and some familiarity about this . </s>
I was for three years the point person on Iran on the negotiations perspective for Iran for the United States government for President Bush and I never met an Iranian government official during those three years . </s>
With the exception of a couple of meeting in Baghdad between – and these were public meetings – between our Ambassador and the Iranian Ambassador to Iraq there were no sustained negotiations between the United States of American and the Iranian government . So we attempt , we want to convince you that we’ve got ta give diplomacy a chance . We can’t give up on diplomacy before we’ve started diplomacy . I think that’s the first thing I’d like to say to you . Second , it is important to remember a little bit of the history that Liz reviewed . </s>
We’ve had three decades of a non-relationship with Iran . It’s the most unusual diplomatic or non-diplomatic relationship we have in the world . Since the Iranian Revolution there have been times when American officials have talked to Iranian officials but there have been no sustained negotiations on the nuclear issue and even on any other issue for many , many years . That’s not a situation that we should feel proud of . It’s certainly not a situation that advances our national interests . </s>
We have no diplomatic relations with the government of Iran . We have no business community , American business community , in Iran and haven’t for thirty years . </s>
There is no major presence of American journalists . So we’re in the extraordinary position of looking at a government that arguably poses the greatest challenges to the United States in the Middle East and yet we know precious little about that government . So that’s what this evening’s debate is really all about : how to be tough minded -- and I certainly agree with Liz and Dan on that -- about the Iranian government , but also there’s a twin challenge , a second challenge : how to engage that government sufficiently so that we have a much better understanding of what its bottom line is , of whether or not a deal is possible , about whether or not diplomacy can be successful in this case . President Obama intends to begin negotiations this summer , probably after the June 12th Iranian elections . </s>
My successor , Undersecretary of State Bill Burns , did meet with the Iranians once last year for a couple of hours . But the Obama Administration is about to test the proposition that perhaps we should have more extended discussions with the Iranians -- not because we’re acting of naivete , not because we’re weak , not because diplomacy is feckless , but because it’s our self-interest to gather information along with the Russians , Chinese and Europeans and see if there’s some way to maneuver the Iranians , pressure the Iranians away from a nuclear weapons future . </s>
I certainly agree that there’s a lot to worry about with the Iranians . </s>
They are seeking a nuclear weapons capability that would change the balance of power in the Middle East against us . They’re funding and directing most of the major Middle East terrorist groups that are a problem for us , for Israel and for our Arab partners . And because of their proximity to Iraq and Afghanistan they are fundamentally involved in both countries and in a way sometimes that’s very detrimental to the United States . </s>
But the problem I have , and I think the problem all of us have in looking at this question is , have the policies of the Clinton Administration and even the administration in which I served , the Bush Administration -- have they succeeded ? </s>
Policies of isolating the Iranians , policies of refusing to meet with Iranian government officials , calling for regime change against Iran -- I would submit that those policies have not worked . And the test of any American policy is not whether we feel good about them or feel good about giving speeches . It’s are they effective ? And therefore I think that President Obama is right to , to embark on a new path . What is that ? </s>
It’s a combination of engagement with Iran and also pushing back against Iran to protect Israel , to protect United States’ interests . And what would that negotiation look like ? The United States , Britain , France , Germany , Russia and China would be on one side of the table with Iran on the other . </s>
We would be arguing that Iran should cease and desist in its nuclear weapons ambitions , cease and desist in its support for terrorism . </s>
The only way to make that point effectively at this point is to stand opposite them and to engage them . Now , I agree with Liz . </s>
We’ve got ta be very tough minded . We’ve , I think President Obama would be well advised to put a time limit on these negotiations so that the Iranians don’t run out the clock . </s>
He’d be well advised to keep the military option on the table because that is language that the Iranians would understand , and certainly well advised to say to the Iranians , If negotiations don’t work we are prepared to put Draconian economic sanctions on you . Because we’re not gon na give up on this fight to make the Middle East safe from an increase in Iranian power . Why try diplomacy ? First , it’s the only way we will ever know if a peaceful outcome is possible . </s>
It’s the only way we’ll ever know if we can avoid a war in the Middle East . Second , we already have two wars underway in the greater Middle East – in Iraq and Afghanistan . Unless it is absolutely necessary do we Americans want to embark on a third war ? </s>
Third , negotiations will actually isolate the Iranians . It’ll put the United States on the offensive for the first time in a long , long time and it will actually increase international leverage against the Iranian government . </s>
And fourth , we are no worse off if we try diplomacy because if negotiations fail we will be in a much stronger position than I was as the person negotiating with Russia and China and the Europeans , to say to them , especially to Russia and China , We did what you asked , we tried diplomacy . </s>
Now you need to back us in very tough sanctions against the Iranian government . You need to put the weight of your governments behind the United States . We’ll be in a much better place to say that , to be convincing about that if we try diplomacy first . </s>
I don’t see how we can say that negotiations and diplomacy are going nowhere if we haven’t made a concerted attempt to try diplomacy first , backed up by a very tough minded American policy . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Nick Burns , arguing against the motion . </s>
Arguing now for the motion that diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere , Dan Senor -- a man who I know put his own security where his mouth was . </s>
I know this because in the early days of the U.S. invasion of Iraq I kept running into Dan Senor on my trips there . He located himself there full time to work as spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Government . He is now considerably better groomed than he was during those , that Baghdad summer . He is on the National Council , he’s on the Council of Foreign Relations and has co-founded the Foreign Policy Initiative and is here to argue that diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere . </s>
Dan Senor . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , John . </s>
And it’s good to be on this panel with Liz and Ken and Nick , who probably all agree on more things than we disagree . But certainly on this issue there is disagreement . It’s also always good to be considering debating a potential conflict – heightened tensions in the Persian Gulf -- while in the heart of the Upper East Side . Liz and I are really advantaged in this and it’s live on BBC , no less . </s>
I just want to pick up on something Nick said , that it is hard to say that diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere if it hasn’t really begun . I would say he’s right , the second part of that – that it really hasn’t begun . </s>
But it’s not for lack of trying . I think it’s important to evaluate not only the history that Liz went through , in terms of the decades of efforts to negotiate and deal with Iran , but also actually look at just the last few months and the signals that this administration has sent to Iran , even before this administration took power . In 2007 and 2008 , while this country was consumed with this fresh face on the scene – Senator Barack Obama – so was the world . There was deep , intense election night coverage in the United States but also on Al Jazeera and Al Arabiya and the Arab satellite channels and the different news broadcasts throughout the Middle East . </s>
They actually covered primary , they have their own primary election night specials in the region – the best political team in Abu Dhabi coverage , or whatever you want to call it . And they were consumed with this . They were consumed with it for a number of reasons , not the least of which is so much of Barack Obama’s message was a clear rejection of U.S. foreign policy under George Bush . In fact , in the Democratic primary , one of his sharpest criticisms against Senator Hillary Clinton at the time was that she was basically a closet hawk , that she would represent somewhat of a continuation of Bush foreign policy . And the issue he specifically drew contrast with her on that was Iran , because she had supported some tough sanctions that related to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps . </s>
And , and Obama called this a continuation of Bush policy on Iran . There is going to be change . </s>
And the American people overwhelmingly voted for this new face , this change , this rejection , if you will , which was a centerpiece of now President Obama’s campaign – overwhelming voted and sent a message to the world that there would be a new policy . Barack Obama’s inaugural address with President Bush sitting a few steps away , he issued some pretty sharp , very public criticisms while the world was watching of the former administration’s foreign policy over the previous eight years . He then in his first hundred days made good on his commitment on Iraq , which is basically to move along some sort of timeline for withdrawal , which was a big issue for the Iranian government . He has in recent weeks been very assertive about his plans for pursuing aggressively a two-state solution on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict – another important issue to the Iranian leadership . He traveled to Europe and gave a series of speeches in which , again , he almost apologized for U.S. foreign policy over the previous eight years and made clear that things were going to change . </s>
And then finally and most importantly , he was issued an unconditional invitation to sit down with the Iranian government , in defiance , I might add , of three Security Council resolutions that call on the Iranian government to halt its nuclear program . President Obama is putting himself out there . He is really exposing himself by making such a clear and bold initiative for diplomacy . The only problem is , despite all this , against all this backdrop , the Iranian government still has not returned the call . </s>
So it is true that diplomacy has not begun . But it is not for a lack of trying . </s>
As Dennis Ross , who is currently advising President Obama on Iran policy today , has said in a report that was issued by the Bipartisan Policy Center late last year , If we have to chase the Iranians to the table then any hope of diplomacy is off the table . </s>
We can , there can only be a truly viable diplomatic track if we can get to the table quickly , both sides agree that there is a real diplomatic process . At the moment we are chasing the Iranians to the table . </s>
We are off to an unwinnable start . </s>
So I would just simply say that it is true that diplomacy has not begun but it is not for a lack of trying , which raises questions about where it is actually going . And finally , I would just pose the following question to Ken and to Nick : If you argue that it hasn’t gotten off the ground but it will get off the ground , the question is , What is your timeline ? I commend a report to all of you that came out today issued by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Iran . Chairman John Kerry of the Senate Committee hired an investigative journalist and hired a number of other journalists and former Intel officials who actually traveled around the region to really get their own independent assessment of how far Iran is from having a nuclear weapon . And the report was issued this afternoon . </s>
You can get it on the Foreign Relations Committee website . It’s very clear . The time for inaction is narrowing . </s>
So if we say diplomacy hasn’t begun and we got ta let the beginning , the path to the commencement take place , and then we’ll consider how long the actual diplomatic process will take , is a tough sell , given the timeline that many are projecting , including as of today the most recent , the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . Finally I would say the question that needs to be considered is , What is the nature of the regime we are dealing with in Iran ? </s>
If we believe that there is a possibility of diplomacy being successful , if that is our objective to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear weapon on this path , what is the nature of the regime ? Is it a—one possibility is that it is a radical theocracy – in which case I’m not convinced they can be persuaded against a nuclear weapon . And if they are driven by some sense of martyrdom and some sense of inevitable outcome that is worth sacrificing their country I’m not convinced that they can be persuaded that they should not have a nuclear bomb . </s>
Perhaps they’re rational and a nuclear bomb would bring them national power , it would deter U.S. threats in the future , it would cement potentially their hegemony throughout the region . </s>
And if they’re rational and that’s what this is about , I believe there are no inducements we can offer them . There are none that , no carrots that would be better than all that they would gain from having a nuclear bomb . So if we are going to pursue some sort of diplomatic path it must have a real timeline that is narrow and it must be backed up by a very credible threat of military force and a very credible threat of crippling sanctions and a real clearly defined publicly available trigger point for those actions to take place . Thank you . Thank you , Dan Senor . </s>
And finally , arguing against the motion that diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere , Ken Pollack , whose point of agreement with Dan Senor back in 2002 was his book , Threatening Storm , which argued for the toppling of the Saddam Hussein regime . </s>
Since then he has written about Iran , arguing for negotiations and his most recent book , A Path Out of the Desert : A Grand Strategy for America in the Middle East , makes the same point – and I must say , ‘cause I’ve read it , is a terrific read . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Ken Pollack . Thank you all . It’s wonderful to be here . </s>
Thank you , John , and Liz also , for the plugs for my books . </s>
I can’t appreciate that enough . I promise to get you a check later on . And it is wonderful to be up here with my friends , with Dan , with Liz , with Nick , debating a very important topic . I thought I’d start where Nick left off . I thought I’d start by talking a little bit about the potential for a peaceful resolution . </s>
And we need to recognize that there is the prospect . We don’t know – and I say this as someone who has studied Iran for over two decades – at the CIA , at the Department of Defense , at the National Security Council and the think tank world . We don’t really know what the Iranians want . We don’t really know what they’d be willing to give . And in direct answer to Dan’s question of what might it take ... Why have they not taken the choice already ? </s>
Well , we haven’t put the choice to them directly . The choice that we need to put to them is a very simple one . You get to have a good , thriving economy which is ultimately what the people of Iran want or you get a nuclear weapon . But you don’t get both . </s>
The critical thing that you need to keep in mind – and I don’t think that Liz and Dan necessarily disagree with that -- but the critical thing that you need to get , keep in mind is how we get to that choice , how we force the Iranians to recognize that they get to have one or the other , not both . </s>
They don’t get to have their cake and eat it , too . I agree that this regime in Iran is not yet ready to sit down and compromise with us . I think they’ve made a tactical decision to talk to us . They have not made the strategic decision to compromise with us . </s>
And so the question becomes , How do we get them to that point ? Well , as Liz very nicely described , we tried , when I was first in the Clinton White House , at the NSC , working on Iran . It was 1995-96 , the period when the Clinton Administration , of which I was a part and working on Iran , imposed comprehensive unilateral sanctions against Iran . </s>
And these sanctions hurt . Do not believe for a second that those sanctions were meaningless . They hurt Iran and they hurt Iran to this day . But they haven’t hurt Iran enough to force them to make that choice , to make it the way that we want them to . </s>
Later on we tried in 1998-99 , my second time in the White House , to bring the rest of the world on board because we recognized that the only way to put that kind of pressure on the Iranians was to get the support of the world , to get them on board with the same kind of sanctions which could inflict the kind of pain on the Iranians that would force them to make that choice , the choice that they’re trying to avoid . And what we found was that the rest of the world wasn’t ready . And Nick and Liz tried the same thing during the Bush Administration and they found the same thing . And what we consistently heard over and over and over again was , You have not made a good faith effort with the Iranians . </s>
You’ve not put a deal on the table that they might accept , you have not given them a chance to say yes . Now we can debate about whether that’s true or not , but the simple fact is , that’s what the rest of the world believes . </s>
And until we convince them otherwise , they’re not gon na join us in imposing harsher sanctions on Iran , the kind of sanctions that might force the Iranians to come to that decision . Now the second thing that I wan na do , is to talk a little bit about what happens if we stop the diplomacy . Because we do need to think about that , it’s the elephant in the living room . If we’re not talking to Iran we’ve got ta be doing something else . And as I said , unilateral sanctions , no matter how clever both the Clinton and Bush administrations were in imposing unilateral sanctions , those don’t seem to be enough . </s>
And so if those aren’t gon na be enough , and we’re not gon na try to diplomacy , that is the one way that we might be able to get international support for the kind of harsh sanctions on Iran that might change their mind , well , alternatives start to look a lot worse . And I say that as someone who is very realistic about the chances of diplomacy with Iran . </s>
I could add , Nick could as well , a half- dozen other problems to the ones that Liz and Dan have already mentioned . Okay , we’ve been through it , we know how hard it is to deal with the Iranians . </s>
But the simple fact is , that diplomacy is much better than any of the other options , all the options stink . But some of ‘em stink a lot worse than others . Option one , we could do nothing . We could sit back and try to contain the Iranians , and deter them once they’ve got nuclear weapons . I don’t know about the rest of you , but that’s a social-science experiment I’d prefer not to run . </s>
Okay ? We don’t know what the Iranians will do when they have a nuclear weapon , I tend to doubt they’d actually use it , but I’m not certain , and I wouldn’t want to find out that I was wrong . </s>
And even if I am right about it , we’re going to face an aggressive Iran , one that is going to be much more willing to support its terrorist allies , all across the Middle East . </s>
The last thing that the Middle East needs is more trouble , more instability , more Iranian-assisted troublemaking in the region , and that’s exactly what we get , if we allow them to have the nuclear weapon . Another alternative is regime change . </s>
We go in there and we decided we’re gon na get rid of the governments . And the way that people typically think about regime change in Iran is , we’re gon na spark a popular revolution . </s>
And people say that because the truth is that as best we can tell most Iranians don’t really like their government , and they’d like to see it changed . The problem with this is , that revolutions are very unpredictable , and they’re very rare . </s>
And we don’t really know how to get one started in Iran . And beyond that , we have what’s called , what I call the Groucho Marx problem . That every—remember Groucho once famously said that , he wouldn’t wan na be a member of any club that would have him as a member ? Well , every Iranian oppositionist who accepts money from the United States of America , is totally not someone we should be giving money to . ‘Cause they probably work for the Iranian intelligence services , and they probably don’t have any support among the Iranian people , because since 1953 , when we overthrew Mossadegh , we have been the third rail of Iranian politics . </s>
And the last option that’s out there , and I don’t think anyone on the panel is arguing for this but let’s remember it , is war . </s>
Okay . We can try airstrikes against the Iranian nuclear program . </s>
But don’t think that this is gon na be a quick surgical strike . Okay , the Iranian program is big , it is dispersed , it is hardened . </s>
It is going to require hundreds if not thousands of sorties , to take down that program . And most of the intelligence people I’ve spoken to including the Israelis , believe that even a wildly successful strike would probably only set the program back by one or two , maybe if we got really lucky , three or four years . </s>
And the Iranians will retaliate . </s>
And they will rebuild . And we will have to strike again . Okay . This will not be a surgical operation , it will as Nick said , be an open-ended war . Another open-ended war in the Middle East . </s>
These are all paths that we may have to confront at some point in time , but I’d suggest to you that we shouldn’t do so , until we have made sure that there is no diplomatic solution . We’re not there yet . And let’s just remember , the very wise words of Franklin Roosevelt , a man who was determined to wage World War II because he knew it was the right thing to do . </s>
But who famously once said , that jaw- jaw is better than war-war . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Ken Pollack . This is an Intelligence Squared debate , I’m John Donvan , your moderator , we have two teams of two members each , debating this motion , “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere.” And we’re gon na now reveal the…debate— the vote numbers , we ready with those ? </s>
Do I have them in my hand—okay . As you recall when you came in you were asked to vote on the motion , “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere”…you pushed 1 if you were for , 2 if you were against and 3 otherwise . It’s a three- way split . 34 percent are for the motion— 33 percent against , and 33 percent undecided . And , reminding you that the way we predict—the way we call victory is the team that moves the most minds during the course of an evening and so it’s really a horserace at this point . </s>
On to round two , and in round two , the debaters address one another , they take questions from you the audience and also questions from me . I wan na begin with this , it seems as though we have a very basic disagreement on the facts when we hear Liz Cheney talk about repeated overtures , and Nick Burns arguing against the motion , saying that there has been no diplomacy , there is no diplomacy with Iran . to , which is it , has there been a lot of diplomacy , have there been many efforts or has there been… Nick , you more or less said nothing . </s>
Respond to Liz’s claim that there have been repeated overtures . Well I think I said that , you know , since 1979-80 , there’ve been lots of individual meetings , I think between Americans and Iranians , I think every administration has done that . But why is that not diplomacy— </s>
There have been no— That’s not diplomacy . That’s not what we mean by diplomacy . </s>
There have been no sustained discussions on the nuclear issue , which is the most important issue . </s>
Take…my example . I served in the Clinton administration , and I served in the Bush administration . In the Bush administration I had the responsibility for trying to put those negotiations together . And we were not able to do that , we didn’t meet with anybody , we didn’t have extended discussions with the Iranians , we never got in the room with them , in a meaningful way . That’s what diplomacy is . </s>
It’s actually trying to figure out what the other side is up to , what their bottom line is , seeing if it’s right for us , and smart for us to make a deal . And I just pose the following question based on that . </s>
If you’re not for diplomacy now , and if you wan na give up on diplomacy which is the position of Liz and Dan , then what are you for . You can’t say you’re not for war . </s>
Because you’ll then leave President Obama with one option—to go to war , you’ll have no credibility to go to sanctions , as Ken said . If we leave the diplomatic field right now , the Europeans , the Russians and Chinese will not support us on sanctions . </s>
You’re leaving President Obama with one choice . </s>
Go to war , third war… Liz Cheney— </s>
—for the United States of America in the Middle East . Liz Cheney . Well I think first of all , Nick is mischaracterizing Dan’s and my view on this , Dan and I are not arguing that we should abandon diplomacy or that we should not undertake diplomacy . Dan and I are simply arguing that the current diplomacy is going nowhere , and it’s going nowhere because it’s flawed diplomacy . Now , discussing this issue with Nick , you know , I feel a little bit like Alice in Wonderland here , because Nick and I sat in many of the same meetings over the course of a number of years , and , saying that we didn’t have diplomacy because we didn’t have sustained discussions completely ignores the fact that it was the Iranians who made that choice in many , many instances . </s>
And I went through in the beginning of the talk the extent to which the United States government has over 30 years attempted again and again and again , including our National Security Advisor sitting with the Iranian Prime Minister and saying , we will sell you weapons , we will recognize your country , we’ll recognize your revolution . And the Iranians walk away from the table time and time again . Now I think this gets to a very fundamental point that Dan made which is , what is Iran , what is the nature of that regime . And part of the problem with the current diplomacy , the reason why I believe—one of the reasons I believe it’s going nowhere is because there’s a fundamental misunderstanding , about the nature of the regime . You know , President Obama makes—gives a Norouz message to the Iranian people but also to the regime and he talks about things like common hopes , and common dreams . </s>
I don’t believe that we have any common hopes or dreams with the supreme leader in Iran . I don’t , I think the supreme leader in Iran believes in exporting terrorism , he believes in exporting his Islamic revolution , and I think that , you know , at the end of the day , you’ve got ta ask yourself , you know , as Kissinger was asked , is Iran a country , or are they a cause , if Iran is a cause , if they are a hegemonic , revolutionary , terrorist , extremist power , and they’re attempting to gain a nuclear weapon , then we are being dangerously naïve and irresponsible to pretend that we have now history here of trying to talk to them— </s>
Let me bring in the other side ? Nick Burns . It’s important to note that this famous meeting that Liz has now cited twice took place 30 years ago . Not exactly in modern times . </s>
I’d also say this in defense of President Obama . I’m impressed by him , I’m someone who’s not a Republican , I’m not a Democrat . </s>
I’m not a political person . I think he’s actually outpointing the Iranians . </s>
He’s put them on a defensive . That Norouz message was not to the supreme leader . It was to the Iranian people . And I think it’s— It makes a lot of sense . </s>
It makes a lot of sense to stretch out a hand , to the Iranian people , over this chasm of three decades—what has President Obama done ? The Norouz message . He invited Iran to a UN conference on Afghanistan . He said that the United States for the first time would join these negotiations unconditionally which I happen to think is the right thing to do right now . Because our prior policy didn’t work . </s>
With the Iranians . And so therefore , it’s hard to argue that diplomacy’s going nowhere when President Obama’s taken baby steps to put us maybe into the first phase of diplomacy . I would submit that we’ve all got ta give him at least six months to try diplomacy— </s>
Dan— —before we denounce it— Dan Senor . Can I just ask a question—or go—go ahead . I just wan na make one quick point which is that our opponents need to decide what their position is . </s>
Their position is either , diplomacy hasn’t started , which is what they both argued when they made their opening presentation , it hasn’t started , it’s gon na start this summer , give it some time . Or their position is , well , diplomacy has sort of started with some baby steps . Or their position has got ta be , you know , look , it’s started and the Iranians have responded well , you know , they got ta choose one of those . But I would say that , that at the end of the day what we’ve seen actually is the administration has attempted to reach out a hand , the Iranians have not responded and there’s a report this afternoon , uh , out of the Jerusalem Post that the Iranians are actually basing missiles now along the Straits of Hormuz . </s>
Ken Pollack , your—your opponent’s calling for clarify on your position . Yeah , look , I think that to say , have they started yet or are they just taking baby steps , it’s a difference without real substance there . I think the point that we’re trying to get at here though is that , we don’t really know what the Iranian position is . And more importantly still , the diplomacy is about more than just Iran . </s>
In fact the most important object of our diplomacy , are as Nick was suggesting , as I suggested , our European allies , our East Asian allies , the Russians , the Chinese , everyone else who is probably going to have to come onboard , before the Iranians realize that they’ve got ta make a serious decision— But is—isn’t that diplomacy about Iran as opposed to diplomacy— Correct , that is— —with Iran which is— That’s exactly—well , but both of them are interlocking . </s>
Because the rest of the world is not interested in us only having diplomacy with them , without also trying to engage the Iranians . That’s what they want . That’s the carrot for them . </s>
And in return , we’re trying to get them to sign up for the stick . Liz , I—if you , can you come a little closer to the mic— Yeah , I just wanna—you know…actually it’s not fair to say the rest of the world wants us to talk to Iran . I think that you’ve actually got a situation now , you saw it during the election , where you had the British for example act , you know , demonstrate extreme nervousness with the notion that suddenly the United States was offering direct , unconditional talks , which is basically leaving our European allies aside . </s>
Our European allies have been with us in the European Union III , we’ve been working on a multilateral course for diplomacy , direct talks cuts them out of the picture . We haven’t even talked about our Arab allies , and the notion that the Arab nations today want us to talk to Iran , you know , is a fallacy . </s>
What we’re hearing from government after government after government , is that they are very nervous , they believe the United States is about to make deals with Iran , and so they are now thinking do we need to make our own deals… ? You know , their concern is so great that we’ve sent our Secretary of Defense out to calm ‘em down , so the idea that the rest of the world wants us to talk to Iran , fundamentally mischaracterizes the danger of this new openness and this unconditional— </s>
Liz , I don’t— </s>
Ken Pollack— — disagreement here , and the— All right , I’m— The fundamental disagreement I think— </s>
—I’m , just to clarify , Nick Burns— —that I certainly have with Liz is that I spent most of my time between 2005 and 2008 shuttling to Paris and London and Moscow , and Beijing on this question . Those partners of ours want us to have talks with Iran . </s>
They have accepted I think , I know they’ve accepted , that now we should do it unconditionally . We— when we conditioned in 2006 , our entry into negotiations on Iran suspending its enrichment program , it gave the Iranians an excuse not to come to the table . Obama has taken away the excuse , which is one of the reasons why I’m impressed by his sophisticated diplomacy . </s>
And I can tell you for certain , that the European allies agree with this , and that they are ready to negotiate with us on that basis . </s>
Dan Senor . Nick , if the Americans have taken away the excuse , how long before the Iranians reciprocate , I mean , how long , you said six months , are you giving six months for them to agree to come to the table , or are you giving them six months , once they agree to come to the table , that then they have six months to figure out whether or not we can get a deal . You know , Ken and I are not arguing that diplomacy is a panacea . We’re not naïve . </s>
We know that diplomacy might not work , but if you try diplomacy , and give it a shot , then it does strengthen us for what’s ahead , what’s ahead of us . Two major options to deal with Iran . One is to go back to very tough sanctions of the type that we haven’t tried before , because we haven’t had the credibility to convince the rest of the world to do it . And finally the use of force , and I’ve said , we should leave the use of force , the threat of it on the table , we should threaten sanctions , but you’ve got ta go through this diplomatic process first , to get to either of them . If you don’t do that you have no credibility— </s>
What’s on the table is that the Iranians don’t want negotiations , Dan Senor said chasing Iranians to the negotiating table . Ken Pollack , do you think Iran , anybody in Iran wants negotiations— </s>
I think the problem is that the Iranians do want negotiations , it’s not clear that they actually want a deal . That’s the problem , and that’s exactly what Dan is getting at , and he’s right to . But , you know , the point that— Look , we’re not the ones writing out the policy for the administration , if we were we’d be glad to engage this question of exactly when . For the purposes of this debate , for the abstract expression of it , I think that the key point is again , what will it take to get the allies signed up for the tough sanctions . </s>
If it’s six months of making a good-faith effort , fine . </s>
If they say nine , fine . </s>
Now , we can’t let it go forever , and for me the big question mark is can we get them signed up to harsh sanctions in advance , based on when the Iranians pass certain milestones . That oughta be the key question . make a point there because that is an important point , and actually we did that . We had them as Nick well knows signed up in advance for tough negotiations in 2006 when we offered tough sanctions . When we offered direct negotiations , the deal was , that the allies would agree ahead of time that they would support tough sanctions on the Iranians if the Iranians did not agree to suspend enrichment . </s>
The Iranians did not agree to suspend enrichment , we got Security Council resolutions which the Russians in particular , as Nick knows because he spent hours and hours dealing with the Russians , managed to take every single tooth out of . Now we’ve , since the Obama administration has been in office , had the Russian foreign minister in Washington , and he’s announced that in fact he doesn’t believe it’s time for tougher sanctions against the Iranians . But , I think it’s very important for people in the audience , first of all to look at the wording of the resolution , the question is not all of the questions that Nick and Ken are trying to get you to focus on , it’s not should we go to war , it’s not , should we do diplomacy or not diplomacy , the question is , is our current policy going anywhere . </s>
That’s the question , and I find it really fundamentally irresponsible , for Nick and Ken to act like , let’s just give diplomacy a chance ‘cause we haven’t done it before . Nick Burns . Right . Liz and I are , I’m not gon na engage in attacks , Liz and I are friends and we’ve been colleagues— </s>
I— It’s not true— —honestly , I don’t think that was an—a personal attack— Oh— </s>
—that was— I’m— </s>
—that was right to the core of the argument— —it’s not true that we also—it’s not true that we live in alternate universes . But it may seem that way . Now what happened in 2006 when the United States government made the most ambitious offer we’d ever made…and I really commend President Bush and Vice President Cheney and Secretary Rice for order—authorizing that . We made a very good offer and the Iranians turned it down , that’s the Iranians’ fault , they walked away at that time . </s>
But what hadn’t happened— What hadn’t happened is that we did not have explicit promises from the Russians and Chinese , much less the Germans , French and British , as to what type of sanctions would follow . And so what Ken and I are arguing is that , it would I think behoove itself to President Obama , to make a very explicit deal with Moscow and Beijing , before the United States sits down at the negotiating table , the Russians and Chinese will specify the type of sanctions that would ensue , should negotiation fail . That would be a stronger position that we had in the Bush administration . this policy was actually sold internally , because people were told that we had commitments that there would be sanctions if the Iranians in fact did not suspend enrichment , now maybe you’re—now maybe you’re , it’s semantics about specific sanctions . But the idea was , the—I’m telling you what I know . </s>
What I know is that we had a commitment from those allies that we would go to sanctions , that they would support tough sanctions , if in fact the Iranians refused to suspend . </s>
The Iranians refused to suspend , and we got no tough sanctions . The tough—the word “tough” is not accurate . I negotiated that deal , ahead of time— You negotiated— </s>
—and I negotiated— </s>
—for weak sanctions . </s>
No I didn’t . I didn’t . I mean let’s be fair about this , Liz . </s>
Let’s be fair about it . I served in the Democratic administration and Republican administration . </s>
The policy of both President Clinton and President Bush has not worked…and we oughta have the courage to see it— I totally agree with you— —and the courage to admit it— I agree with you . </s>
And so what President Obama is trying to do , is to create a new type of diplomacy , it is very tough-minded . It allows us to fall back on military force if we have to , but it does give diplomacy a chance for the first time . </s>
We did not have commitments , for the type of specific sanctions that would go into play , and you haven’t seen that in 2006 and ‘7 and ‘8 , these were very weak UN Security Council resolutions , admittedly . </s>
And now we’ve got ta have a different way of going forward , with diplomacy . </s>
So if Liz and Dan say , diplomacy’s failing , President Obama’s failing , then I think what they’re really doing is leaving him with one option and that is war and they can’t deny that— Dan Senor , the—Nick Burns just made the point , why not give it a chance , it’s a new initiative , and he says in a new style , why not give it a chance . ‘Cause it takes two parties to participate in a diplomatic process and right now there’s only one party participating in it . </s>
So we can call and call and call all we want , but they’re not participating , and I know we’re asking everyone here to vote on this motion , as Liz alluded to earlier , the Arab world which is closest to this , is already voting . How they think diplomacy is going , how they think the current strategy is going , I just wan na read you an editorial from the Jordan Times . It says “Arab capitols have all the right to be worried about a new adventurous US policy in this part of the world that may again not succeed as planned . </s>
Washington surely can not dramatically shift its policy vis-à-vis the countries in the Gulf . The new administration lo—risks losing its barely- regained credibility in the region , if it does not consult its friends about its new standpoints in the area , new friends should not come at the expense of old ones.” This was not written at the height of the unilateralism of the Bush administration , this was published in the Jordan Times today . The Arab world is deeply concerned , that the message the administration is sending is it’s gon na cut some sort of grand bargain potentially with the admini—with Iran at best , and at worst , leave an open-ended process which is this , we’re calling and calling and begging them to come to the table and they’re never responding , and oh by the way the clock runs , and a nuclear bomb appears at the end of the day . So , debating , you know , giving diplomacy a chance , not giving it a chance , we’re perfectly prepared to give it a chance but just listen to those closest to it in the region . </s>
They don’t believe that there’s any reciprocity on the other side . Ken Pollack . I could—first , let’s , you know , you’ve accused us of mischaracterizing , let’s not mischaracterize what the Arabs are saying either . </s>
They are concerned about the negotiations , they are not saying don’t offer to talk to the Iranians , they are not saying don’t talk to the Iranians . What they’re saying is when you talk to the Iranians , do this and this and you better tell us everything you’re doing and you’d better not do the following things . Second , as Nick pointed out , the answer to the issue is not , that we only have two people at the table and one won’t come . There is a third party in the room , as we keep trying to point out , that’s the entire international community . And the question I would put back to you and to Liz , Dan , is basically this . </s>
You are saying you want tough sanctions . How do you plan to get those tough sanctions without going through diplomacy . Okay , I’d like to… I’d like to bring you into the conversation now and I’d like to do it in the form…I would find a way to say what you wan na say and answer , it’s a politician’s trick and… I’ll call on you , please try to keep your question to 30 seconds or thereabouts , really a question , you can make an opening comment , certainly to state your premise but we don’t want you arguing as well because we have four very good debaters here . Hold the microphone this close to you , and where’s the center microphone— Gentleman right on the center aisle here , please . </s>
Hi , I—I’ve heard Nick’s argument , and I think without getting in a more just round , in a circle , I’ve , from my perspective don’t see where the Iranians would give a lotta credibility to these threats of sanctions or war or anything else , so I would like to hear the panel kinda debate and address , what do you think the…make , make the arguments for what the Iranians have to gain , by giving up these nuclear weapons , and , what they have to lose . Ken started to touch on it . But it hasn’t really been explored . Ken , can you— And I would get into that to decide whether diplomacy can go anywhere . </s>
Ken , put yourself in the position of the Iranian government in a negotiation with the US , what do they want . Sure . Look , I think the truth is that the Iranians don’t want to be in these negotiations because they’re very happy with the status quo , that’s the regime . </s>
Okay , and that’s exactly a point that Dan and Liz have made , they’re absolutely right . </s>
We’re dealing with an Iran that is at least bifurcated , what the people want and what the regime want are often two different things . And that’s ultimately the goal of the diplomatic process . Is to put the regime on the horns of a dilemma . To say to them you can have what you want or what your people want , but not both . </s>
And you’re going to have to choose . And what we’ve seen with this regime is , while they are autocratic , while they control absolute power in Iran , they are very sensitive to public opinion . They don’t like to be put in the position where it is clear that what they are doing is the exact opposite of what their people want . And what their people want is a thriving economy . Their economy is in desperate straits at the moment , it is going down the toilet . </s>
Comprehensive international sanctions could push it over the edge , and the regime is extremely fearful of that . On the other hand , what we can offer them if they do the right thing and that’s what we threaten them with if they do the right thing , if they do the right thing what we can offer them is the economic support that they so desperately need . </s>
The lifting of not just the international sanctions but of our own unilateral sanctions , the provision of trade credits , investment guarantees , and everything else . We say to the Iranians , you have two paths . You can choose the path of darkness , you keep your nuclear program and your support for terrorism and everything else , and we will cripple your economy . And that is something that your people will not abide . Dan Senor— </s>
Or , you can do the other way , and we will make your economy thrive— Dan Senor— I would just argue that , it is true , the economy is in desperate shape , 25 , 30 percent inflation right now , 25 , 30 percent unemployment , oil trading today about 60 dollars a barrel . They are in a much weaker , you know , less than half than what it was a year ago , they are in a much weaker economic situation . But if it—what Ken is stating , that the Iranian government , which is complicated and opaque and difficult for all the reasons Nick said for us to truly understand , but if you believe that the Iranian government , is effectively going to make a rational decision and they can be won over with inducements which is what he’s saying , what package of inducements could we ever offer them , ever , that would be better than the situation they would get from having a nuclear bomb . </s>
I mean think about this , a nuclear bomb would be able to guarantee that the US would never threaten them again , we would— If Iran tomorrow decided that they wanted to go into Bahrain which they consider one of the original Iranian-Persian provinces , if they wanted to go , slowly take over Saudi oil fields , which would certainly help their economic situation , we would have virtually no leverage , we would pose no threat to them and as they’d try to further establish their own hegemony as I said earlier , in the region , having a nuclear bomb would allow them to cement that . </s>
What inducements do we have to offer them , that would be better than all that a nuclear bomb would give them . I thought that was a rhetorical question , but Ken , you— Come on…Dan , do you really believe that even after the Iranians have nuclear weapons we’re gon na let them take over the Saudi oil fields ? We did a pretty good job of keeping the Russians out of Germany , I think we can keep the Iranians on the other side of the Persian Gulf . I think trying to— This is a classic fallback position , trying to compare the Iranian regime to other governments , and other situations— </s>
But , they’re much weaker , that’s my point . Yeah , but potentially—and there’s also potentially an internal divide and fissures within the regime that’s divided between those who are motivated by national interests and those that are radical theocrats , as President Obama has described them , that aren’t terribly rational , and trying to figure out and game them out and hope that we can win over and resolve those fissures in the short period of time before they actually have a nuclear bomb , to me , is a pretty big gamble . And your partner , Liz Cheney ? </s>
Yeah , I mean I think it’s , you know , terrific to sort of sit here and say here is the ideal set of circumstances , we got ta have these tough sanctions and , Liz and Dan , how are you gon na get those tough sanctions , you know , without doing diplomacy . And I would say the history of the relationship shows , we aren’t gon na get tough sanctions with diplomacy , the current diplomacy that we’ve got , at the end of the day , what Dan is—the argument Dan’s making is absolutely right that , the Ira— There are not inducements at this point , there are not inducements that make the Iranians better off than having the bomb . What does cause the Iranians to alter their behavior and what we have seen historically is if they believe that there is a credible threat of military force if they don’t alter their behavior . This is also true of our European allies . And as you’re talking about this diplomacy I think we need to think about the motives of all of the people , all the partners involved here . </s>
You know , the Europeans , as we’ve seen throughout , they like their commercial relationships with Iran , and they don’t like the notion that the United States is gon na use military force against Iran . </s>
If they believe the threat of military force is on the table , that’s frankly the only thing I’ve seen that convinces them they better get serious about sanctions . We have not seen them serious about sanctions , and I think the idea that we’re gon na call this current diplomacy strong or tough diplomacy , it simply doesn’t bear out if you look at the facts . </s>
This is diplomacy with no teeth , this is , you know , an open hand , direct and unconditional . And— Question from the second row . You can stand up and , if you’re a member of the press please identify yourself . </s>
pardon me , I’m nervous with this distinguished panel and this audience . I’ve one simple question for the Burns-Pollack team , with this basic background . Hope springs eternal , but history tends to repeat itself . And we’ve had 30 years of diplomacy with a capital or small “d.” We’ve had , Burns admits that in the , I think he said , ’96 or ’97 , we gave a real good deal , and Iran flipped us whatever you wan na insert after that . My question is this . </s>
In the concept of we don’t know what Iran wants , I mean , we listen— </s>
You know—go to your question— My question is , can either Burns or Pollack point to any single thing , over the past 30 years , including Obama’s welcome mat of the last few months , that gives us any hope that history won’t repeat itself , and that diplomacy has ever gone anywhere . Thank you very much . Thank you for your question . </s>
I just fundamentally disagree with Liz and Dan , that there’s been diplomacy , over the last 30 years , I am a professional diplomat , I now teach diplomacy , at a university . It hasn’t been diplomacy . We have not had sustained engagement with the Iranians . And the problem I have and what I find slightly irresponsible about the other side’s position , they wan na strangle this current diplomatic initiative of President Barack Obama , in its infancy . It’s about 30 days old . </s>
President Obama rolled out most of what he thinks should happen about 30 days ago . I think what you can expect , is that after the June 12th Presidential elections in Iran , you’re gon na see Iran accept negotiations , you’re gon na see Iran at the negotiating table . My best judgment would be that first round of talks will likely fail . I’m trying to strengthen us , in arguing for this policy , for the sanctions that come , and trying to strengthen us to find a way to deny Iran a nuclear weapons capability . If you start from the presumption that diplomacy is soft , and weak and un- American , and there are some people who believe that , then I can’t help you . </s>
Because that—that you’re just left with a military option . I think we’ve got ta stage this , we’ve got ta think 15 or 16 moves down the chess board . I think that’s what President Obama is trying to do , give him a chance , and let’s show a little patience for diplomacy to play out . </s>
Neither Dan nor I are trying to strangle these efforts , in fact we are very hopeful that these efforts will succeed , I think everybody on this panel wants diplomacy to succeed in stopping Iranians’ nuclear weapons program . But I think that you have got to be realistic about what it will take to have that success . And when I hear Nick talk about 15 or 16 moves down the table and the first round is gon na fail , people need to look at how the Iranians in the past have described these discussions with us . In August of 2005 , the chief Iranian nuclear negotiator gave an interview on Iranian television in which he explained in great detail and with great pride , that he was using the negotiations in order to gain the time that they needed to get the nuclear program up and running . He admitted it , he was open about it . </s>
The notion that , we’ve got 15 or 16 moves and we’ve got all kinds of time , I mean , I’d like to hear Nick explain how he can feel comfortable that we’ve got the time to undertake the kind of slow and cautious , toothless diplomacy , that we’re currently engaged in . </s>
I just wan na correct the record in one— Did—did he really say toothless at point— </s>
No , I said— I want to correct the record in one aspect , when Ahmadinejad was elected and sworn in in August of 2005 and when the Iranian negotiator made those remarks , he was not referring to negotiations with the United States , we were not in negotiations . The British and French and Germans were . </s>
The Russians and Chinese were in it . The diplomacy has evolved , so to suggest somehow , that because of the European negotiations failed in 2005 , the United States should therefore not enter negotiations , is just not historically right . In the way that , in the way that Liz put it— </s>
No . What I’m suggest— </s>
And I think that anyone who—I’m just gon na finish my thought if I could . I think that anybody— I think that anybody who understands diplomacy and tries to learn from it understands that it doesn’t occur over a 30 , or 40-day time period and here’s the weakness , in Liz and Dan’s argument . They’re arguing against something that has just begun . And we’ve got ta have the patience and determination to see this first phase concluded , or else , or else we leave ourselves with no appreciable option to resolve this peacefully if that’s possible . Dan , very briefly— </s>
We’re not—wait , I just need— I wan na go to—back to the audience but Dan , very briefly respond to that . </s>
I will give my time— You will cede your time— —to my partner here— —to your partner . </s>
That was a very wise move— I , you know… To say diplomacy has not begun ignores the 30 years of history . And the point that I was making about the Iranian nuclear negotiator was , the Iranians used negotiations to stall , they used negotiations to buy time . So , Nick , are you saying you don’t believe that they’ll use negotiations to buy time if we’re at the table ? </s>
No , I assumed you listened respectfully when I was speaking as I did when you were . I said— I said , we should be tough-minded . We should impose a time limit on the discussions . We should work out the sanctions regime with the Russians and Chinese before we sit down with the Iranians , and we should leave force on the table . </s>
That’s tough-minded diplomacy , it’s certainly not toothless— That’s not the current— Question from the cen— —that’s not the current diplomacy— </s>
Question from the center , please . </s>
Thank you very much for an incredibly interesting panel and very illuminating comments…I think you’re offering very compelling arguments for both sides and I’m actually undecided at this point . To help me decide , it would be really great to know what both sides of the panel think in terms of , who exactly are the key allies we wan na sign up for the tough sanctions against Iran . And what exactly are the tough sanctions , because , I have—I’m just wondering if both sides agree on what exactly both of those are . </s>
Thanks . Nick . That’s an excellent question and I think the tough allies that we need are not the Europeans . </s>
The Europeans have actually cut their trade with Iran by two thirds since 2005 , they’re moving in the right direction . What has happened to us . </s>
The Chinese have fundamentally watered down and violated the UN sanctions , they’re the number-one trade partner with Iran . The Russians sell arms to Iran . </s>
The Arabs , who profess to be very concerned about the rise of Iran , trade with Iran every day . Specifically Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates , the Japanese and the South Koreans trade . So what President Obama has to do , and what we tried very hard to do in our time in office , was to get all those countries to agree , that if the United States tries diplomacy it’s not gon na be feckless and toothless , that they will join us , they will commit to us . We did not have that agreement , in 2006 , specifically , we should try to get it now . Question from the far side ? </s>
I have two questions , my first question is , isn’t it a little bit— I’d just like you to actually pick your favorite question . Okay , my favorite question— They go hand in hand but it’s okay . It’s directed toward Miss Cheney . Isn’t it a little bit convenient to place a historical context—historically contextualize your argument just to 1979 , being that the United States helped to overthrow Iran and Iran’s first democratically elected government in 1953 ? </s>
That’s not something that happened 200 years ago , it’s something that happened in my grandfather and my mother’s lifetime so it’s pretty , I would imagine for people living in Iran it’s still a pretty salient point . Well , I think the reason that you start in 1979 is because it’s the same government , it’s the government that took over after the revolution in 1979 , and the people that we’re dealing with today are the heirs of the people that we were dealing with in 1979 . Now , there has been in many instances and we talked about it , you know , sort of this elusive attempt to find reformers , and I think a lot of what Ken did for example , during the Clinton administration was , attempt to reach out to those reformers . You know , people talk about who’s up and who’s down , but at the end of the day I think what you’ve got is clearly a situation where , the government we’re dealing with today , in terms of its ideology , its objectives , its desires and its approach to the rest of the world and its approach to us , are in fact , you know , they—they’re the Islamic government of Iran , they’re the inheritors of those that we were dealing with in ’79 , which is why , I began in ’79 , I mean you could go back thousands of years presumably as well . Can I just— </s>
Okay , your partner would like to add to that— Yeah , I would just like to clarify one point ‘cause there’s clearly…and— </s>
Is this in relation to the question or— It’s connected— —looking back , okay— </s>
It’s connected— No , I don’t mind , I just— </s>
Yeah— — wan na know , what the framework is— </s>
Nick and Ken keep setting up this false choice . Either diplomacy , or military action . </s>
And what Liz and I are arguing , is we are all for diplomacy . We are for diplomacy that actually results in a diplomatic process beginning . </s>
The process has not begun . We are—and we believe that that diplomatic process will only get going , if it is backed up by credible threat of military action , we are not arguing for military action . </s>
But we are—we do believe that the Obama administration has to persuade our allies— But I—I believe I’ve heard the other side say exactly the same thing— </s>
But , — Right— —but hold on— But , can I— </s>
That’s right , all four of us are arguing for the motion— Exactly , President Obama— President Obama’s strategy does not involve that , so if Nick and Ken wan na come to our side and acknowledge that that is the problem . President Obama has not made clear that military action is serious and credible— </s>
All right , let me bring in Ken—let me bring in Ken , Nick , ‘cause— Okay— </s>
—he hasn’t spoken in a bit— I think— I was thrilled to hear Liz say that you guys are in favor , you want diplomacy to work . The question I would have for you is , what is it about what we’re doing now that you think is inadequate , what more do you want to do . ‘Cause my guess is not only would we sign up for it , my guess is the Obama administration would sign up for it too . I don’t know if the Obama administration’s gon na be inviting the Cheney-Senor team into… to prescribe their policy on Iran , but hey , you know , stranger things have happened— </s>
You know ? Change is coming to America . It’s the Middle East . Sorry . Nick . </s>
Nick , did you wan na follow up ‘cause I have another question or I can go to— I think that Dan has not given President Obama sufficient credit . I heard him say during the campaign on multiple occasions , that he believed that we should leave the use of force on the table . We haven’t seen the full articulation of the policy . </s>
I have every reason to believe it’s gon na be very hard- headed and very tough-minded , it’ll include all the things that all of us are talking about . So to suggest that somehow this is feckless , toothless , soft , ineffective diplomacy , when it’s likely to include all the elements that Liz and Dan have suggested , I think is a little bit premature . I don’t disagree , I hope President Obama comes forth with that , he hasn’t done so yet , my only point is if you are going to have a credible use—if you’re gon na have a credible threat of force , you have to articulate a timeline , a trigger point , and a credible threat of force . President Obama has done all the things that you have , have hoped he would do , except that last piece , so I don’t know why anybody in the Iranian regime , or among our allies , would take that threat that you’re positing as serious when the President himself has not taken it— Nick , last year during the campaign you wrote in support of the President’s offer to talk to adversaries . </s>
You wrote a piece in Newsweek in which you said , “We should have enough self- confidence to talk to your adversaries , ” why is it a matter of self- confidence . There is this notion , in some parts of the political spectrum that we should not talk to governments with which we disagree . I don’t think that is in our self-interest . And I think we oughta have the self-confidence to understand that whoever represents the United States of America at the negotiating table is going to be tough- minded . </s>
Is going to try to achieve— But you’re not hearing that argument from this other side of the table today , that’s not the— Not today . But certainly I think one of the weaknesses of the Clinton approach and frankly , the approach in which I was involved , was that we didn’t have enough self-confidence to get to the table and trust ourselves , I think we weakened the diplomatic effort in 2006 , by not attempting to talk to the Iranians , so I think the United States needs to engage those governments with , with which we disagree , Zimbabwe , — </s>
Liz— </s>
And Iran , and Burma , governments like that . Liz Cheney . How much time do you give the Iranians . </s>
How much time would you give the Iranians . So we’ve got ta have this tough-minded diplomacy that you promise is coming , although I have to say the resolution says it’s going nowhere now , just to remind people in the audience . But how much time . I mean I understand what you’re saying… </s>
I don’t see the word “now.” It says “is going nowhere , ” it’s present tense . But at any rate , um… But it’s , it’s a serious question— You could read the future tense into that— It’s a—no you can’t actually— </s>
Of course you can . Liz , if you can— </s>
It’s a serious question— —if you’re in favor of diplomacy too let us throw it back to you , how much time would you give it . I would give it very little time . How much— How much ? </s>
And I would say— I would give it basically enough time that we could actually sort of test out , the extent to which we’re serious about using force , I mean I , you know , my own view is the window is closing pretty fast here . I would say , you know , we’re very close to the point where , the Iranians themselves may in fact be near the point where any action that we take is insufficient to prevent them from actually gaining the value and the benefit of having at least the threat of a nuclear program— So is that six months or 12 or 18 ? You know , I’d say I’m— But the—but the question— </s>
I’m closer— —was actually put to you— I know , that’s why I’m putting it back to Liz ‘cause she’s saying— But , but— </s>
—she’s in favor too— But do you—but do you— </s>
Maybe— —have an answer for her— John , maybe the problem is just three months , maybe Liz believes six and we believe nine . No , no , but it’s not just time , it—time as you heard me say at the beginning , time is key . </s>
Now I— my patience has , as you know , been tested and I think probably is closer to the breaking point than Nick’s is . And I think that’s a responsible position . Because I think to take the position that you guys are taking which is , yes , it’s definitely going somewhere , although it hasn’t really started yet , and once it starts , it’s gon na take us a long time because , you know , to do this professionally— That’s not our position at all , Liz , our position is that— </s>
You’ve said all of those things— Our—no , no , no , that’s absolutely untrue , and you go back and look at the transcript— All right , but Nick said— What we said was— </s>
Okay , we’re getting to transcript review— —what , what , that— </s>
—I wan na move on to another question— —we need to pull this out to get the allies onboard— Gentleman in the second row— —for the tough sanctions— Gent—gentleman— </s>
What makes you think— —in the second row has been very patient— But what makes you think— If a game-changer is required , and it seems to be , would Russia support effective sanctions if we rethought our position on missiles in eastern Europe , and are there similar quid pro quos we could offer the Chinese for them to support effective sanctions , and would that not change the whole situation . </s>
Ken ? That’s up your alley . Okay , you’ve asked a critical question , and this is part of what has to happen with the diplomacy . </s>
We don’t know the answers to those questions . </s>
But frankly , if we can make some of those deals , if we can do some old-fashioned horse trading , and different people may have different views on what deals we should cut , but if we can do that to get them onboard , maybe we will . I think we probably ought to . But we’re never going to know until we suss them out . </s>
Until we go to them and ask them what’s it gon na take . situation , we have to remember this , we’re in a situation where we have offered , not just to talk . You know , we offered to remove our objection to their WTO accession , we gave ‘em spare parts , we lifted pieces of our sanctions . You know , we’ve offered a whole range of things to them . </s>
And so for us to now be in a position where we’re going again to the Iranians and you know , to say to them , okay , well that didn’t work but how about if we do this for you , how about if we do this for you— Each time , the Iranians refuse to take the steps that the international community has said they should take . </s>
Nick and Ken seem to think we oughta go back to them again and say okay , well that wasn’t enough for you , what about this . And I just think that’s a dangerous situation to be in when they are getting closer every day to having a nuclear weapon . the question . The question was what do we do with the Russians and Chinese . </s>
So we’re not talking about constantly going back to the Iranians . What we’re talking is going for the first time to the Russians and the Chinese . But it is a key point , it—you know , if in response to the Iranian intransigence , we decide that we are no longer gon na support the missile defense system , that in fact has helped to protect and will help to protect some of our most important allies in the world against the eventuality , the potential of an Iranian nuclear weapon , that to me is a concession to the Iranians . Now maybe , you know , it’s a concession we’re making to the Russians , but it’s a concession to the Iranians . I would not make those concessions right now either , I agree with Liz on this , I mean you’ve asked a great question . </s>
The Russians and Chinese should be interested in stopping an Iranian nuclear- weapons development program , because of their own interests . I think what’s happened is they haven’t quite believed that we’re ready to give diplomacy a chance , therefore , if we can show a little faith in diplomacy for a little bit of time , I think we’re more likely to get them onboard than otherwise , but I wouldn’t trade the missile defense systems in eastern Europe with the Russians . Question , sir ? to have been on the hot seat all night— Can you start your question again— </s>
Yes— —because your mic was off— …so , I’ll keep you there . </s>
One of the reasons I’m voting for…that the Iran—or the diplomacy is going nowhere , is something that our ally , Israel , had mentioned a few weeks back , and incidentally , I was at the first debate , and no one mentioned Israel at all and they’re the country that had the most to lose , and they’re our friends . My question is when…Prime Minister Netanyahu said the other day in a very undiplomatic way , that if the United States doesn’t take care of this , we are . Now I thought that was shocking . </s>
That indicated , that they think , our diplomacy is sort of 1938 vintage with an umbrella , and a V sign , and it’s going nowhere . </s>
So , if Mr. Netanhayu were here tonight , how would you assure him that he can maintain his confidence in the United States . Thank you , Nick Burns . I’m glad you raised the issue , because we do have to talk about Israel here , I think one of the basic problems that the United States should have with Iran , is the threats that Ahmadinejad has made against the Israeli state and the existence of the Israeli people . And it should be a vital national priority , and it is , for the United States to safeguard Israel , and protect it . And that’s one of our key strategic interests here , how do we best do that . </s>
I fear that if we , if the Israelis launched airstrikes , or if we did , in the next couple of months , we wouldn’t have ever tested the proposition that maybe diplomacy and sanctions backed up by the use of force could work . And we get ourselves into a position where , we’d have the unintended consequences of war , we found out about that in Iraq . We’d have the ability of Iran to use Hezbollah and Hammas asymmetrically to attack Israel , to attack the moderate Palestinians and American interests . And , I’m not aware of a convincing scenario where the use of force actually works . And so , I would just say very respectfully to Prime Minister Netanyahu and he has a right to raise this issue -- he should raise this issue -- that the United States should make a commitment to Israel that we will safeguard its security . </s>
They should allow President Obama , in my judgment , working very closely with Israel , to take the lead , for as long as we think that this diplomatic path can be successful . </s>
There may come a time , when we wan na end diplomacy— Dan— —and go to a tougher option . Dan Senor . I would just , I’d put Prime Minister Netanyahu in the same category that I put all of the regional players , or at least many of them . </s>
Which they are deeply concerned about the mixed signals we’re getting from this administration . </s>
Prime Minister Netanyahu’s saying what he’s saying because he is concerned that the administration is not backing up their diplomatic plan with a credible military threat to solve this problem if it doesn’t go anywhere . That is the same thing that is going on throughout the Persian Gulf and the Arab world , and I take your point , your earlier point , Ken , that it’s very difficult to sort of read exactly what is going on in each one of these Arab societies , but , just the fact that Secretary Gates as Liz said earlier had to travel to Cairo and Riyadh to reassure them , don’t worry , we’re not gon na make this open- ended , and the fact that Dennis Ross has had to bounce around all these capitols to say , don’t misread what we’re try—you know , we’re trying to talk but it’s not gon na — I mean , it gets to a point here where these people are voting , whether it’s Netanyahu or the king of Jordan or the king of Saudi Arabia , or , or the president of Egypt , there is deep concern in the region , and this is a profoundly violent and volatile neighborhood we’re talking about , where wars often start because of misunderstandings and miscommunications and mixed signals , and violent revolutions . And we are dealing with a region right now , which I believe because of the current administration’s lack of clarity about how they intend to back up this diplomatic process , if the Iranians actually ever enter into it , is potential for a very dangerous situation . Sir , your question ? </s>
For clarification on what you mean . </s>
The arguers against the motion , suggest that speaking with Russia and China would be part of diplomacy . Whereas the arguers for the motion , I don’t think they would—they’re thinking of that kind of diplomacy . As I understand the question , is whether we should negotiate or seek diplomacy , with Iran . </s>
Or should just tell Iran to get lost , but , that still reserves the opportunity to talk with Russia and China and try to agree on a sanction . So I’d like you each to define by what you mean by diplomacy , if you’re talking with China and Russia , who do you vote for in this debate . I think we actually , probably all four agree that successful diplomacy can not be bilateral . Now , I don’t…I probably shouldn’t speak for my opponents here but successful diplomacy has got to include countries like Russia and China who actually have relationships with Iran that they could use , they’ve got leverage with Iran that they could use were they to choose to use it . </s>
I think the difference between us , there are two differences between us , one is , I would say , you know , all right , let’s accept for the sake of argument that we can work with Russia and China to try to put tough sanctions in place against the Iranians . There’s no evidence right now that there’s any intent on the part of either Russia or China , to put tough sanctions in place against the Iranians , that piece of this diplomacy is going nowhere . And , I think the second difference is , you know , this question of how much hope do you hold out , after years and years and years , and , you know , Lavrov said to us , you know , within the last six weeks , I don’t wan na have tougher sanctions on the Iranians , I mean we ran into this problem consistently . At the end of the day , the only thing that will get the Russians and the Chinese and some of the other , some of the Europeans onboard with this is if they believe , if they don’t sign up for crippling sanctions the United States will use force . </s>
And right now they don’t believe that . </s>

And we’re actually all friends too . Please don’t let the competitiveness drown that out . </s>
And I wan na ask this question , not to score debating points , ‘cause I think that there is something really interesting going on here and I’ve just been kind of reflecting on it . And this question really kind of brought it to the fore for me and it goes back to the question I raised before but— I wan na put it in a neutral fashion , I don’t want it to be a debating point . </s>
But I do wan na ask this question , because you know , although I am the only Democrat on the panel , I am not speaking for the Obama administration . And as Dan and Liz and I know , I am very glad to disagree with my own party , very publicly , whenever I think it’s necessary . But the question I would like to ask is , what is it that you feel we’re not doing that we should be doing . That would make—‘cause again , I think I’d probably sign up for it , and I just—I wan na hear it . Dan , I can give you 20 seconds— </s>
20 seconds— </s>
—to answer that question— </s>
—okay , I’ll be real quick , but I do wan na commend Ken for taking on his own party from time to time which he’s done on some pretty big issues so I— That was a waste of four seconds— Second—I know . With my— with the balance of my 16 , I will say , if you believe there is a discussion going on right now within the Iranian government between confrontationalists , those who believe that we just need to plow—or the Iranians need to plow ahead and build their nuclear bomb and be quite confrontational , and those that are reformers that believe that , we can cut a deal , the Iranians can cut a deal with the west…we clearly wan na strengthen their hand . And what better way to strengthen their hand than when they’re going into those discussions with the hard- liners than to say , if we don’t act now , while employment is 25 to 30 percent , while our economy’s falling apart , 70 percent of the population is under 30 years old , we could have a revolt here… If the Americans move forward with truly crippling economic sanctions , or potentially military force , this regime will collapse and we will have a total mess on our hands . </s>
That is the kind of leverage we wan na give the reformers in their internal debates with the hard-liners . To say the Americans are lea—left this thing open- ended , they’re having a discussion , we haven’t even returned their phone calls , this is great , the hard-liners aren’t gon na be terribly persuaded that they should , they should be responsive . </s>
That concludes round two of our debate . So we’re now in the final stretch and soon you in the audience will be choosing the winner , recall that , at the start of the debate we asked you whether you took sides with or against this motion , “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere.” Before the debate , it was an even split among the choices , 34 percent of you are for the motion , 33 percent are against , and 33 percent are undecided . And soon we will have you vote one last time , but we are going to go now to our third and final round , each debater is given a brief amount of time , two minutes each , to make a closing statement… And we will begin against the motion , Ambassador Nicholas Burns , former Under- Secretary of State for Political Affairs . Thank you , this has been a terrific debate , and I’ve enjoyed it very much , I like where Dan left off . </s>
The way to get serious draconian sanctions , the only way in my experience and my judgment , is to continue this diplomatic process . Is not to give up on it . Is to bring the Russians and Chinese and Japanese and Arab countries in , the major trading partners , and to convince them to go along with us . I think we face a real threat in Iran . </s>
And we should be very tough-minded and very serious in facing it as Americans . And we should not leave military force out of this . </s>
We should leave that on the table . We should have a threat of sanctions hanging over the Iranians’ heads . But if we give up now , I’m afraid we’ll never know the answer to the question , was peace possible . Did we have the patience and ingenuity and the courage to believe in ourselves , to believe in our ability to be successful at the—at the diplomatic table . </s>
I think we should lead with diplomacy , with the military in reverse . </s>
I’m afraid that if we agree with Liz and Dan’s position , we’re really leading with the military , and we’re forsaking diplomacy . President Obama has just begun his administration . He’s just begun this diplomatic process , which is gon na be quite complex , it’s not gon na go on forever . He needs to be given time , and we need to have the patience as citizens , to let diplomacy play itself out , not forever . </s>
But for—and I think everybody can agree on this . For several months’ time , to test the proposition , that we might find peace , and not find war , I think frankly , that if we just tried war now , and gave up on diplomacy , and either emboldened the Israelis to strike , or struck ourselves , which is the logical conclusion of this position of our opponents , I think it would be unconscionable of us , to go to war , to start a third war , without having given diplomacy a chance . That’s our position , I hope you’ll agree with it . </s>
Thank you , Nick Burns , and summarizing for the motion , “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere , ” Liz Cheney , former State Department official overseeing Mideast policy . </s>
I would venture a guess that I’m somewhere to the right of many people in the audience tonight with one or two notable exceptions . But you don’t have to be as hawkish as I am on this issue to realize that our current diplomatic track with Iran is in fact going nowhere . You really only have to agree with the testimony that Nick gave before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week . In his testimony Nick very helpfully laid out steps that the Obama administration must take in order for diplomacy to go somewhere . </s>
He said , force must be on the table , President Obama needs to prevail upon Iran to freeze its nuclear research as the talks proceed so Iran does not steam ahead unimpeded . President Obama should set a timetable , and finally Nick said , excuse me , that it’ll be crucial that the President agree on the automaticity of sanctions with the P-5 countries , especially Russia and China in advance of the talks . Now I think we probably disagree on whether these steps alone are tough enough to convince the Iranians to give up their weapons . But it is indisputable , that any of these steps are part of our current diplomacy . Therefore , as we debate the issue tonight and as you cast you vote , I would say don’t be swayed by Nick’s division of , you know , vote for them and you’re voting for war and vote for us and you’re voting for peace . </s>
What we’re arguing is that the current diplomacy is ineffective , is going nowhere , because , by Nick’s own definition , it does not include the steps that it needs to include to make diplomacy effective . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Liz Cheney . And , summarizing against the motion , that “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere , ” Kenneth Pollack , Senior Fellow and Director of Research at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy at the Brookings Institution . I think there are two interesting things that are going on right here , in some ways we’re having two separate debates . On the one hand , I’m really heartened by what we’ve all agreed to over the course of the last hour and a half . </s>
I’m really struck by the fact that we all do believe that tough-minded diplomacy really is what this is all about . </s>
And , Liz , while it may be useful in trying to win this debate , I would suggest to you that I—you and I both know Nick pretty well , he’s not contradicting what he said before the Senate . He still believes it , he hasn’t changed his mind over the weekend . And what we’re saying is effectively the same thing . </s>
And so on the one hand , I think that the differences between us may be a matter of semantics , as I suggested it might be a matter of months . </s>
And I think that’s actually really remarkable . And it’s something worth taking away from this . Is that we all are pretty close on this , and what we’re defining as what the right policy is is actually pretty close . At another level though of course , the question as opposed I think raises a very different set of propositions in people’s minds . </s>
And that’s what Nick was trying to get at just a minute ago and I think that it is important to think about . Because while I think that Liz and Dan have been very good about saying , look , we’re not talking about going to war , rushing to war or jumping right into these things , and we want to give diplomacy a chance , it’s just , doing some things differently and , we would come back and say , you know , look , the Obama people have just started , it’s not clear that these things aren’t part of what they’re doing , in fact there’s a lot of evidence to suggest it will be , I mean let’s remember , Hillary Clinton did talk about crippling sanctions against Iran , which was a very important point . </s>
But at the end of the day there are a lot of other people out there who aren’t on this panel , who will say , look at that sentence and say , you’re right , time to go to war . Or time to go to regime change , or something else . And I think that’s what we have to be concerned with . And those people don’t seem to be represented on this panel . </s>
And as far as I’m concerned on the wider debate , the one that isn’t gon na be scored tonight in the US public , that’s the debate that we really have to focus on . Because diplomacy is the right way to handle things , it is the right way to start . If we don’t start there , we’re never gon na end up anywhere that we wan na be . </s>
Thank you , Ken Pollack . And , finally summarizing for the motion , “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere , ” Dan Senor , Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations . I would just close with a couple of quick points . One is a quote that I’ll read that characterized the Iranian leadership in March of 2007 . “President Achmadinejad is reckless , he’s irresponsible , and he’s inattentive to the daily needs of the Iranian people.” </s>
That was not Liz Cheney , that was not Dan Senor , that was then-Senator Obama , in a speech in Chicago , on March 2nd of 2007 . That characterization is probably accurate , and is probably consistent with the history that Liz laid out in her opening . </s>
We don’t know exactly what will push the buttons of the Iranian people , none of us truly know what will push the buttons of the Iranian regime . It is such an opaque society , I went through this with Iraq when there were many experts on all sides of the ideological spectrum who had very strong views about how the Shiites would respond to this and the Sunnis would respond to this and the Kurds would— And , you know , some of them , all of them were— sometimes all of them were wrong and sometimes all of them were right , and as Nick said earlier , when you’re dealing with a society , for three decades we’ve had no communication , no interactions , it is very hard to know what’s going on inside . So all we have to base this debate on is the history that we’re aware of , which Liz went through in her opening statement . The actual public statements of the leadership of the country which should count for something , and the rhetoric they have used with regard to Israel and the United States and the west is apocalyptic . And thirdly , their capabilities . </s>
The capability that they are trying to develop , right now , in defiance of UN Security Council resolutions , and in defiance of our effort to reach out to them . </s>
That is a dangerous , toxic combination . Their history of non-negotiation and stalling , combined with the public statements about what they would do , the genocidal rhetoric they , they articulate , that , they say they would use genocidal weapons for , and finally , the capability that they are trying to pursue . So— Dan Senor , I’m sorry , your time is up . A dip— </s>
I’ll give you 10 more seconds— A diplomatic process is fine , as long as we are clear and we can make clear to the Iranians , where it ends , and how strongly we back up the alternative course in our negotiations . And that concludes round three of our debate , we will now have you pick our winner , recall that at the beginning of the debate , we were more evenly split than we have ever been at any of our debate series , 34 percent of you are for the motion coming in , 33 percent again , and 33 percent undecided , if you pick up your keypads , they are live now . </s>
Vote 1 if you are for the motion , 2 if at this point you are against , and 3 if you remain undecided . So…we’re locking that out , and we are now just a couple of minutes away from declaring the winner , a couple of things we wan na make announcements about , given that this is the end of our third season , everyone at Intelligence Squared is very grateful to those of you who have continued to show support and enthusiasm for these debates . We also want to extend a warm thank you to the Rockefeller University for the use of this auditorium , Caspary Auditorium , throughout the season . </s>
We want you to know that ticket packages and individual tickets for next season , Fall 2009 , and Spring 2010 series are on sale now , right now , through our website . The Fall debate dates and topics are these , on Monday September 21st , the topic is “Buy American/Hire American policies will backfire.” On Tuesday , October 6th , “Pakistan , not Afghanistan , is America’s real problem.” Tuesday , October 27th , “Good riddance to mainstream media.” Tried to slip that… Monday , November 16th , “Obama’s economic policies are working effectively”… Tuesday , December 1st , “America is to blame for Mexico’s drug war.” </s>
All of our debates will continue to be heard on more than 185 NPR stations across the country . And all five debates will now be covered by the Bloomberg Television network . To accommodate the television production and our growing audience we will be moving next season to a new venue downtown , we will be at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at NYU . And now more exciting news… More exciting news . </s>
Intelligence Squared US , is very , very pleased to announce , a new partnership , a media partnership with Newsweek magazine and here to help me with that is Newsweek CEO Tom Ascheim . Tom ? John . I’m here to kill the time while we count the votes . </s>
That was really thrilling , thank you all very much , it was great entertainment and I think really a great exemplar of what we are looking forward to in partnering with Intelligence Squared . I’m sorry , I have dastardly allergies so you’re hearing me sound like a frog , I apologize . We are incredibly excited about the opportunity to really embed the content from these debates in both our magazine and our website going forward . They are on issues of incredible importance , not least the future of mainstream media I’d like to point out . </s>
When we were first introduced to Intelligence Squared it was very clear that we had an enormous amount in common , perhaps most pertinently that we both love to see a great fight started , and it makes for really good content for all of us . There’s really no better time for us to be having this partnership , Intelligence Squared is expanding , it’s gon na be great to see it downtown . And we are already launching the very fabric that is Newsweek , on Monday the magazine is being reborn in a new form and a new way , I hope you will all check it out as well as the website as well as the brand in general , so , we look forward to a great partnership— Tom— Bob , thank you very much . </s>
Tom , thank you . Right . Thank you , Tom . </s>
And now to declare the winner , you voted before the debate on whether you agree or disagree with our motion that “Diplomacy with Iran is going nowhere , ” you have now voted again and here we go , before the debate , 34 percent of you were for the motion , 33 percent against , 33 percent were undecided , remember when I raise my hand I will need applause . Here are the results , after the debate . 35 percent are for the motion , 59 percent are now against the motion— 6 percent are undecided , congratulations to the side arguing against the motion , and of course to the art of persuasion itself , for me , John Donvan , and Intelligence Squared , thank you . null Good evening , everyone , and welcome . </s>
I’m Robert Rosenkranz , chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate Forum , which is an initiative of the Rosenkranz Foundation . It’s a very special pleasure for me to welcome you today to our inaugural debate of our inaugural season . </s>
With this series of live debates , and with our national radio audience , we’re pursuing a lofty and ambitious goal . </s>
We’re trying to raise the level of public discourse in American life . We see a Congress that’s mired in partisan rancor , we see much of the media increasingly ideological . We see policy intellectuals in the think-tank world preaching to their respective choirs , and the discussion of contentious policy issues everywhere , dominated by intense emotions , rather than by facts and reasoned analysis . But Intelligence Squared is not about the search for bland middle ground . </s>
Rather , we want to encourage each side of an argument to sharpen its own thinking by listening to opposing views , and responding to inconvenient facts . We want our audience , who voted on tonight’s resolution coming in , to vote again after hearing the debate . As our great Judge Pierre LeBeau said , “You know you have a mind , when you change it.” </s>
Whether or not you change your mind , I hope you’ll come away with the recognition that there is an intellectually respectable position on the other side . For that is the real point of our initiative . We want to promote a civil society in America that is truly civil—where we increase our respect for opposing views , we reduce our anger and emotion , and we call on the best within ourselves , as we confront the challenging issues of our day . We’re thrilled that WNYC is recording our series of debates , and that through National Public Radio , you’ll be able to hear this debate in most of the major cities across the country on local NPR stations . My wife Alexandra Munroe commissioned the study that was the first concrete step in this initiative , and she has made invaluable contributions every step of the way . </s>
We value the sponsorship of the Times of London , their support , and indeed the excellence of the debates themselves is part of a team effort . I want to especially thank our moderator Robert Siegel , the voice of “All Things Considered , ” and the extraordinary group of panelists who are the true stars of tonight’s event . But one individual merits special acknowledgement—our executive producer , Dana Wolfe , a former “ABC News Nightline” producer who brought extraordinary determination , intelligence , and experience to this project . </s>
Thank you , Dana . I’d like to close by quoting two political leaders , one American , one British . Al Gore , at the Clinton Global Initiative last week , speaking on the subject of global warming as a crisis , said , “The debate is over.” </s>
And now , Margaret Thatcher . “I love argument . I love debate . I don’t expect anyone to just sit there and agree with me . </s>
that’s not their job.” </s>
Well , at the risk of showing my own partisanship , I’d like to declare a victory for Britain . Of course Oxford-style debate is a long and vigorous tradition in Britain , and Intelligence Squared was founded in London , where it’s an esteemed institution and a major success . There it attracts a live audience of 800 of London’s most influential figures . I’m honored to welcome the founders , media entrepreneurs Jeremy O’Grady , and John Gordon , and pass the microphone over to John , who will share his thoughts and introduce our moderator for the evening . Thank you very much , Robert . </s>
We’re absolutely delighted that Intelligence Squared has come to America thanks to the Rosenkranz Foundation . It’s great for the baby that Jeremy O’Grady and I have been nurturing for 25 or more years and that we created four years ago has now come over the pond . </s>
] Intelligence Squared in London has really taken off . Everyone there loves debate and even though it’s very much part of our tradition , it’s not very much a part of the tradition in London -- there isn’t any regular series of debates other than Intelligence Squared . I hope this evening you’ll enjoy the two particular pleasures I think that we enjoy from the debate , one is that , this is probably the first time that you’ll have the opportunity to hear oratory . </s>
I mean there is very seldom—few outlets where you can hear somebody speaking for eight or nine minutes in trying to persuade you to vote for or against a particular motion . </s>
And I think the other great sort of pleasure of debate , which again I’m sure you’ll experience this evening—particularly if you’re undecided as to the motion—is the great pleasure of hearing the proposer arguing the motion , agreeing with them , and then eight minutes later actually agreeing with the other side . And it’s that intellectual ping-pong that is particularly exciting . We’ve been slightly surprised by the enormous take-up of Intelligence Squared , there’s been a vast amount of interest from companies around the world interviewing us , writing articles about it . </s>
It’s almost sort of emblematic of the stereotypes of various countries , for example the French who have written about it and interviewed us , are particularly surprised by the fact that the speakers who are normally extremely rude to each other in English debate end up going out to dinner with each other . The Germans who’ve interviewed us twice and written an article in Der Spiegel , were actually surprised by debate , full stop . As a consensual society they’ve just never really sort of experienced the idea of debate . And the Japanese , with whom we did an interview on Tokyo FM very recently , a live interview to 20 million people , in the course of the interview it was clear that they completely misunderstood what we were doing . They asked us , how many people have gotten married during the course of a meeting . </s>
They rather thought we were a dating agency . </s>
So we’re rather curious to see how you are going to respond to this very quintessential British sport of adversarial debate . I’d like now to hand over the microphone to our very distinguished moderator this evening , Robert Siegel . </s>
Robert is a senior host of National Public Radio’s award-winning evening news magazine , “All Things Considered.” He got started in radio news when he was a college freshman in 1964 , and he’s still at it . As a host , Robert has reported from Europe , the Middle East and all over the United States . </s>
He served for four years as director of NPR’s news and information department . I’m now very pleased to turn the evening over to Robert for the debate , “We must tolerate a nuclear Iran.” Thank you . Thank you , John Gordon , for your introduction , and I’d like to welcome all of you to the inaugural Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I’d like to begin with some housekeeping . </s>
First the obligatory announcement at all public gatherings— could you please turn off your cell phones , pagers , PDA’s , things that beep , talking toys or whatever else you might have with you tonight , that might interrupt the debate . Also , if you have something that you might be tempted to unwrap in the course of the evening , this is being recorded for broadcast in radio , and the sound of wrapping paper crinkling is often a substitute for crackling fire , or it was in the old days . So please do the unwrapping now , before we begin . I’d like to explain the proceedings , what’s going to happen this evening . First , the proposer of the motion will start by proposing that side of the argument , and the opposition will follow . </s>
We will alternate from the pro to the con side , each presentation being eight minutes . I’ll be the time cop , and I’ll give them two-minute and one-minute warnings , and if they keep on talking , I’ll tell you to turn your cell phones back on and interrupt them . After all six speakers have spoken and finished , we’ll then have a question-and-answer session in which we will welcome your questions , and also your brief statements , and they will respond to you . When that question-and-answer session is complete , each debater will make a final statement lasting no more than two minutes . </s>
Now , during the closing statements we then come to this perforated ballot-ticket that you were given on the way in . </s>
You were asked as you entered whether you were for or against the motion or undecided , and once again we will ask you , after you’ve heard from all of our speakers , to vote again , and you will do that in a manner I’ll describe . If you don’t have one of these now , we’ll take care of that when the time comes and the usher will provide you with a ballot . Then after we’ve heard all the closing statements , we shall announce the results of both the poll that we took on the way in , and also the voting after you’ve heard these , what I hope will be very interesting and persuasive presentations . I’d like to introduce our panel right now . </s>
First , those who support and propose the notion that we must tolerate a nuclear Iran . George Perkovich is a U.S. foreign policy expert and vice-president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . </s>
Welcome . </s>
Karim Sadjadpour , formally based in Tehran , is a writer and Iran analyst for the International Crisis Group . Sanam Vakil is assistant professor of Middle East Studies at Johns Hopkins University’s School of Advanced International Studies . That’s the side that proposes the motion we’re going to hear debated . To my left this evening , are Patrick Clawson , who is an author and also deputy director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , Reuel Marc Gerecht , an expert in Middle East affairs , formerly with the CIA , currently a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research , and best-selling author and co-founder/editor of the Washington-based political magazine The Weekly Standard , William Kristol . </s>
Bill Kristol rounds out our panel . So let us start the debate , proposing the motion , “We must tolerate a nuclear Iran , ” George Perkovich , please take the podium . we can return to that in the question part . </s>
It’s an evening event , everybody’s tired from work . To judge the motion , “We must tolerate a nuclear Iran , ” you must evaluate the alternatives to it . Ideally , the United States and other leading actors can prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons . </s>
Indeed , all six of us here agree emphatically that the U.S. and the international community must do everything possible , and more than has been done already , to try to prevent this . We all agree with that , we all work on that much of our time . We can talk about some of the steps that that might entail , including the United States being willing to engage in direct negotiations with Iran if Iran is willing to do so , which is a big question . </s>
We should talk about security guarantees to Iran , which Patrick has written about in the form of , “We will not attack you if you don’t attack us.” We should right now be mustering Iran’s neighbors— perhaps secretly , some of it openly—into a much tighter , cohesive network to try to cooperate on intelligence , air monitoring , perhaps moving ballistic missile defenses into the region , to show Iran that its freedom of maneuver will be diminished if it moves forward with nuclear weapons . We have to be much more direct with President Putin in Russia . </s>
Russia is the biggest impediment of getting the Security Council to take strong actions , and we can talk about that later . The general point is , prevention , all of us agree , is the best option . Yet prevention is not the proposition we’ve been asked to debate here tonight . The question we are debating , is whether we can tolerate a nuclear Iran . </s>
That question assumes that diplomacy has failed , and we’re on to other options . Then we have to ask , well , what are the alternatives to tolerating an Iran that possesses nuclear weapons . Well , one might say , well , we kill ourselves . If we can’t tolerate , we kill ourselves . That’s not a good option . </s>
The second option will be , well , we’ll kill all of them . Make the problem go away . Also not a good option , there are 74 million of them , three times the population of Iraq . Even if somehow it were morally justifiable , it wouldn’t necessarily solve the problem . </s>
The most feasible strategy that is the alternative , the most feasible strategy for not tolerating a nuclear Iran , is an attack—a combination of attack on its known nuclear facilities , on its air force and navy to try to prevent its capacity to retaliate immediately , and on the Revolutionary Guard , to try to hasten regime change . This ought to be examined , and there are a long list of questions that arise from this . But the key thing in terms of the motion before us is , that you should not assume that this is a question of will power . In other words , if one says , “I will not tolerate a nuclear Iran , ” that somehow that solves the problem , that the will power to act—meaning to conduct a war—somehow achieves the objective of eliminating Iran’s nuclear capability . </s>
There’s no reason actually to conclude that it would—that even if you had the will , you could eliminate that capability . </s>
But you have to factor that in , as well as the consequences of a potential action . Now if I thought that a military attack of this type I described would actually eliminate that nuclear capability , and do it for a sufficient time , I would be for it , if the consequences of our attack were not going to leave us worse off . </s>
But to conclude that the consequences won’t leave us worse off , you have to ask a bunch of questions . </s>
To his great credit , Reuel Gerecht , our colleague , has written an essay last April in the Weekly Standard , that’s a very detailed treatment of a military option , which he ultimately advocates . Reuel talks about a campaign , a military campaign , that he says would be “a series of actions and counter- actions between the U.S. and Iran , that would probably transpire over many years , perhaps a decade or more.” Now there’s a long list of questions that arise when you contemplate a war with Iran lasting a decade or more . </s>
You’d have to know if we buy some time , maybe two or three years , in the first attack , what happens . Well , the most likely thing that happens is the inspectors have to go , that’s been our major source of intelligence . So now when you want to figure out what else to attack over these years , your capacity actually to pinpoint things has diminished . The probability of hitting false targets , wrong targets , killing innocent people , being subjected to media treatments then of the mistaken bombing , goes up , and with each mistaken bomb , U.S. credibility in the world , in the region , in Iran , is diminished . There are other questions . </s>
What are the odds then an air war will improve the prospects for democracy in Iran ? What are the odds that another war will make Iran less threatening to the U.S. and Israel ? What are the odds that another war led by the United States will increase America’s capacity to solve the other problems in the world—Iraq , Afghanistan , the war on terror , international trade ? You name the issues , will our credibility be enhanced if we conduct another war in the Middle East ? </s>
Now Reuel wrote his essay before the war in Lebanon . I would argue that war has even further raised the bar , the difficulty , of thinking that a war against Iran will actually solve this problem . We believe that another war would leave the United States and the world worse off than we would be by pursuing an alternative strategy . </s>
If you agree , you should vote in favor of the resolution . We argue there’s plenty of evidence to conclude that if more energetic efforts to prevent Iran from getting nuclear— </s>
Two minutes— —fail , it will still be possible to deter and contain Iran from using nuclear weapons against anyone . Iran’s president is alarming , he is indeed alarming . But the leadership in Iran is collective , and it includes many old men . These old men did not get old by being suicidal . </s>
Iran , Persia , has thousands of years of grand history , and there’s no reason whatsoever to think that Iranian nationalists would sacrifice their nation and their civilization in a nuclear war of their making . There is other evidence of Iran’s deterability . Iran has not attacked the weaker United Arab Emirates with which it has a dispute over two resource-rich islands . Iran did not attack the Sunni extremist Taliban government in Afghanistan , even when that government killed , murdered , nine Iranian diplomats . One minute . </s>
Iran has a Jewish population that is free to leave but chooses not to . There is no evidence that Iran is not deterable . Indeed , as Reuel has written , “The Islamic republic ceased to produce holy warriors by the end of the Iran-Iraq War in 1988 . The potential for chiliastic rapture has just dried up.” </s>
The bigger point is this . </s>
Voting for the motion does not mean doing nothing , or turning the other cheek to Iran . Voting for the motion means deciding that another war will not solve this problem , and that a robust , extremely tough strategy of deterrence and containment would be the most effective way to keep a nuclear Iran from threatening the United States and its friends . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , George Perkovich , for proposing the motion before us , “We must tolerate a nuclear Iran.” And now to the podium we call the first opponent of that motion , Patrick Clawson . I thought George gave a very eloquent statement of why we should not go to war with Iran , and if that were the proposition that we were debating , I think his arguments were spot-on . </s>
That however is not the proposition we’re debating . </s>
The proposition we’re debating is that we should not tolerate a nuclear Iran . That’s quite a different matter . In fact , there are many things that we could do , even if Iran got a nuclear weapon , that would suggest to me that we would have non-military ways in order to persuade Iran to give up that weapon . Most of the countries of the world which developed—which had nuclear weapons have given them up , and not through war . </s>
So there are in fact many things that we can do , that would show we can not tolerate a nuclear Iran , short of war . So I would rather spend my time discussing the proposition as stated to you , namely that we can not tolerate a nuclear Iran , rather than discussing whether or not to go to war with Iran . I would like to suggest that when it comes to a nuclear Iran , the proposition is very well-stated , because it leaves vague exactly what do we mean . Are we talking about the nuclear family in Iran ? Or what are we talking about here ? </s>
I for one have no objections if Iranians care to choose to live in nuclear families . But what we are likely to have is a very gray case . We in fact do not have a smoking gun to show that Iran has a nuclear weapons program . </s>
It’s unlikely that we’re going to wake up some morning to find that Iran has exploded a nuclear weapon . </s>
What we have to deal with instead , is what Iran openly declares that it is doing—namely building this complicated thing called a nuclear fuel cycle , to make the materials for having a nuclear weapon . The Iranians themselves have described well why they’re doing this . In a remarkable speech , their chief negotiator for their nuclear weapons program wrote that having a fuel-cycle capability almost means the country that possesses this capability is able to produce nuclear weapons , should that country have the political will to do so . Now that’s the judgment of the Iranian government . The Nobel Peace Prize-winning head of the International Atomic Energy Agency , Mohammed Al Baradei—who you may recall was no friend of George Bush on the Iraq matter—says that if Iran does what Iran announces it’s intending to do , that Iran will be , quote , “a few months , ” end quote , away from having a nuclear weapon . </s>
So our real question is , do we want to see Iran have that kind of a capability , on the edge of having a nuclear weapon but not quite there . </s>
We’re not going to have the dramatic moment where Iran explodes a nuclear weapon necessarily . If we need to act , we need to act much before then . We need to act when Iran is getting this capability to make the essential elements for a nuclear weapon . </s>
That is what we have to concentrate on stopping . </s>
Indeed , why do I think that that is something that not only we can not tolerate , but we need not tolerate . Let me count some of the reasons . </s>
First is that what the Iranians are doing , is exploiting a loophole in the system that we have constructed to make sure that the world does not have a hundred countries with nuclear weapons . </s>
The Iranians have correctly identified a real weakness in our system of stopping the spread of nuclear weapons . Indeed , Muhammad Al Baradei has proposed a five- year moratorium on the construction of all fuel-cycle facilities worldwide , and has said that any such facility should be under international control , because the technology is so dangerous . If Iran gets away with building this , it will not be the only country . </s>
We will not only have to tolerate a nuclear Iran , we will have to tolerate a nuclear Turkey , a nuclear Egypt , a nuclear Saudi Arabia . </s>
A nuclear Algeria . </s>
A nuclear Venezuela . </s>
A nuclear South Africa . A nuclear Brazil . </s>
When we start having 20 or 30 countries with nuclear weapons , and we start having a multiple system of deterrence , it’s going to be very interesting if we have to go through the Cuban Missile Crisis another 20 or 30 or 40 times . </s>
I’m not confident it’ll turn out so positively every time . I don’t think that deterrence is something that we can count on working every time , the way it did work with the Soviets , once the Soviets got so tired and Brezhnev took over , and couldn’t care less about revolution . But in any case , I say we can not tolerate a nuclear Iran , because if we tolerate a nuclear Iran , we will be tolerating many , many more nuclear countries , and that is not something that will lead to peace in the world . </s>
Furthermore , we need not tolerate a nuclear Iran , because there is much that we can do to stop it without having to talk about going to war . The fact is that Iran has acknowledged to the International Atomic Energy Agency that it’s been carrying out these clandestine nuclear activities for 18 years . </s>
But they haven’t gotten very far . Now , a lot of that has broadcast our success , in fact having a system which does limit what Iran can do . We have had a lot of successes in our efforts in stopping Iran’s program . </s>
You may recall that we were very worried when the Soviet Union fell apart that its scientists and nuclear matter would show up around the world , causing proliferation . We started a big program called the Nunn-Lugar Program to prevent that . And in fact , none of it has shown up in Iraq . </s>
None of it . Indeed , the Iranians have had to , on the whole , do things themselves . The only thing that they were able to buy was a set of blueprints from A.Q . Khan of Pakistan . </s>
I don’t know about you , but I can’t assemble furniture from Ikea when I buy it with the blueprints . </s>
I certainly can’t program my VCR with the instructions that come with it . So buying a set of blueprints didn’t really get the Iranians necessarily that far ahead . Indeed , that’s why their program has taken 18 years , and is going very slowly . President Ahmadinejad of Iran claimed this last spring that they were going to have— Two minutes— </s>
—3,000 centrifuges up and operational by the end of the year . I don’t think he’s going to have 300 . </s>
And we can , by reinforcing our system of controls on Iran’s access to advanced technology , by mobilizing the world community , slow down Iran’s program dramatically . To the point where Iran might be able to make one bomb , but I don’t think it’ll be able to make a lot of bombs , and it certainly won’t have a way to deliver that thing . And if this bomb ends up being some two-ton monstrosity that they can barely fit into a bread truck , then they won’t have easy ways of delivering this thing . </s>
So , there are always ways in which the control on technologies makes the real difference . That’s why we should continue our efforts to limit Iran’s access to these advanced technologies , rather than tolerating a nuclear Iran and saying , well , now you’re in the nuclear club . </s>
Okay , join the club , you can do what you want . No . </s>
We should , even if Iran’s program progresses dramatically , continue to press them , continue to work on them— One minute— —and not tolerate it . </s>
Furthermore , as George laid out at the end of his presentation , there are excellent reasons to think that , in fact , the Iranian government is pretty cautious , in spite of this Ahmadinejad of the moment . On the whole , right now the Iranians think that they’re on top of the world and the strategic situation’s very good for them . </s>
But that too will change , and our job is to press them , press them so that the cautious element— which I entirely agree with George is very much there in the leadership—comes to the fore , and the Iranians decide that this thing too risky , it’s not good for Iran’s security , and we can get them to stop this program , or if the program’s advanced a long way , we can get them to reverse it . Most of the countries that have had nuclear weapons have given them up . </s>
So we do not have to tolerate a nuclear Iran , we can get them to stop , or if necessary to reverse . Thank you , Patrick Clawson . We now turn to the proponents once again , and to Sanam Vakil . Thank you . </s>
It’s a pleasure to be here tonight to tell you why we must tolerate a nuclear Iran . It’s time for the United States to rewrite the balance of power . Iran has been using its nuclear program to bolster its legitimacy , domestically in Iran , regionally in the Middle East , and internationally , And this tactic is coming at the expense of American credibility and influence in these arenas . So by engaging Iran over its nuclear program , Washington can take this tool of coercion out of Tehran’s hands , and once again have a larger degree of influence as well as credibility within Iran , within the region of the Middle East , and internationally . Let me tell you how Tehran is using its nuclear program to its advantage . </s>
Let me start with the domestic . By engaging , the U.S. would prevent the Iranian regime from using the nuclear program as a pretext for regime preservation . Through its domestic policies , Tehran has advanced its power under the guise of this program . The administration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is tactically manipulating its nationalistic nuclear ambitions to foster support domestically . Important though , is if you ask the average Iranian , what is nuclear energy , or what is uranium enrichment , they wouldn’t be able to tell you . </s>
This is what the government has homed in on . They’ve been able to exploit the double standards that exist within the international community , vis-à-vis Iran’s nuclear program , compared to India’s , Pakistan’s , North Korea’s , and even Israel’s . This is what the government draws strength . An edict was issued roughly six months ago through the National Security Council preventing negative media from being reported on nuclear issues domestically , and the government uses censorship of media to control popular access to any nuclear-related information , among other information as well . </s>
This way , the government has been successful in perpetuating nuclear nationalism , and controlling the effect of that nationalism . For Iran , the nuclear issue is linked to the nation’s place in the modern world , national pride , and resistance against the West . </s>
An effort to prevent Iran’s program from advancing is further associated to discrimination , and perpetuated by fears of sanctions and regime change . </s>
More interestingly , as I observed this summer during my visit to Tehran , Ahmadinejad has more support throughout Tehran today and in other cities on foreign policy issues than he did last year after he was surprisingly elected . </s>
This is due to his confrontational approach , compared to the policy of détente that was pursued under the Hatami administration . You might ask why . That’s because many Iranians feel quite happy and proud that he has taken on the nuclear portfolio and succeeded in garnering more concessions for Iran , compared to what was going on during the tenure of President Hatami . So these confrontational tactics are also domestic tactics pursued by the government , acts of deflection to perpetuate a constant state of fear domestically , with regards to sanctions and even a military strike , and these tactics are designed to strengthen the hand of the regime and the unclear program . </s>
This is why we should tolerate a nuclear Iran . </s>
We should think about the Iranians at home that have to suffer under the regime . </s>
The same time , the government is using the opportunity of the nuclear threat to launch a domestic crackdown on elites within the system . They’ve closed down reformist newspapers . </s>
They’re purging universities of secular academics . </s>
They’re detaining students . They’re purging bureaucrats from the system . All in an effort to silence opposition , and all under the paradigm and all under the guise of the nuclear program . The regime is ever more united in the face of opposition . Let’s also consider a counter-factual . </s>
If we do not tolerate Iran’s unclear program , we are playing into the hands of Ahmadinejad . He dreams of becoming a war president . Why was he elected ? He was elected on an economic platform . </s>
He was elected to be a populistic President . But since he’s been in power for the past year , he has yet to meet the demands of the people , and he has been pursuing foreign policy issues , not economic ones . Any nuclear strike , military strike , or sanctions would give him just cause for continuing to neglect his electoral mandate . </s>
So let me offer you even one more final reason why we should tolerate a nuclear Iran on the domestic agenda . The government is further playing to these domestic nationalistic sentiments of the Iranian street , and playing up against the Iranian street that has historically been very pro-American . They’re using their imagery of the war , and they’re using fear of sanctions and regime change to change the sentiment in Iran against the United States , and this is a huge loss for Washington . </s>
Let’s turn to the region . </s>
Ahmadinejad has also exploited the nuclear issue to no end . This issue has gained a lot of support among the Arab and Muslim street . He’s spoken of the double standards that exist among U.S. policies in the Middle East . He’s taken on the plight of the Palestinians , challenging the order in the recent war this summer , and he’s earned praise in capitols from Cairo to Jakarta . </s>
There’s also a credible— Two minutes— </s>
—threat of proxy war . It’s a notable one , and the regime has cultivated relations with proxies to counterbalance the very large American presence in the region with two unfinished wars on Iran’s borders . So Tehran’s message is simple—it’s a regime not to be reckoned with . The U.S. is in a weakened position in Iraq , Palestine , Lebanon , Afghanistan , and with this growing conflict within the religion of Islam . Tehran is exploiting this to its advantage , drawing on the Arab street for support at the expense of the United States . </s>
Internationally . The regime’s confrontational regional and domestic approach of the nuclear program has also divided and weakened the international community at Washington’s expense . Unable to unite the international community and drive a consensus on sanctions , only weakens Washington’s position further . </s>
Jacques Shirac recently defected , and China and Russia are unable to back Washington— One minute— —on any sanctions in this nuclear jockeying that’s going back and forth . Let’s compare Ahmadinejad . </s>
He’s able to rally 118 NAM nations to support Iran’s ambitions , and the United States can’t rally the P-5 and the Security Council ? That’s depressing . So , Ahmadinejad says he supports dialogue , let’s take him up on this offer . </s>
I leave you with this . </s>
The U.S. is losing the Iranian street , it’s moving into dangerous territory in the Arab and Muslim world , and it’s losing support in the Security Council . Let’s take the lever away from Tehran . Let’s not allow them to exploit their nuclear program at our expense anymore . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Sanam Vakil . Our next speaker , opposing the motion , is Reuel Marc Gerecht . Bigotry against tall men . I just want to start off by thanking George for using my own words against me . I sort of had the sensation of arguing with my wife and I inevitably lose those encounters . </s>
I will suggest that perhaps he maybe used some of my words a little selectively . I mean , I think Patrick handled the geo-strategic issues rather well , I’m not going to go back over those . I also am not going to go over a point- counterpoint on the individual repercussions of a bombing run . I did that , as George said , at great length in a Weekly Standard piece and there’s no reason for me to torture any of you here who read it the first time through . </s>
But I will focus on a couple of issues which I think tend to get overlooked , particularly in American and Europe audiences . When I hear the other side talking , I hear them talking about Iran as if it’s a status quo country . </s>
I almost never hear them talk about God . </s>
I almost never hear them talk about the religious inspiration that still fuels the regime at the very top . What people have been anticipating inside of the Islamic republic for the longest period of time , is that it would go thermidor . They thought it with Rafsanjani , who by the way should really be considered the father of the Iranian nuclear weapon . </s>
They thought it with him , even though at the very same time he was unleashing the Intelligence Ministry , the Revolutionary Guard Corps and assassination teams and bombing teams that went around the world in the 1980s and ‘90s . They thought it about Rafsanjani when he was calling these ecumenical movements , bringing in Sunni militants into Tehran on a regular basis and having outreach programs . </s>
By the way , Ayman al-Zawahiri , Al Qaeda’s number two , has been probably Tehran’s favorite poster boy for over 20 years . I will just add there’s something deeply suspicious about members of Al Qaeda moving through Iran before 9-11 and moving through Iran after 9-11 . </s>
It’s also very unusual for individuals who are under house arrest in Tehran to be placing cell phone calls to operational units of Al Qaeda in Saudi Arabia . </s>
That is not the usual routine that people have when they’re under house arrest . </s>
I think we have to understand that absolutely , when you deal with the vast majority of Iranian people , certainly Iranian men—these are the ones we’re primarily talking about—that that chiliastic drive that you saw in the 1980s , they were really the mothership of much of the jihadism mentality that we see today transferred over to the Sunni world , it’s dead . It died . If nothing else it died with the end of Khomeini who was sort of the charismatic inspiration . Unfortunately for the hardcore and for the elite , it’s not dead . I would argue it is as alive today as it was before . </s>
That doesn’t mean , once again , that you will not find individuals in that league who can not be , quote , quite pragmatic . I was quite struck by the commentary of the fellow on CBS , the very , very old fellow , who went to interview Ahmadinejad and he said he seemed like a very rational man . That is I think a very Western comment , because we have this sort of false juxtaposition that individuals of die-hard belief and faith can not be rational . They absolutely are . </s>
I mean Khomeini was a very , very rational man , he had a certain love of Neoplatonism that people don’t talk about but he was a more or less rational man . The same is true of Ahmadinejad but Ahmadinejad is a die-hard believer . So by the way is Khomeini , so by the way I would argue is Rafsanjani . </s>
What we have to worry about , is in fact that the anti-Americanism at that level has not diminished . You have to think , do you want to do what is necessary to try to stop them from getting nuclear weaponry , because you’re not primarily talking about an exchange of nuclear weapons being a firing-off between the United States and Iran . The Iranians realize that will probably end up very badly for them . What are you interested in is , will this give them an umbrella for protection of terrorism . </s>
I think if you look at the Western track record dealing with the clerical regime , that you have to say we’ve done a very poor job of responding to them . In many ways we have been at war with the Islamic republic since its inception , except we have not responded . They have bombed , they have attacked , they have killed American soldiers , we did not respond . I suggest to you that what you’re going to see life they get nuclear weapons is a new inspiration , I think it’s already out there , and I would expect that Ahmadinejad is once again trying to do what Khomeini and Rafsanjani had tried in the 1980s and failed . </s>
That was to lead the radical Islamic world on a new anti- American jihad . I think you’re going to see them try to do it again , and the acquisition of nuclear weapon is a key to that element . </s>
It is their safeguard , it is their protection . Once they have that I would argue that in fact the odds of them being able to strike the United States through proxies or directly will go up astronomically . Should you take that risk ? I would say no , that you have to say , do you want to give individuals who run what I would call sort of a more sophisticated version of bin Ladinism , do you want to let them have the nuke ? </s>
I would say under no circumstances . Is it worthwhile to take the repercussion from that in Afghanistan , which I don’t think are that much , in Iraq , and I might add , the way Iraq is going it’s going to be so bad— </s>
Two minutes— —it’s going to be very difficult for the Iranians to try to make a difference . If you are willing to absorb the repercussion of that , I would say yes , absolutely , the nightmare scenarios that you would have when you have this hardcore elite , which I would argue will become more and more radical . </s>
Because in fact the vast majority of Iranians have sheared away from the visions and the dreams and the promises of the Islamic revolution . They are not going in the direction of their citizenry , would that they were . They’re going in the opposite direction . The people inside of that regime , particularly I would argue the most important people , the clergy , the dissident clergy that I would argue are still the hope for that regime in the future , have in fact lost ground if not been completely stuffed . </s>
I would agree with Sanam that public diplomacy is a very good idea . </s>
The United States should try to wage as best a public diplomacy as possible . But public diplomacy is not going to— One minute— </s>
—the nuclear weapons issue . Would that we actually could improve our position inside Iran , and I would just add by the way , the United States has a far better position inside that country , and it has maintained a relatively , if not pretty seriously hostile position against the Islamic republic now for over 25 years , while the Europeans have constantly tried to use engagement , yet their position inside of Iran I think is far , far less . </s>
Hostility towards the clerical regime has not cost us inside that country , it has in fact gained us a following . So you have to decide , are you willing to take a really serious risk , and I would add just tactically , you have to say yes . Because diplomacy you know isn’t going to work unless you threaten the possibility , you have to be serious about it , of using military strikes . The only reason the Europeans—and they will tell you that if you talk to the Germans and the French and the British— Time is up , Reuel . </s>
Time’s up ? We’ll hear from the Europeans later I think . </s>
Thank you very much , Reuel Marc Gerecht . </s>
Now our third and final speaker in support of the motion , and that is Karim Sadjadpour . </s>
Okay . Thank you so much for coming , it’s really a privilege to be here and it’s a privilege to be personally speaking for Bill Kristol . It’s a big privilege and a big challenge . When I was in high school my father used to watch the Sunday morning talk shows . My favorite guest was always Bill Kristol because he was always so thoughtful and sensible and sensitive , I just assumed he was a liberal . </s>
I must admit I was a late bloomer intellectually . </s>
I would just like to first start off by reiterating the point that George made , that I think all six of us here are after the same thing at the end of the day—an Iran which is democratic , which is free , which is prosperous , and which is not armed with a nuclear weapon . That would be the ideal option . So the question is not whether or not the Islamic republic is a cruel regime . It is , I can tell you as someone who has been detained in Tehran by the Revolutionary Guard , it is a cruel regime . </s>
The question is not , again , why or whether or not Iran should have a nuclear weapon we should tolerate . I think personally it would be disastrous if they were to acquire a nuclear weapon . </s>
But the question on our panel is , should we tolerate it , and that begs the question , should we go to war with Iran to prevent it . Which cost would be higher , to actually accept Iran acquiring a nuclear weapon , or going to war with them to prevent it . I would suggest that the latter option would be far more dangerous , bombing Iran to prevent it from acquiring a nuclear . I’m a bit surprised tonight that the other side of the table is seeming to—I’m a bit too junior to contradict them too much—but they’re running away from the argument somewhat because both Reuel and Bill are on the record saying that they would bomb Iran . So hopefully , we hear that from Bill in the next round . </s>
I would just argue similar to what Sanam said , that if Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was here tonight , he would be arguing on the other side of the table , meaning I think he very much wants to see a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran . </s>
I will just suggest why in three different contexts , why the Iranians , particularly the hard-liners in Tehran , would like to see a confrontation between the U.S. and Iran . The first context is the regional context . What was very interesting for me following the right-wing Iranian media was these comments which Secretary Rice made after the war in Lebanon in July . </s>
What she called it was “the birth pangs of a new Middle East.” </s>
When I was following the Iranian right-wing media , it was very interesting how much they agreed with Secretary Rice , they said indeed it is the birth pangs of a new Middle East . Indeed this is a proxy war between the U.S. and Iran for hegemony in the Middle East , for Arab and Muslim hearts and minds . </s>
In fact we’re very well- placed to fight this war , and what’s very disconcerting right now is that these same newspapers in Tehran which are very fascist when it comes to domestic politics , are Jeffersonian democrats when it comes to regional politics because they say , actually , democratic elections are very much in our interest . Hamas came to power in Palestine , Hezbollah came to power in Lebanon through democratic elections , the Muslim Brotherhood had a very strong showing in Egypt . Hardcore religious came to power in Iraq via democratic elections . So in fact , we are winning this war for Arab and Muslim hearts and minds , and given the U.S.’s low standing in the region , it looks like history is now on our side . Opinion polls which are conducted show that among the Arab street , the three most popular leaders are Hassan Nasrallah of Hezbollah , Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran , and Khaled Meshaal of Hamas . </s>
So right now Iran feels in a very good position , and I think that bombing the country they would feel even better-placed to fight this war for Arab and Muslim hearts and minds . We should take into account that if we bomb Iran , oil prices are likely going to go up to $ 150 a barrel . </s>
Currently the regime is making about $ 200 million a day on oil revenue , so we double that , they’re going to make $ 400 million a day on oil revenue . I would argue that that will put them in a far better position to support Hamas and Hezbollah financially than if we don’t bomb the country . I think that just , if we’re serious about fighting this war , which is becoming very much this self-fulfilling prophecy of the clash of civilizations , we’re going to have to figure out a way to resolve our differences in the Middle East without using bombs . </s>
The second point is from a non-proliferation perspective , from a nuclear perspective . What would happen if we actually bomb Iran to try to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon . Let’s play out the scenario , in fact I played out the scenario with a Navy captain . Say we bomb these sites . First of all we don’t know where many of them are , some of them are underground , some of them we don’t have intelligence on , so we can’t be sure that we bombed the right sites . </s>
Second of all some of them are near population centers , we would be killing Iranian civilians . Quite frankly , you know , if you talk to nuclear physicists they say , well , Iran actually has quite a bit of know-how right now . It’s like baking a cake . </s>
They have the ingredients , they have the recipe , and they have the cooks , they have the scientists . Unless you’re going to kill the scientists , you’re going to kill the cooks , I mean , it’s going to be very difficult to set back this program a long way . At most , in talking to nuclear physicists , it will take Iran two to three years to recalibrate . At that point , if we bomb them , international public opinion may well side with them , and the Iranians may say in fact we now are after a nuclear weapon because we now have been shown that we need it to protect our sovereignty . </s>
At that point , when you bomb these sites and you don’t know where Iran is recalibrating these facilities , maybe underground , if we really then want to avert the prospect we’ll have to send in group troops . At this point , with our troops spread thin in Iraq and Afghanistan , that doesn’t look like a welcome prospect . </s>
Now from the domestic perspective , this is the one that for me I feel most strongly about . When I first started this job , I didn’t get involved in this work because I was passionate about centrifuges and cascades and things like that , this is what George was saying— Two minutes— —but about the prospect of the future for the Iranian people . There’s this widespread notion that all Iranians are in favor of a nuclear program , which I would like to debunk . </s>
I think that , on one hand Iran is a nationalist country , and many people feel strongly that we’re a great nation , why this double standard . India and Pakistan can have this project , why can’t we . But at the same time this is a country that we forget experienced an eight-year war with Iraq . Not really one family was left unscathed by this war , there were half a million casualties . </s>
No one romanticizes the conflict or the prospect of further militarization . Quite frankly this is a very technical project , the idea of enriching uranium as opposed to importing enriched uranium from abroad , so the idea that your average Iranian in Shiraz or Tehran wakes up in the morning and says , you know , if only we could enrich uranium today our lives would be so much better half , has also been very much exaggerated . One minute— But I would argue that you present to the Iranian people two options . You present this publicly to the regime . </s>
A , pursue this nuclear program unequivocally , come what may , for the sanctions , isolation , potential militarization . Or B , you take certain nuclear compromises and you reenter the international community . You’re going to have the people put a lot of pressure on the regime to change their behavior , and so far this has not been a policy option which has been issued by the U.S . Thank you very much . Thank you . </s>
That’s Karim Sadjadpour , and now speaking against the motion , Bill Kristol . </s>
Thank you , Robert . Let me begin by thanking Bob Rosenkranz for bringing Intelligence Squared to New York and to the United States . I don’t know if Intelligence Squared has a slogan or motto in London , but over here you might want to think about , “Fair and balanced.” “We debate , you decide.” You might almost call this a no-spin zone here , you know . </s>
With Robert Siegel , it’s Bill O’Reilly… I shouldn’t have said that , this will ruin his career on NPR , and I’ll never be invited back to “All Things Considered.” I personally came in undecided , um , as many of you did , and even leaning slightly to the other side , but I’ve been convinced by Reuel and Patrick’s brilliant arguments . Bob said he wanted intellectually respectable positions on both sides , and I have a high opinion of George and Sanam and Karim . But I’ve got to say that , unfortunately , they’re intelligent people but the arguments , while respectable , are not convincing . I was put off by Karim’s false praise of me for a second , and I salute Sanam for her genuine concern obviously for the Iranian people who I think we all agree deserve a much better regime than they have , and I think we all agree , we haven’t talked about this , deserve much more aggressive efforts on the part of the United States and other democracies and Europe could do much more here , to help them liberate themselves from this regime . </s>
George is one of the more reasonable Democrats in Washington . </s>
I’ve known him for a while and he worked for Senator Biden and I know that to be a fact , but the tip-off for all of you was when he said that he didn’t believe we should kill ourselves . I thought that was the safe position . That was a courageous break from the mainstream of the Democratic Party… I want to pay tribute to George , I’m doing my best to ruin all these people’s careers— That’s the conservative position against euthanasia— I’m doing my best to ruin all of their careers . </s>
Look , we should not tolerate a nuclear Iran . Three quick reasons , and a couple of them have been touched on but maybe not developed . George says , and I think everyone probably agrees that we have to be tougher in our diplomacy , think more seriously about sanctions , and move perhaps outside the Security Council to get sanctions if we can , explore financial pressure to really squeeze Iran which I think the administration is beginning to do . </s>
Secretary of the Treasury Paulsen is working pretty seriously on this , and that would be done I think outside the Security Council through a sort of coalition of the willing on the Finance Ministry side . This is all good . None of this will work unless it’s backed up by the threat of force . Diplomacy will only work if there is a real threat of force , not just saying options are on the table , but a sense that we really won’t tolerate the outcome if Iran does not yield , if the moderates to the degree there are some in the Iranian regime , aren’t empowered by the pressure we’re putting on to prevent the headlong rush to nuclear weapons , and manage to change course domestically . </s>
Diplomacy can’t work without the threat of force , therefore , it would really be disastrous to diplomacy to say , we must tolerate a nuclear Iran . So whatever people might think one would have to do , and sometimes one has to do things in the real world seven or 10 years from now or three years from now I suppose , we should not say we should tolerate a nuclear Iran and therefore you should all vote “No , ” just to help diplomacy along . </s>
But I’m serious about that , and I’m serious that I believe shouldn’t at the end of—I will satisfy Karim and say that I would bomb Iran in a pinch . But it is important to not even signal weakness . </s>
The only reason the Europeans got serious in 2003 is that we went into Iraq , that we hadn’t yet encountered the difficulties we’ve encountered in the subsequent three years , and Iranians were worried and the Europeans were worried that Bush really would use force . </s>
That’s what made the Europeans much tougher than it looked as if they would have been prior to 2003 . So for diplomacy to work , you need the credible threat of force , you therefore could not say that we would tolerate , or certainly not that we must tolerate a nuclear Iran . So for diplomacy to work you need the threat of force . The credible , real threat of force . </s>
Real plans , real attempt to lay the groundwork for it if it comes to that . </s>
Secondly , deterrence . That is the ultimate argument obviously on the other side , we can deter Iran , we deterred the Soviet Union , we deterred China . Pakistan and India have nuclear weapons and so far at least haven’t used them . </s>
That depends on the nature of the regime . Is this the Brezhnev regime , so to speak ? Conservative , cautious old men , as George said ? </s>
Or is this a much more radical regime , or at least a regime with radical elements in it , and do we have confidence that the radical elements won’t prevail internally ? I don’t think so . This is a rising , confident , ambitious , aggressive regime , that thinks it’s carrying forth a historic mission , sort of a jihadist mission on behalf of Islam in general , particularly Shia Islam but perfectly willing to work with Sunni jihadists and also to compete with Sunni jihadists in radicalism which is itself very dangerous and of course that’s the story in some respects of the last 25 years in the Middle East , with the Wahabes and the Iranians competing to radicalize Islam and unfortunately , succeeding . Letting Iran progress towards nuclear weapons just increases the strength of all the worst radicalizing forces , the jihadist forces , within Islam . It would be disastrous in my opinion not just for Iran to get nuclear weapons . </s>
It’s disastrous for them to succeed in progressing towards nuclear weapons over the next two , four , six , eight years . Every month that we huff and puff and the Europeans huff and puff and we put off another Security Council resolution and they progress and Ahmadinejad comes here and is treated well by the Council of Foreign Relations and— Two minutes . —and pays no price for anything he says or anything he does , every month and every year that that happens , the worst forces in the Middle East are strengthened , every government that’s teetering and isn’t sure which side to join basically , our side , the moderate side or the radical side , decides they have to cut a deal with the radical side . </s>
Individuals decide that looks like the way of the future , this is the classic , dangerous scenario . One hopes that the more moderate people , the more moderate forces in the Iranian regime , are going to prevail , and the only way to help them to prevail , is not to reward Ahmadinejad . That is what we are now doing by holding open the possibility that we would tolerate a nuclear Iran . It’s not just that it would be terrible if they got nuclear weapons . There , I think incidentally , it’s not just tolerating a nuclear Iran , it’s tolerating a nuclear Egypt and a nuclear Saudi Arabia , and then a whole bunch of nuclear countries which itself creates a very dangerous world . </s>
It is also the process of getting towards a nuclear Iran , is itself extremely dangerous— One minute . I don’t like to use models from the ‘30s or the analogy of the ‘30s or Hitler but in this respect it is like the ‘30s . </s>
Hitler’s success at each stage strengthened him internally , he didn’t start out in firm control of the regime of which he was chancellor . There were others who thought he was reckless . Every time he did something reckless and got away with it , it discredited his internal credits , it empowered fascists elsewhere in Europe and other regimes began moving in that direction . </s>
The democracies became demoralized , we ended up fighting a war against a much more powerful fascist alliance-axis than would have been the case if we had acted much earlier . We face that prospect unfortunately if we let a jihadist radical regime successfully pursue nuclear weapons in the Middle East today . Thank you , William Kristol . I’m now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate vote . Before the debate , you may recall you were asked whether you were for or against the motion or whether you don’t know . </s>
Here’s the pre-debate tally , for which we will not need the U.S. Supreme Court to sort out the answer . 58 votes for the motion , that we must tolerate a nuclear Iran , 103 votes against the motion , and 58 don’t knows . So that was the vote before the debate . We’re now ready for the question-and- answer portion of the program . If you would like to put a question to our panelists please raise your hand . </s>
Someone on either one of the aisles will find you with a microphone . I’ll call on you . As you’re asking the question , please stand up . If you’re a member of the working press and asking a question , please identify yourself . Otherwise it’s your call , and I’m going to begin in the front row , with this young lady . </s>
WOMAN Hi . I’m not sure how much of it is a question , but I think it is . I’m on the “for” side , but I have to say the most compelling argument on the “con” is , not the prospect of Iran having a nuclear weapon but the prospect of Venezuela , Egypt . </s>
So I feel strongly that yes , we must set a precedent , so that we don’t have 20 , 30 nations with nuclear weapons . But then I wonder , how realistic is that ? </s>
You look at the nations that are pursuing nuclear weapons , and these are nations that feel marginalized and threatened . </s>
It’s definitely I think a pursuit , both for protection and also for machismo or for popularity in their home . So is it really realistic to think that we are going to now have 10 more nations with nuclear weapons in the 10 , 20 years ? The kind of comment along with that too is there’s an interesting vicious cycle that’s set in place when , by starting another war you are creating this vicious cycle of other regimes feeling threatened , and then spurring them on to produce nuclear weapons . Will we be giving Chavez more of an impetus to get into the nuclear weapon battle ? Well , since the argument of the one-too-many nuclear Irans was made by the opponents , may I ask the supporters of the motion , George Perkovich , to answer it . </s>
Does tolerating a nuclear Iran imply tolerating many other new nuclear powers ? Well , I think we’ll come to this later . We’re now confused about what it means to tolerate or not to tolerate , because I happen to agree with everything Patrick said because he didn’t talk about going to war . </s>
I agree with Reuel and Bill , we should do everything we can to try to prevent it . </s>
So if what we mean by “tolerating” is that we really , really don’t like it , we’re going to do everything we can to stop it , but we would accept living with it if that was the alternative other than war , then I think we agree . </s>
If the alternative really is what Bill said , but not what Patrick said , that not tolerating it means that you are willing to go to war over it , then I would say to your question , there’s only been one case in history where there was a military effort to stop a country from trying to get nuclear weapons . That was the Israeli bombing of Iraq in 1981 . </s>
You can argue what the effects of that were in various ways . </s>
Iraq went to war or was at war with Iran , and then , we had another war with them in ’91 and then we had another war with them in 2003 , and their nuclear program continued when we didn’t think it was from ’81 to ’91 , but when we thought it was or some people thought it was , it turned out it wasn’t . We’re there now . </s>
Every other case of getting a country to stop involved politics , negotiations , giving them benefits , security guarantees , trade-offs , and deals . So we should be concerned about if Iran succeeds , what happens . But the way the rest of the world’s going to respond to this is going to be if you marshal diplomatic pressure , economic sanctions , plus rewards . </s>
That’s the way to do it . Reuel Marc Gerecht , why don’t you reply to what George Perkovich is saying . I would just like to say that I’m very uncomfortable being in the majority if that poll is correct . </s>
I think the other side should demand a recount . But I mean , just a quick comment on that . I don’t think it’s any coincidence that Gamal Mubarak announced that Egypt is going to have a civilian nuclear program . </s>
I think the timing of that , because of the Iranian nuclear program , was intentional . I would add that there’s a great deal of suspicion that the Saudis were in part financial backers of the Pakistani nuclear program . </s>
It is impossible I think to overestimate the fierce hatred and competition that exists and has existed between Saudi Arabia and the Islamic republic from 1979 , Bill alluded to it . </s>
Much of the Islamic militancy that we see today , the fuel behind bin Ladinism , actually grew out of that competition in the 1980s . It would be surprising not to see the Saudis make some play for a nuke . I would also add , I wouldn’t at all be surprised to see Turkey go in a nuclear direction . </s>
I think the Iraq war certainly showed to the Turks they can not rely upon NATO as an institution of their defense , and I think the animosity that does exist in Turkey , even if it goes in a more Islamic direction which I think it will , will not diminish its profound suspicions of the Islamic republic . I think it would be a good guess that the Turks too would start working on a nuclear program . Next question , do we have someone on that side ? </s>
Won’t you hand the microphone…and then we’ll come over to the other side of the room next . Could you stand up , please . </s>
Eugene Linden’s my name . </s>
Given the present situation in Iraq and Afghanistan , and the possibility of $ 150-a-barrel oil , do we really have a credible military threat ? </s>
You mean does , is the threat from the United States credible ? Patrick Clawson . In a word , yes . First off , if the United States military were to take action Iran’s nuclear sites , this would be the Navy and the Air Force , which are not overly committed in Afghanistan and Iraq . It would be quite a doable thing to destroy the key nodes in Iran’s nuclear program . </s>
We don’t have to flatten the whole thing , don’t have to go in and Dresden and knock it all down . We just have to knock out the key nodes , and there are some key nodes without which that program can not function , and it would take a number of years to rebuild . The question arises as to what Iran’s response would be if we did this . Well , we don’t know , it would depend upon the circumstances . But I would suggest that there was a time when in fact as far as the Iranians are concerned , we did bomb them , and we did take military action against them . </s>
That’s the end of the Iran-Iraq war , when we after all , in what we see as a tragic accident , shot down an Iranian airbus and killed 200-plus Iranian civilians . But they saw that very bluntly as the United States entering the war . Indeed , this being holy defense week , and the Iranian newspapers have been full of interviews with people about the war and how it happened , and Rafsanjani has asked , well why did you end the war ? Because America ended the war against us . So the fact is that the last time we bombed Iran the result was within a week , that the Iranians accepted a cease-fire , it stopped a war which had killed 700,000 people . </s>
We paid no price in our relationships with the Iranians . That’s because the Iranian people were sick and tired of that war . </s>
So the task is up to us to paint this nuclear weapon as the device which the mullahs are using to consolidate their power and their control and to keep their grip on the country . Because if Iranians perceive that what we are doing is getting rid of the tool by which the mullahs are going to consolidate their control , that’s a very different situation than if Iranians think that this is a national bomb needed for national defense . I wanted to see if the other side agrees that there is a credible military threat , no ground troops , simply air strikes . Karim . </s>
Obviously the United States is powerful enough to bomb Iran , that’s not the question . The question is the day after we bomb Iran , just like the question in Iraq should have been the day after we bomb Iraq . Obviously the United States could change probably every regime in the world apart from a few , China , Russia , India . </s>
But what are the repercussions for the day after ? </s>
I would argue that at the moment even the Iranians believe that Iranian soft power is dominating U.S. hard power in Iraq . I would just put on the table that it’s fundamentally incompatible to think we’re going to stabilize Iraq , while simultaneously dropping bombs on Iran , not to mention other countries in the region . </s>
If we really want to try to tranquilize Lebanon , we will see a resurgent Hezbollah if we drop bombs on Iran . We want to tranquilize Palestine and strengthen the moderate Palestinians we’re going to strengthen Hamas , if we do that . </s>
I just want to make a further point that , Bill and Reuel have written that it’s unclear what would happen domestically within Iran if we dropped bombs . Maybe actually , we could over time strengthen the Iranian moderates . This always reminds me of a quote from John Limber , the great U.S. diplomat who was actually taken hostage in Iran for 444 days during the 1979 revolution . </s>
He was someone like many Iranians , my father included , who believed that when the Shah was deposed , the Shah’s government would be replaced by a secular democracy , and what we saw of course was that Khomeini came to , to power . He later wrote in his memoirs that , that what he learned was that when sudden upheavals happen , revolutions are not won by those who can write incisive op-ed pieces . I think likewise in Iran we should have no illusions that if we bomb the country it’s going to be moderates who come to the helm either within Iran or within the region . Sanam Vakil ? </s>
Could I just add one more thing . If we also think about bombing Iran , we also have to think about not just nuclear nationalism that persists within the country , but just inherent nationalism , the patriotism of Iranians that they feel for their country , Iranians who don’t even love the regime but love Iran . The same way that you might love the United States of America or wherever you’re from . These are the Iranians that will come out in defense of their country . </s>
There are many Iranians I spoke with this summer , that said in the event of a military strike , they would come out in defense of their country and that’s something that we should consider . </s>
These are the people that fought an Iran-Iraq war , not for two years , not for four years , for eight long years . And that same way that you , your sons and your children would come out and defend the United States in the event of a military strike . Reuel Gerecht ? </s>
Yes , I don’t think anyone on this side of the table believes that bombing Iran will produce a moderate revolution inside the country , and in fact I think we’d say that’s really not the issue at all . The issue is do you believe that an Islamic republic armed with nuclear weapons is going to help the United States stabilize Iraq . </s>
I think that is not at all true , just the opposite . As long as the radical forces inside of Iran gain power and gain will , I think it is impossible to imagine a situation inside of Iraq that is going to be stable and in any way pro-American . I think you will see the forces of radicalism inside the Iraqi Shia community , continue to gain ground , they’re becoming a dominant force in that society , and Iran has no intention of deterring them . Certainly an Iran armed with nuclear weaponry , I don’t think would be a force of moderation inside Iraqi politics . </s>
Our next questioner ? Sir . MAN I’m very sympathetic obviously to the “con” side . But I think one question has to be answered , which is : at this present time , what are you going to do about Western Europe . </s>
What are you going to do about the Europeans in terms of their support or non-support for this kind of event , and the reality that in another two years we’re going to have another election . Blair is on his way out , clearly the sense or spirit of accommodation is reflected I think in both the Labour Party and in the Conservative Party . So rather than just thinking in terms of next month , what is one’s answer to the question , how can we really threaten this unilaterally if we can not bring any of the major powers in Europe along with us . Bill Kristol , what’s the answer to that question . </s>
The only reason the major powers in Europe are as engaged as they are diplomatically and at least talking , some of them , sometimes , about sanctions , on Iran is that in fact they were worried in 2003 that we might use force . As the threat of force has receded , as we’ve been so reassuring in the last year and embraced diplomacy and made clear to the Europeans that we put getting along with Europeans I think unfortunately perhaps at a higher level of priority than actually dealing with the Iranian nuclear program , they of course have cheerfully backed off . </s>
They’re not going to be ultimately extremely helpful in this . They will not privately shed any tears for the Iranian nuclear program and I don’t think we’ll have any great rupture in NATO , we’ll still have peacekeeping forces in Afghanistan . But no , they will probably not be part of the mission , and they will in some ritualistic way , probably denounce it . But if a nuclear Iran is really dangerous and I think it is , we can’t be stopped by the lowest common denominators of our allies . </s>
The unfortunate truth , I wish Western Europe were different , I wish all of Europe were somewhat different , I wish they spent more on the military , I wish they were more serious about dealing with coming threats from outside their region . They’re not , and we have to take the lead . Our next question , from the gentleman in the center . Van Greenfield . I voted against to start , I’m still there now . </s>
I think that when we recount again , if Karim and Sanam actually listen to their own words , then the people against will pick up two votes . </s>
I’m very serious about that . I think that Sanam said that Ahmadinejad dreams of becoming a war president . </s>
I fully agree with that , completely support that , I think that he believes it with his heart and soul . If he does feel that way , and has a nuclear weapon , we’re much worse off . </s>
Karim’s comment was that Iran getting a nuclear weapon would be disastrous . If it’s disastrous if they get it , and if he dreams of becoming a war president , I don’t see how you don’t vote that way . The question I’d like to ask is , as I sit here I was kind of astounded that we heard about virtually every country on the globe here , but the one country that we didn’t hear anything about , or any effect about , the country in a way most affected by the words that have been spoken , is Israel . Robert , you can choose who would answer it , but where do Israel and our obligation to Israel factor into this ? I mean , they have to believe the words— </s>
—in the presentations , but first I should say that Sanam and Karim , you’ve been called upon to debate your own remarks . </s>
If there’s something you’d like to say first , feel free to . I stand by the statement that it would be a disaster if Iran were acquire a nuclear weapon , but I would just say it would be far more disastrous to bomb them to try to prevent them from acquiring a nuclear weapon . These are the scales we’re forced to measure right now . I think Bill and Reuel and Patrick would agree that as long as this government is in power in Tehran , they will never feel comfortable that it’s somehow lost its nuclear ambitions . </s>
As long as this government is in power I think they’ll always feel that will happen . My point is that if we bomb Iran , we’re going to prolong the life of this regime I would argue two , three , maybe four decades . That what’s going to happen is that these radicals are going to come to the helm , they’re going to clamp down on any type of moderates , and they’re going to have the pretext to do so . </s>
So if you want to preserve the shelf life of this regime then we bomb it , that’s my argument . </s>
Sanam , does President Ahmadinejad need U.S. provocation to become a war president or war leader , or will he become one on his own ? </s>
Oh , no , he’s begging the U.S. to do it . He’s not there just yet . I think you misinterpreted . He’s looking for the U.S. to bomb Iran so he can avoid the economic mandate , his populistic mandate of why he was elected . He is not going to be able to fill the plates of 74 million Iranians . </s>
And so foreign policy issues are a nice method of deflection for this president . Bombing Iran would propel this radical president to a higher post . The presidency of Iran is never , historically and constitutionally , a strong position , and we’re making him stronger every day by paying attention to him . </s>
If we bomb the country , he will be propelled even more . We will be radicalizing the country in his favor even more , and he will be neglecting his economic mandate , and the fastest way to get him out of power will be to force him to focus on the economic issues that he was elected into office on . Patrick Clawson , to what degree is this about the threat perceived by Israel from Iran . Well , first you’ll notice that the other side continually does not debate the proposition . </s>
They debate a very different proposition . The proposition they debate is we should not bomb Iran . Now if that were the question we were debating , it would be an interesting debate . But it’s not what we’re here to do tonight . </s>
The question is , do we tolerate Iran’s nuclear program . </s>
That’s like saying , are we going to have the attitude towards an Iranian nuke that we have towards an Indian and a Pakistani nuke . We tolerate that . We say , naughty-naughty , you shouldn’t have done that , but we tolerate it . </s>
The question is , are we going to have that kind of an attitude , or are we , as Bill said , going to use instead the threat of force in order to back up diplomacy . Bill didn’t call for bombs away , neither did I , and neither did Reuel . What we called for is to have— I wouldn’t—let’s not go too far here . We have a diversity of views on this side too , you know . </s>
Some of your teammates are on the record on this— There was a wonderful Commentary article by Ed Lutfoch in which he said it’s not time to bomb Iran , yet . </s>
It may come to be the time . But it’s not yet the time . Because what we’re talking about is how we can use force in order to—the threat of force in order to back up that diplomacy . But George Perkovich , you’re the pessimist about the diplomacy . You’re the one who’s saying it’s going to end up as an attack or not an attack . </s>
That’s in part because of the Israel question . The answer is because Israel evaluates the threat to it as much worse than the threat to us . Then it’s quite possible that Israel will decide that it’s got to attack Iran well before we decide to attack Iran . In fact I would say that that’s likely that Israel will decide that it has to attack Iran , long before we think we have to attack Iran . That’s going to force the issue about what to do about this . </s>
Well , it’s precisely because we don’t want to be in that situation that we have got to accelerate our efforts on the diplomacy , and we can use Israel as that mad dog the threat of which we wave in front of the Europeans in order to get them to be more serious about this matter . George Perkovich . We don’t disagree with that , that we have to accelerate and toughen diplomacy , that we don’t want Iran to have nukes , all of that we agree with . </s>
But what does it mean to not tolerate something ? Step up all those efforts . I agree , and then if those don’t fail , what does it mean not to talk . Bill says it means go to war . </s>
Reuel has said it means go to war . Patrick hasn’t quite said that , so I’m not clear what the resolution is . We have a healthy diversity of views on our side , we don’t insist on orthodoxy unlike some people , you know . George , you’re saying , don’t tolerate it . </s>
You’re saying take action against it . </s>
Well , this proposition is not , go to war with Iran . </s>
That’s not the proposition we’re debating . May I make a point , a substantive point— But what you’re saying is pretend not to tolerate it . No , no , no , no . We shouldn’t tolerate it— </s>
And then maybe at some point you tolerate it , and Bill says— No , no , we shouldn’t— This is a semantic debate— </s>
To clarify , Patrick Clawson , you’re saying , worst case , if all the diplomatic measures you’re talking about don’t succeed , then you’ll tolerate it . </s>
No . Worst case , if the only way we can make the diplomatic measures succeed , as Bill has said , is if we say at the end of the day if they don’t we’ll use force . </s>
Because the only way we can make diplomacy work is if we say at the end of the day , we are prepared to use force . That is what we should be doing . But the other side has not said about—George says , we should press them , press them . </s>
How the heck are you going to press them , if you say at the end of the day that what we’re prepared to do , is tolerate it . </s>
They’re not going to be interested in being friends . Can I say a word on this , this is just semantics . </s>
Look , the serious argument and most respectable argument I would say on the other side is Karim’s , that bombing would prolong the regime , would strengthen the regime . I take that argument very seriously . Ahmadinejad successfully pursuing and acquiring nuclear weapons in my view would strengthen the regime and strengthen the radical elements in the regime , much more surely than bombing would . Bombing is of course , you don’t know what effects . </s>
There’s empirical , historical evidence of the use of force destabilizing and discrediting a radical and aggressive regime , and there are historical examples of nationalist tempers flaring at least for a while , and the radicals being strengthened . I wouldn’t want to stipulate one or the other , but the one thing I think we can stipulate is that letting the most radical elements pursue nuclear weapons successfully would in fact strengthen the regime . So I think if you care about ending the regime which is what one has to care about , one has to be serious about saying we don’t tolerate this regime , this Iranian regime acquiring nuclear weapons , and then acting if necessary to prevent it . </s>
Karim Sadjadpour . I’d argue that at the end of the day what’s going to change this regime is economic malaise . </s>
It’s not going to be bombing it , it’s not going to be a nuclear issue , but similar to the Soviet Union , at the end of the day you can’t eat a nuclear weapon . That’s what’s going to change this government , but again I think that if we do give it a pretext to clamp down on its domestic population it will very much take it , and we could see the prospect of change moved back many years . I would just argue as well that if we somehow were able to manage a nuclear-armed Soviet Union and a nuclear-armed China , which had far greater appetite than Iran did , it seems to me preposterous that we can’t tolerate a nuclear- armed Iran in this context , in the context of deterrence . Well , thank you both , thank you all very much for commenting on our audience’s questions , and for clarifying the semantics of the motion , or muddying the semantics of the motion , I’m not sure which . I’m intrigued by the idea that Bill Kristol came here undecided , and is newly won over to the “con” position . </s>
Which would make him a neocon , finally . </s>
It’s now time to vote . You may think you’ve voted before but you’re going to vote again . This is the ticket you were given on the way in , and all of you should have one . </s>
If you don’t , don’t worry , an usher will provide you with one now . There are three possible votes you may cast with this . </s>
Someone’s going to come by with a ballot box . If you’re for the resolution , take off the green “for , ” it’s perforated , and drop that in the box . </s>
If you’re against , the red . If you’re still undecided , or if you are now undecided , drop the entire untorn ballot into the ballot box . As you do that , let’s make sure that the ballot boxes are making their way around the auditorium . In a moment , we shall hear brief concluding statements from our six panelists . </s>
What sort of progress are the ballot boxes making . Good . Good . </s>
We heard earlier from each of our panelists with an opening statement that began with those supporting the motion . We’re now going to hear brief concluding statements , of no more than two minutes each , beginning with those who are against . </s>
We start with Patrick Clawson . </s>
Patrick ? According to the New York Times when Kofi Annan was in Iran at the beginning of the month , he was quite astonished in his meeting with President Ahmadinejad when President Ahmadinejad explained that while Britain and the United States won the last world war , Iran was going to win the next one . Now , Kofi Annan didn’t even realize there was going to be a next world war . </s>
Much less , than Iran intended to emerge victorious from it . Do not underestimate the ambitions of a group which feels that they represent a quarter of the world , namely the world’s Muslims . They feel , that they’ve brought down one superpower , the Soviet Union , thanks to the , the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan , and that indeed , they can bring down another . They have very extensive ambitions . So this issue of whether to allow them to have nuclear weapons , is of extraordinary import to us . </s>
That is why we should be prepared to make credible threats of the use of force . Only through making credible threats of the use of force , is the kind of diplomacy that I described is going to be successful . </s>
If we begin that diplomatic process by saying at the end of the day , we are prepared to live with you , to tolerate this nuclear Iran , we will get nowhere with that diplomacy . We will get nowhere with forging an international consensus for strong actions of the kind that we have been able to use successfully to slow down Iran 's program for the last 18 years . Paradoxically only the credible threat of force is likely to prevent us from facing the danger of force . We have talked a lot about whether or not the United States will bomb Iran . </s>
Let us recognize , if Iran gets the bomb , it may bomb us . </s>
Thank you Patrick Clawson . </s>
George Perkovich . </s>
Again I 'm confused by the terms . </s>
Because we agree with almost everything especially that Patrick said . And with much that Reuel and Bill said about its , the nature of the Iranian government . What we want for the people of Iran . </s>
How bad it would be if Iran got nuclear weapons . And I do n't understand what it means not to tolerate . </s>
Because Patrick has used the verb say . </s>
We should say we wo n't tolerate . He said we should have credible threat by using force but avoids the issue of would it be our policy actually go to war . Which to me means not tolerate . </s>
Bill 's clear at least , he 's saying yeah you know yeah we 'll go to war . Um that 's what the resolution means on their side . </s>
Not tolerate means physically stop . Physically try to act against . And then the question is does that guarantee success ? </s>
There is no guarantee of success . We found the trouble in Iraq that was totally unanticipated . Reasonable people would expect things to go badly in Iran . So you ca n't guarantee – One minute . </s>
Success . We have an experience with China . When China was getting nuclear weapons in 1964 , the US Government was prepared to launch nuclear war against it , to destroy China , to keep it from getting nuclear weapons . Then we thought no , instead of that we 'll give nuclear weapons to India in 1963 . </s>
To balance China . We were afraid that Mao was such a revolutionary . </s>
He had killed more than twenty million of his own people . Something the Iranian regime has n't dreamed of . We thought it would be the end of civilization , that revolution would happen everywhere under this nuclear umbrella . </s>
Well in fact we decided that we couldn’t stop China . China got nuclear weapons . Here we are today . </s>
China is a huge economic threat to us today but it is n't like you 're gon na go home tonight worrying that China 's gon na wake up and nuke the United States . </s>
Which it does have the capability to do . And which Iran for the foreseeable future would have no capability to do . Do I think we should publicly say we 'll tolerate it and welcome it ? Absolutely not . </s>
But the exercise here is to try and clarify in your own mind , in your own plan - On that note George we will remain just that clarified and no more . </s>
Next concluding statement from Reuel Marc Gerecht . Well I remember having a conversation with a good friend of mine , Jeffrey Goldberg who now writes for the New Yorker and used to write for the New York Times Magazine and Jeffrey had just gone over to madrassas in Pakistan and he was interviewing young students . And he kept asking them what do you believe in ? And they kept saying to him , I believe in jihad , I believe in killing Americans . And he 'd go to the next one – I believe in jihad , I believe in killing Americans . </s>
And he kept doing that you know day after day . And so he got some idea what they believed in . Now the Iranians do n't ask that way all right . </s>
They 're vastly more refined . That 's what makes them in many ways the most , and also contradictory , that 's what makes them I would argue the most interesting people in the Middle East . But do not make a mistake , this question , this debate is about what is at the center of their spirit . </s>
And they are dedicated , they are dedicated to the jihad against the United States . They are the mothership of much of the Islamic radicalism that we have seen and what is striking about the regime in Tehran is that it has n't become more moderate . It has n't in fact gone into a period of thermidor . One minute . That the moderates that everybody has hope in and I have hope in them too , have been stuffed . </s>
And that you do not see them coming forward . You do not see them gaining power where it matters . </s>
It is great and wonderful that the average Iranian on the street is in fact becoming much , much more moderate . It does n't matter . What matters is the people at the top and they have not and I sincerely suggest that you do not want people like that who believe they represent God on earth and that they represent the vanguard for all Muslims to have nuclear weapons . Thank you Reuel Marc Gerecht . Now to one of the most interesting people in the Middle East , now to Sanam Vakil . </s>
I appreciate Reuel 's comments that the government of Iran is the vanguard of leading this one fourth of , and Patrick 's , one fourth of the world into jihad . But that 's not the government that I 'm aware of and that I have been studying . </s>
Perhaps two different countries that we 've been working on . And my interviews that I recently conducted in Tehran , many people in the variety of camps of the regime , Ahmadinejad 's ministry as well , told me repeatedly that it 's the constant threat from abroad , regime change threats from the US administration that have been coming from the past four years . </s>
Threats of sanctions , containment , isolation of this regime that are perpetuating these fears within the Iranian regime . So consider that when thinking the Iranian mentality . There are two ways of going forward . We have the military option . </s>
But we have an option that has never been actually pursued . </s>
Twenty seven years of isolation , there 's a wide gulf . Why not actually try direct engagement with these crazy folks ? And let 's see actually what they might do . </s>
If we 're actually dealing with them one on one bring them close . </s>
Make your enemies our friends . We can monitor their nuclear program and often times there 's a lot of talk on the Iranian street that the hope of having America back in Iran will actually stimulate the Iranian people and recharge them and that might be the way to perhaps lead to a prosperous and maybe even hopeful Iran in the future . Thank you Sanam Vakil . And now I will hear from Bill Kristol . Really just three points . </s>
Proliferation , terror and jihad . The proliferation threat is unlike that of when the Soviet Union or China acquired nuclear weapons . </s>
It 's not just a generic Venezuela , Brazil , South Africa , etc threat . Nigeria – that is a real issue too . But it is an absolute I mean it is very likely that Turkey , Egypt , Saudi Arabia , Algeria would decide they would want nuclear weapons if Iran had them . I do n't know if we could stop them , we could offer them security guarantees , if people feel comfortable living in a world where we 're providing security guarantees against a nuclear Iran for a Wahabi Saudi Arabia . I suppose we can try to manage that world . </s>
It would be safer I think to prevent Iran from becoming nuclear in the first place . We are talking about an extremely dangerous arms race in the most volatile region in the world . </s>
That was not the case when previous nations went nuclear . India , Pakistan a little bit more like that . And Pakistan was the worst one to have allowed to have gone nuclear but now this is Pakistan squared . </s>
So to speak . Cubed or something . </s>
Second , terror , providing a nuclear umbrella for terror is not something that 's been done . The Soviet Union played with terror and did some pretty bad , funded some pretty bad things but nothing like the intimate relation to terror that the Islamic Republic of Iran has had . And people need to think seriously about what a nuclear umbrella over terror acts with the possibility of giving nuclear weapons to terror groups but also protecting terror groups by a threat of nuclear retaliation . What that does in the Middle East , here Israel I think becomes a central question and how does that , how does Israel then react to terror groups , protected so to say by Iranian nuclear threat of retaliation . </s>
Finally , jihad , Patrick and Reuel have made this point right . This regime , getting nuclear weapons would be the biggest booster shot for jihad and I think both on the Shia and Sunni side is possible . That is the threat . </s>
The jihadists need to , those on the wavering need to be convinced that jihadists are losing – letting this regime get nuclear weapons would convince too many people unfortunately that they 're winning . Thank you Bill Kristol . And lastly Karim Sadjadpour . </s>
I think one thing that 's been missing tonight is Iran 's ambitions . Iran 's impetus . We talked a lot about what the US is thinking , what Israel is thinking but we ca n't look at Iran 's ambitions in a vacuum . And if I would make the argument that as a – it 's not that they want to pursue nuclear weapons to wipe Israel off the map . We tried to get inside the head of Iranian leaders they say well this revolution of ours happened twenty seven years ago and to this day the US has never recognized us . </s>
And look historically at countries that have pursued nuclear weapons . Not been for offensive purposes . </s>
Has been very much driven by senses of insecurity and defensive purposes . I would just invoke the paradigm which many in the right in the US have invoked when it comes to Iran . And that is one of two ticking clocks . </s>
So there 's the regime change clock and there 's the nuclear clock . </s>
And the idea is that you have to make the regime change clock in Tehran expire faster than the nuclear talk so when the day comes when Iran actually weaponizes , it will be under more friendly , democratic Iranian regime . </s>
Now the fundamental contradiction of this policy is that when you try to expedite the regime change clock in Tehran you send the message to Iranian leaders that in fact the United States is after nuclear , is after regime change approach . And therefore you need to pursue a nuclear deterrent . So we have to get these clocks worked up . Is the option , is the goal to prevent Iran from going nuclear or is it to change the regime ? </s>
If we continue to try to do both , that 's going to be Iran 's greatest impetus for pursuing a nuclear weapon . </s>
Thank you Karim Sadjadpour . And thank you to all six panelists for your very ardent contributions . </s>
It 's now time to announce the results of the audience voting and after our debaters did their best to sway you , you voted eighty two for the motion that we must tolerate a nuclear Iran . One hundred sixteen against . </s>
And twenty one remain undecided or do n't know how they would answer that . </s>
So congratulations to the opponents of the motion for their winning the debate here this evening . And to the proposer , and to the proposer and his team for increasing his tally so much after the debate . I 'd just like to invite all of you to return in three weeks for the next Intelligence Squared US debate . Wednesday , October 18th , it 's here at Asia Society and Museum and the motion to be debated on that day is freedom of expression must include the license to offend . And the panelists will include such folks as Philip Gourevitch and Christopher Hitchens . </s>
I 'll let you try to figure out which side of the offending question Hitchens is going to be on . An edited version of tonight 's Intelligence Squared US debate can be heard locally on WNYC AM 820 on Friday , October 6th at 2 PM . Outside of New York City you 'll have to check your local NPR member station listings for the date and time of broadcast there . Please be sure to pick up a copy of our media sponsor 's Thursday edition of the Times of London . </s>
And also a copy of the Times Literary Supplement on your way out and thanks to all of you for your support of Intelligence Squared US . I’d like to introduce Robert Rosenkranz , who is Chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation which is the sponsor of Intelligence Squared and he will frame tonight’s debate . Bob . Thank you , Robert . </s>
Thank you very much , and welcome . Well , my task this evening is to frame tonight’s debate , and I frankly find it a bit challenging . Unlike most of our debates , which speak to policy , this one is about facts . Islam has some one and a half billion adherents . </s>
Muslims in America seem quite well integrated into our society . Arabs account for only twenty-five percent of all Muslims . </s>
The majority are found throughout Asia . But the radical Islamic movement in the Arab world , their doctrines of jihad , holy war , their tactics of terror – that’s what sort of shapes our view . </s>
Well , is this view distorted ? The polling data is not reassuring . Consider the following examples . </s>
In Pakistan , Indonesia , Morocco and Egypt between seventy-three percent and ninety-two percentbelieve that the U.S. goal is definitely or probably to weaken and divide Islam . In the same countries , only nine to twenty-three percent believe that the goal of the U.S. war on terror is to protect itself from terror attacks . In those countries , around twenty percent of those surveyed supported Al Qaeda’s attacks on Americans and more than seventy percent agreed with such Al Qaeda goals as deterring U.S. support for Israel pushing Western values and Western militaries out of Islamic countries and affirming Muslim dignity by standing up to America . And it’s astonishing to note that only between two and thirty-five percent of those polled identified Al Qaeda as behind the 9/11 attacks . </s>
In contrast , twenty to thirty-eight percent identified the U.S. or Israel as the perpetrators of 9/11 . And to end on a deeply confusing note , in Egypt eighty-eight percent agree that groups like Al Qaeda that use violence against civilians are violating the principles of Islam , yet sixty percent believe that suicide bombers are often or sometimes justified . Well , what are we to make of all of this ? From a geopolitical standpoint , are the radicals the only ones who matter ? Does their organization , intensity and violence effectively intimidate more moderate voices ? </s>
Are we engaged , in Samuel Huntington’s formulation , in a clash of civilizations ? Or is that precisely the characterization that the radicals hope to provoke ? I’m confident that tonight’s panel can shed some light and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over to our long-time radio host , and the host of NPR’s All Things Considered – Robert Siegel . Thank you , Bob . Thank you . </s>
And I’d like to welcome you to this , the ninth debate of the second Intelligence Squared U.S. series . The resolution that’s being debated tonight is : Islam is dominated by radicals . </s>
And I’m going to give you a brief rundown of the evening . Members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument . Presentations are limited , strictly limited , to seven minutes each . When opening arguments are complete , I’ll open up the floor to brief questions from the audience , and after the Q & A session , each debater will make a final two minute summation . </s>
And finally , you will vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad that’s attached to the armrest of your seat and I’ll announce your decision on which side carried the day . Let’s begin , though , with a pre-debate vote . I’d like you to pick up the keypad that’s attached to the armrest on your left . And , for audience members sitting along the aisle to my right , your keypad is attached to the armrest on your right side , next to your neighbor’s . Has everybody found their keypad ? </s>
Shall we take a vote on whether you’ve found your keypad ? Good . Now , tonight’s resolution is : Islam is dominated by radicals . </s>
After my prompt , press one to vote for the motion , two to vote against the motion and three if you are undecided . You may begin voting now . And I will be informed of and reveal the results of your vote later in the evening . </s>
I’d like now to introduce the panel , and please hold your applause until all six of our panelists are introduced . For the motion , first , the Vice-President at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross ; Senior Fellow in the Center for Religious Freedom at the Hudson Institute , Paul Marshall ; and Professor in the practice of Journalism at Georgetown University School of Continuing Studies and former Wall Street Journal reporter , Asra Nomani . Against the motion , Assistant Professor of Creative Writing at the University of California , Riverside , and Fellow at the University of Southern California Center on Public Diplomacy , Reza Aslan ; Professor of History at Columbia University , Richard Bulliet ; and Director of Communications for the Muslim Public Affairs Council , Edina Lekovic . Those are our six panelists . First , opening statements to be delivered from the podium and the order of presentation begins with Paul Marshall , speaking for the motion – seven minutes . </s>
With one minute left you’ll hear me say , “one , ” which will be a warning . Good . Okay , thank you very much for inviting us all this evening and thank you for being here . We in favor of this motion argue that Islam is dominated by radicals . </s>
What do we mean by radicals ? We mean those who are striving for a political order representing a reactionary version of Islam that denies legal and civic equality to men and women and also denies it on the basis of religion . </s>
It also denies freedom of speech and freedom of thought . We believe such trends , such people , currently dominate world Islam . Let us be quite clear about what we are not arguing . </s>
We are not arguing that Islam itself is inherently radical . Like any other movement , Islam takes different forms at different times . Also , we are not arguing that most Muslims are radical . Most are not . </s>
But what we are saying is that it is the radicals who have their hands on the levers of power . They are , to pick a word , the hegemonic . They’re the most powerful driving force . They’re tending to set the direction and shaping the future of Islam in the modern world . </s>
They do this not because they have superior numbers , but because they are extremely focused in what they want . They’re clear about it . They are often well organized . </s>
They’re often very well funded , often by Saudi Arabia and they are very , very committed , being quite willing to often kill themselves and to kill other people , especially Muslims . So this is what we’re arguing . To illustrate this I just want to show some of the trends which we have seen in the world in the last twenty-five to thirty years . </s>
Some twenty-nine years ago , of the major Muslim countries in the world only one -- Saudi Arabia - maintained that its political and constitutional order was a reflection of what it regards as original Islam and that it has accepted no foreign or infidel accretions . Saudi Arabia was , and is , one of the world’s most repressive states . Many , many examples could be given but I just mention one recent incident when three Saudi intellectuals sent a petition to the king – a petition asking for a gradual move towards a constitutional government . They were charged with using – I quote – un-Islamic terminology . </s>
The un-Islamic terminology they used in their petition included the word human rights and democracy . </s>
So we have the situation of Saudi some thirty years ago . Then in February of 1979 , the Ayatollah Komeini overthrows the Shah and establishes a draconian regime in Iran , which also since then has become one of the most repressive regimes in the world . It bars anybody who is not a Muslim from having any authority over a Muslim . It bars Muslims who do not support the regime’s version of Islam from running for political office . One other example : In Iran , if you kill someone who is a member of one of the non-listed religions , non-recognized religions – say , such as the Baha’is – there is no punishment . </s>
To kill a dog , a cat or a Baha’i is the same thing . It is no matter of the law because they have no legal status . </s>
They do not religiously and politically exist . Similarly , for sexual relations between a non-Muslim man and a Muslim woman , the penalty for the non-Muslim is death . And of course , the penalty for homosexuals of whatever religion is death . </s>
A new proposed penal code has been presented to the Iranian Parliament which would institutionalize its current practice that it would require with no possibility of reprieve , annulment that the penalty for heresy or for apostasy -- leaving Islam -- is death . Article 112 of this , this penal code also emphasizes the law will be extraterritorial . This means , incidentally , if this law is in fact passed , under Iranian law Barack Obama should be executed as an apostate . With the development of Iran next door to them , the Saudis redoubled their own efforts to export their own version of radical Islam . </s>
They proclaim themselves , on many occasions , the Muslim Vatican -- a very un-Muslim term -- and now , by most best estimates , spend some three billion dollars exporting their radical version of Islam around the world . </s>
That’s somewhat more , that’s about three times as much as the Soviet Union used for ideological purposes at the height of its power . If one travels to a moderate Muslim country , such as Indonesia , or if you travel throughout Africa , you will find Saudi-funded mosques , Imams , lectures , sermons , students , books , videos , fatwas propagating its own reactionary version of Islam . The Iranians seek to do the same . One result of this , though there are homegrown radical movements , with this organizational push behind them , one sees the growth of radical Islam throughout the world . Some examples : when Pakistan was founded it was not founded – </s>
One . …as an Islamic country . The Ali Jinnah – the man who founded the country -- said , whether you’re a Muslim or you’re a non- Muslim is no matter of the state . But now they have introduced blasphemy laws , which include the death penalty , particularly used on religious minorities . In Sudan , the government has instituted laws and propagated genocidal wars against the south in Darfur , killing some two million and two hundred and fifty thousand , respectively . </s>
In Nigeria , some fifty thousand people have died in conflict over the introduction of radical Islam . We see this phenomena repeated throughout the world and one could give very many more examples . One sees it even in , growing in Malaysia and Indonesia – historically very moderate countries . </s>
One result is that in Freedom House’s rankings of the world’s twenty un-free countries , the majority now are Muslim . </s>
Paul Marshall , thank you very much for your opening statement , in support of the motion -- Okay , the crucial confluence of ideas is not between the West and the Muslim world – -- Islam is dominated by radicals . …it is within the Muslim world . </s>
Thank you . Thank you . Now the first opening statement opposed to the motion : Islam is dominated by radicals . </s>
The speaker is Reza Aslan . There is something peculiar about the way that this debate tonight is being worded . The idea that we could , from our comfortable perches here in Manhattan , pass judgment on the beliefs and practices of a billion and a half people in every corner of the world . And despite Mr. Marshall’s comments , we’re not here to talk about whether Saudi Arabia or Iran is dominated by radicals . </s>
We’re here to talk about whether Islam is dominated by radicals . So I suppose it’s not surprising that a large percentage of people in this room would believe that Islam – unquestionably the most eclectic , the most diverse religion in the history of the world – is dominated by radicals . </s>
After all , no field work or research is necessary to come to such a conclusion – just turn on your television , watch your nightly news . Now , of course , we’re not children in this room . We all recognize that the purpose of commercial news is to sell commercials – which , by the way , is why I only get my news from NPR , Robert . Thank you , yes . </s>
And what sells commercials , of course , is violence and terror . You all know this . So then if there are violent protests about , let’s say , against deliberately provocative cartoons of the prophet Mohammed in a Danish newspaper , that’s a story . </s>
However , if a racist politician in The Netherlands makes a movie – we’re talking about Geert Wilders here -- makes a movie comparing the Koran to Mein Kampf and requesting its abolishment in the entire country and no protests erupt , the lack of protest is not a story . </s>
There is simply no story . Similarly , if the Pope makes some controversial comments about the prophet Mohammed and there are mass protests on the street , that’s a story . </s>
If the Pope goes to Turkey and no mass protests erupt , it’s not that the lack of protests is a story . There is no story . </s>
And I can tell you because I was there with CNN . Of course , much of this debate tonight – and in…and indeed , much of the debate about Islam in general is based not only on the media but on firsthand anecdotal evidence provided by , quote/unquote , insiders . And I’m sure you’ll hear plenty of that tonight from Asra and Daveed . How the experiences of the colleagues for the motion in confronting radicals in their own communities has given them the knowledge necessary to judge the beliefs and practices of a billion and a half people , I’m not sure . I will say that if I based my views of Catholicism on the stories that I hear from my former Catholic friends and on the media reports about Catholicism , I’d pretty much have to assume that Catholicism is dominated by sadistic pederasts . </s>
But of course that’s not true . So then I suppose the real question here is why do we keep asking pundits and politicians and writers and public intellectuals what Muslims think ? </s>
Why don’t we just simply ask Muslims themselves ? </s>
This is , after all , not so arduous a task . In fact , the Gallop organization – the most trusted polling organization in the world -- has already done the work for us by conducting the largest , most comprehensive poll of the Muslim world ever done . According to that poll , a mere seven percent of the world’s Muslims – not Arabs – seven percent of the world’s Muslims believe that the attacks of 9/11 were justified . </s>
Now , more interestingly , Gallop went a little bit further and actually asked those seven percent why they believe the attacks were justified . And the responses fly in the face of conventional wisdom . For example , in Indonesia – the largest Muslim country in the world , and frankly , quite a pluralistic and successful democracy -- not a single respondent , not a single respondent in Indonesia cited the Koran as justification for the attacks of 9/11 . Indeed , seventy- four percent of Indonesians , eighty-six percent of Pakistanis , eighty-one percent of Bangladeshis and eighty percent of Iranians said that attacks against civilians were , quote , never justified -- never . </s>
Now , please compare that to forty-six percent of Americans who said the same . In fact , the Gallop poll found that in all Muslim countries the majority of those Muslims who , quote/unquote , support violence or what we can refer to as radical views or tendencies do so for markedly secular – that is , political – reasons . Robert Pape found similar tendencies in his comprehensive study of suicide bombing . He found that ninety-five percent of all suicide terrorism is , quote , not driven by religion as much as by clear strategic – read , political – objectives . </s>
In short , when we talk about radicalism in the Muslim world we are talking about political radicalism , which after all , in a globalized world is not that odd . Why are these political goals so often couched in the language of religion – and in this case – One . …the language of Islam ? </s>
Well , it’s because in every society religion holds the most currency with the masses . In every society religion provides a powerful language to create simple collective identities and to urge collective action . In every society the language of religion has the power to distill the most complex sociopolitical issues into the simplest of choices – good versus evil , us versus them . As I say , this is true of every society , ours especially . And if you don’t believe me , I suggest you ask Karl Rove . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Reza Aslan , for that opening statement . </s>
Now , speaking in support of the motion : Islam is dominated by radicals , Asra Nomani . So I would say assalamu alaykum to all of you , but according to the prayer book that I was handed when I went on the pilgrimage to Saudi Arabia , I’m not allowed to say this peaceful greeting to those who aren’t Muslim . When I see that headline : Islam is dominated by radicals , I don’t hesitate in believing it to be true . </s>
The opposite side wants to suggest that we can’t tell you stories from the trenches . But it is , in fact , in the trenches where we know what is happening , that we know that the radicals are , in fact , intimidating , silencing and paralyzing the moderates . I know it from my lifetime in the Muslim community and I know it from stories and anecdotes , sure , and historical and country cases . When I was given this proposition I asked my mother – a grandmother , who has taught me my Muslim prayers , who is teaching her grandchildren the prayers – I said , Do you think that Islam is dominated by radicals ? </s>
You can dismiss her as an anecdote . You can dismiss her as somebody who isn’t pundit enough but she’s got her finger on the pulse of what’s going on in our communities . And she didn’t hesitate in saying yes . </s>
For the last thirty years that I have known , since the exportation of Wahabiism from Saudi Arabia to the far reaches of our Muslim world , I know that our community is dominated by radical ideology . I know that it is an ideology that has taken root in countries from Pakistan to states in Nigeria to provinces in Indonesia with laws that put women in second class status , that give women criminal punishments because of sexual crimes . </s>
In each instance you could say that there’s a political purpose . </s>
But at the end of the day it is done in the name of Islam . I don’t stand up here and condemn my faith . I fight for it every single day . I fight for a progressive interpretation of our faith . But at the end of the day our religion , our institutional Islam out there in the world -- from my home town of Morgantown , West Virginia to Islamabad , Pakistan to Indonesia to Riyadh , Saudi Arabia – we are controlled and dominated by radical ideology . </s>
The moderates don’t want to lose their status . </s>
They don’t want to lose their place in the community . </s>
They don’t want to lose their invitation to the potluck dinner parties and wedding halls that they get to go to . It’s an issue of social dynamics . At the end of the day it isn’t worth it to them to take on the radical ideology because there’s too much at stake . </s>
You risk your own safety and then you risk your social standing . I know this as a woman in the faith . I know that what we are struggling with is a situation where more mosques in America than in the 1990s are putting women in separate sections . Two-thirds of mosques in America versus half in the 1990s have women separated . And you could argue that that’s not radical ideology . </s>
But at the end of the day it is part of a continuum of an interpretation of Islam that takes a literal read that says a woman is sexual temptation , that a woman is sexual distraction . </s>
You take that interpretation and it isn’t that long that you have to also add up to an interpretation that says that you can’t be friends with the Jews and the Christians , that violence is acceptable . Why do I know this ? Because I’ve heard it from my pulpit . I’ve heard it from the sermons that are downloaded on college campuses across this country and across the world . There is an exportation of this ideology . </s>
We may watch our borders , we may check the visas of people who come into this country but I know that there is an ideology that says that a woman is half the witness of a man in criminal cases , that that is law in countries of our , of our religion , that there is interpretation that says that a woman gets less inheritance . When we put women -- half of our population , in particular -- in second class status around the world , you can call it anything you want . </s>
But I consider it unacceptable and I call it radical ideology . It’s unacceptable to have tradition become religion with female genital mutilation . It’s unacceptable to have honor killings , as we are , from Canada to Texas to Turkey . You can call those anecdotes but it’s a trend . </s>
It’s a trend that’s happening because our Islam of today is dominated by radicals . We don’t have mosque leaders who are keeping that kind of ideology in check . We are , in fact , having leaders who accept preaching from the pulpit that says that we can not imitate the dis-believers , that we can not say assalamu alaykum to those who are not Muslim . At the end of the day what I want you to know is that I stand up for Islam as a faith . I stand up for the principles just like every other religion . </s>
But like Judaism and Christianity have evolved so that there is a continuum in institutional religion , so that there is a reform synagogue along with the orthodox synagogue , our mosques are defined by an institutional puritanical interpretation that to me is very radical and very unacceptable . </s>
And I encourage you to vote to support this motion because we need a truth telling . We need to be honest . One . We need to not cower in the face of political correctness . </s>
A lot of you may have hesitation because you think that if you vote for the motion you are voting and condemning Islam . I don’t stand here before you saying that that is at all on the table . We can stand up for religion that is not dominated by radicals , but we can accept the fact when it is . And in our day , in the trenches in the Muslim world from a mosque just a few blocks away from here to Seattle , Washington to Dubai , we are facing a momentum where the leadership is one that accepts radical ideology and the moderates don’t stand up against it . </s>
So I encourage you to vote for the motion and understand that it’s a vote for truth . Thank you . Thank you , Asra Nomani . And now , an opening statement against the motion from Edina Lekovic . </s>
I will bid you assalamu alaykum , because that is what my faith teaches me and that , regardless of who is in the pulpit , is what the book teaches . When we consider the question of whether Islam is dominated by radicals we have to look in terms of absolute numbers and in terms of prominence and in terms of symbols . Saying that Islam is dominated by radicals is much like saying , is as absurd as saying that America is dominated by murderers . </s>
Certainly they exist within our society and certainly radicals exist within the fold of Islam . But do they dominate ? Absolutely not . Based on the polling data that Reza shared with you and based on so much other data that exists out there , the people on the Muslim streets , both in the West and in the , quote/unquote , Muslim world , are striving for freedom , for freedom of speech , for democracy , for technology , for those very things that they admire the West for . </s>
That is what their faith is pushing them to do . Now , Islam is dominated , if you will , by scholars , by average people more so than anyone else , who are struggling to understand Islam in a 21st Century context and who seek to foster inclusion of Muslims on the international stage and who want nothing more than to be understood and to be respected , as that same poll showed over and over again . </s>
To point to Saudi Arabia over and over again , I will hand that to the other side . Saudi Arabia is no , by no means the shining glory of any part of the Muslim world . But pointing to pockets in no way reflects the overall picture , the overall reality . </s>
Looking in a pocket or in many pockets in no way represents the overall cost to , the overall character of the people and it is the people who define the faith and who define their global community . The reality is that the moral – You know , when we look at where this radical threat lies -- I travel across this country and around the world . We can fight anecdotes with anecdotes . When I was in Malaysia a few years ago talking to youth on the streets there , their single goal was to be understood . They wondered why Americans didn’t understand them and why Americans thought that they were all terrorists . </s>
When I traveled to Egypt it was the same . When I traveled even to Bosnia , to the former Yugoslavia where my parents are from , it was very much the same . The lack of understanding on both sides of the issue has in many ways been fueled by media perceptions as we have described here earlier . The reality on the ground is this : radicals are failing in their attempt to dominate . </s>
Radicals , those who make up Al Qaeda and its various branches , are on the run . They are in decline . </s>
Their messages are not reaching the audiences that they seek to convert and to brainwash as much as they used to . And that , to me , is an important symbol of the rise of moderation , the rise of the middle , the rise of those who dominate this faith . Even those in Al Qaeda – Ayman al-Zawahiri , who recently released a tape – they have had to change their tactics because they are receiving criticism from within the Muslim community . They have had to respond to criticism about targeting civilians and have had to answer these questions to the very people that they are trying to recruit . And if we look even at the reality in the , quote/unquote -- and I say again , quote/unquote -- Muslim world , look even to Pakistan , where we saw that the radicals indeed killed Bhutto . </s>
But what did the people do in response ? They elected a secular government . They responded in a different way . The people on the ground are the ones who are defining the face and the nature and the character of the faith and of the global Muslim community . </s>
And again , what do they want ? That’s what we have to remember . They do not want death and destruction . </s>
They want hope , they want economic ability , they want education and they want a seat at the table . If we also look to the , where the war against radicals is taking place , it’s almost entirely in the Islamic world , between mainstream societies and governments on the one hand and radical minorities on the other hand . Just look at what Muslim scholars and Muslim leaders have been able to achieve in the last few years and then we’ll ask ourselves , Why haven’t we heard about it ? In 2005 Jordan’s King Abdullah convened an international Islamic conference of two hundred of the world’s most leading Islamic scholars from fifty different countries . </s>
Those scholars unanimously issued a ruling on three fundamental issues – the validity of all interpretations of Islam , the eight legal schools . They forbade the declaration of apostasy between Muslims and they further provided pre-conditions to issuing fatwas , since they have become such a currency on the international market and have lost their meaning entirely . That’s one example . </s>
Another is that a hundred and thirty-eight Muslim scholars joined together to affirm freedom of expression -- scholars from around the world – and to condemn the negative reactions to the Danish cartoons – and which resulted , I think , interestingly , of the fact that there was very little , if – very little reaction to the most recent Danish , episode , if you will , of the film Fitna . </s>
And those same scholars reached out to the Pope to establish a historic Muslim/Catholic forum… One . …seeking opportunities for dialogue that they could do on an international scale at the level of leadership and that could also be modeled for their citizens and their countries and for the faithful among them who wanted to see something different take place . Internationally recognized leaders are calling for integration , for tolerance and for advancement . </s>
And their reach is ten times wider at least than that of Al Qaeda or any of their associates . Just consider those , even in Turkey , which has recently elected a new government but has taken the lead in ushering in a historic re-examining of Islamic material to cater to the contemporary world . That is just one among countless examples of people who are working day in , day out to re-emerge as the dominant force within their faith and who are crying out for attention on the world stage . Just consider this last example , which is that , what – </s>
I’m sorry . We’ll have to hear the last example later . Thank you very much . Where do the cameras turn ? That’s the question . </s>
Edina Lekovic . Thank you , Edina Lekovic , for that statement in support of the motion : Islam is dominated by radicals . A couple of questions from me . </s>
Quickly , first for Paul Marshall . Uh , if , as you argue , uh , Islam is dominated by radicals , uh , why aren’t Indonesia , Malaysia , Bangladesh , uh , uh , or for that matter , hundreds—tens of millions of Muslims in India , all knuckling unto , uh , under to jihadist movements , and creating Islamic revolutions in those country , why don’t—why haven’t we seen more Islamic revolutions . Because most Muslims don’t like the radicals’ agenda . But— They’re not dominated by it— </s>
Precisely . Well , no , I think if people have guns , if they have intim—if they intimidate people , if they’re organized , if they have funding , if one sees even in Indonesia the increase in radical movements , radical Islam— radical imams , who were not there 10 , 20 , 15 years ago . When you see in Indonesia the destruction of hundreds of churches , where 10 years in Indonesia , 20 years ago you wouldn’t— would never have seen that , people coexisted . So even in places like Indonesia , in places like Bangladesh , in places like Malaysia , even though most of the people don’t want it , you have the growth of radical movements , and they often win , because they intimidate and scare other people— </s>
Paul Marshall— Okay , more— Paul Marshall knows that those churches are primarily Chinese- owned , and the Chinese form a socioeconomic community in Indonesia that has been at great odds with the majority Muslim population there and that a lot of those churches are not religious violence . It’s ethnic , social violence , but more importantly , again , you know , here we go , we’re—we’re talking about this idea of , of domination— </s>
By the way , most of the churches are non-ethnic Chinese . The majority of Christians in Indonesia are Chinese . Are of Chinese ethnicity— And you— It is— </s>
— that Laskar jihad does not justify its attacks that way , it , it’s— No , no , of course not— —it’s just not a general religious war against Christians— </s>
But lots of—but again they don’t dominate— It’s just the primary group responsible for , for that violence— But that’s the point—is that , they do not dominate either the discussion about Islam in Indonesia , or the society of Indonesia or the government , we’re talking— there’s one country in the world— I agree with you and Edina that they don’t dominate the discussions , the conferences , when people— Then what do they dominate— </s>
—get together— Right . —but those don’t have much effect . </s>
No , what , what— The people— —the people with professors , every time . What do they dominate— </s>
They dominate actions . What I thought was really— </s>
Asra Nomani— </s>
—interesting—what I thought was really interesting was that , Edina , you even talked about the moderates reemerging as the dominant force in the faith , an acknowledgement that they are not the dominant faith— </s>
—I want to hear Edina answer the question from Asra Nomani— I would like to just make the point that , talk is great to point out , this is not a popularity contest of what Muslims mostly think . I mean this is about our institutional faith , if you ask me . </s>
When we talk about whether Islam is dominated by radicals , domination to me is , do they have leadership in our communities , and are they taking action that is representative of a violent strain of Islam and I’d say yes . Asra Nomani , thanks , and Edina Lekovic— Let me ask you a specific question— Sure— —by the way you spoke of Saudi Arabia as a pocket that we shouldn’t take as representative any more than murderers in America should be representative of American life . </s>
Wouldn’t you concede that the role of Saudi Arabia , and Iran for that matter , on the global stage , is far disproportionate to their numerical position in Islam , they have influence beyond their own borders , right— Absolutely , but let’s consider also where that comes from , let’s consider the kind of US support that Saudi Arabia also gets in , you know , in reciprocity . But what does— </s>
Now in no way …do I place any sort of validity or endorsement on the Saudi ideology . Is it out there , are there’s Korans out there that we fight problems with , absolutely . But even the Saudi people would disagree in large part with what their government is doing , and there is no foundation whatsoever for the kinds of , you know , of distorted perceptions of faith that they’re spreading on the ground . And that in no way represents the global reality of Islam . Again , looking at pockets and trying to turn them into global realities , we have to recognize and reinforce the majority . </s>
So that is—and that’s precisely what has happened since 9-11 which is the point that I was trying to make , that’s where the reemergence is taking place . </s>
We have much more to come , we still have two opening statements yet to hear , and we’re going to resume those now , speaking for the motion , “Islam is dominated by radicals , ” is Daveed Gartenstein-Ross . Daveed . It’s important before you cast your vote in this debate to think carefully about the resolution , and to think carefully about the way that we defined it . As we said in our very first speech , we support the proposition that Islam is dominated by radicals , and we define radicalism in relation to human equality . </s>
In the Muslim world , is there belief in equality between religions ? Is there belief in equality between genders ? </s>
Is there support for basic freedoms , like freedom of speech , and freedom of religion ? </s>
The other side has not addressed these issues . Instead they’ve changed the subject , speech after speech , and defined this resolution only with respect to violence . There’s a reason that in neither of our previous two speeches , did we talk about violence , I’ll talk about it a little bit here because they’re bringing it up . </s>
But they haven’t refuted any of our basic arguments about how human equality is not being met in the Muslim world . We’ve talked about it in two different ways , we’ve talked about equality in terms of freedom of religion , and we’ve talked about equality of gender and they’ve said not one word on it . Their last speech , I have to say , is a little late to do so . </s>
The reason this is important , is because we need to understand the severity of the problem . The reason we need to understand this , is because , if , in fact , the Muslim world is dominated by moderates and neo-progressives who are going to usher in a new era of prosperity and freedom , then there’s not much that we in the West need to do about it . </s>
But if on the other hand , radicals are ascendant , then we need to play a bigger role , and we need to put greater emphasis on this corner of the world . So the way we think about it fundamentally matters , and it matters to those who are suffering under totalitarian systems . Now , look at the key areas of the debate . Look at freedom of religion . This is something that affects people . </s>
In 14 Muslim countries , right now , it is illegal to change your religion , in eight of these countries , it is punishable by death . </s>
That is , you can not convert out of Islam in these countries . That does not support equality between religions . This is supported also , by anti-proselytism laws , laws that prevent people from other faiths from propagating their own faiths , while at the same time Saudi money goes out throughout the entire globe , propagating a Wahabist version of Islam . This also is supported by anti-blasphemy laws . </s>
Laws that are used to suppress people who have a view of religion that does not conform with the very stringent view that a state might have . Now they have a couple of arguments here . One argument they made is polls . Now unfortunately , their argument about the polls which is trying to give you a broader view , only deals with violence . </s>
Well let’s talk about polling a little bit . One recent poll , by Policy Exchange that was undertaken in Britain back in 2006 shows that a shocking 36 percent of British Muslims between the ages of 16 and 24 , said that someone who converts from Islam to another faith , should be punished by death . </s>
That’s within the West , you get a 36 percent support for this . Now , 36 percent obviously is not a majority . </s>
But what it shows , is the hegemony , as we framed it , of radicals , the fact that these ideas are seeping into the West , where people are familiar with Western customs , Western freedoms , and have had a chance to live in them . </s>
Now , the odd—but , and another thing about the polls incidentally , is they’re not necessarily as benign as the other side makes them out to be . For example , a recent poll conducted by Pew found that 15 percent of Indonesians support—believe that violence in defense of Islam is justified . Well 15 percent isn’t a whole lot . </s>
But when you look at Indonesia which is the world’s most populous Muslim country , you’re talking about 25 million people . I find that number to be a bit disturbing . And it’s out of line with what you’d find comparably Christians saying , in terms of whether defense of their faith is justified , whether violence is justified , in terms of defense of Christianity . </s>
Now , that is relevant to assessing whether this resolution is correct . </s>
Now , moving on to other arguments that they made , Edina says , don’t look at pockets , people define the faith . Well that’s non- responsive , because from the very first speech onward , we have said , that the majority of Muslims do not support radicalism . Rather , it’s that radicals enjoy hegemony , via institutions , via the propagation of the faith . And Edina actually gives up the game in her speech , because she concedes that Saudi Arabia is radical . </s>
Remember , folks , we’re not talking about Al Qaeda here . The question is not whether Muslims support Al Qaeda , it’s not whether Al Qaeda has hegemony , it’s radicals . And Saudi Arabia today , is the biggest country in terms of propagating a view of Islam . </s>
And one reason that Reza , uh , feared that I might talk about my view from the trenches , is that in a previous incarnation before I was in counterterrorism , I was working for a Saudi Arabian charity and actually got somewhat radicalized by them , it’s in—in a book that you can read somewhere or other . </s>
But the point is that , I’ve seen Saudi propaganda from the inside . And Saudi propaganda does take root . If you look at countries— and this is something that Paul talked about in the very first speech . </s>
If you look at countries from Bosnia to Indonesia to Somalia , countries that for a long time had a very moderate practice of Islam . As Saudi money has gone in there , and as you’ve had these institutions , these mosques , these charitable organizations , the practice of Islam has fundamentally shifted . Things are not gon na get better on their own . </s>
Because , look at the price of oil . Saudi Arabia is the world’s biggest exporter of oil , in addition to the being the world’s biggest exporter of radical ideology . And the price of oil is skyrocketing . Over $ 100 a barrel , you have Hugo Chavez and others talking about how it should be $ 200 a barrel . That’s not unrealistic . </s>
And with this power , with this oil money , you’ll see these radical ideas continue to take shape . </s>
Saudi Arabia is a powerful country . </s>
In conceding that Saudi Arabia is radical , they fundamentally concede that this debate is not about Al Qaeda . It’s about the radical institutions . And those radical institutions are indeed taking foot . </s>
She says look at the Muslim scholars . She says that they affirm freedom of expression , and condemned the riots over the Danish cartoons . But look at what the Organization of the Islamic Conference did , the OIC . In response to the Danish cartoons , they— </s>
One . </s>
—pushed for a ban in the UN . </s>
They said that there should be a new law to prevent cartoons like that coming up ever again . </s>
These are cartoons that were published in the West . And the Islamic countries believe that it’s their right to make sure that the West alters its precept of free speech , to conform with norms that would be more suitable . That is why we’re saying , that radicals have hegemonic power , and that’s why you should vote for this resolution . </s>
Thank you , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross , for that opening statement in support of the motion and now speaking against the motion , “Islam is dominated by radicals , ” Richard Bulliet . </s>
Good evening . </s>
I think we can agree with most of what our opponents have said . </s>
Just not with the proposition . </s>
We can agree that Saudi Arabia is not a place that most of us would particularly want to live . Saudis like to live there . But they have a version of Islam , that is repugnant to many Americans , we can agree with that . We can agree that , Saudi Arabia , both privately and publicly , puts a lot of money into trying to spread their version of Islam , this is what Mr. Marshall referred to as striving for a political order that represents a reactionary version of Islam—yes . Saudis are trying to do that . </s>
There are some other groups , around the world who are trying to do that . And some of them get money from the Saudis . </s>
We’re not going to deny that . We’re not going to deny that women in many Muslim countries face what Asra said was an unacceptable situation . Yeah , they do . Many others don’t , but many do . Nor are we going to claim that religious equality or enjoyment of human rights as we understand them in this country are universal in the Muslim world . </s>
We’re not going to complain—to…raise an issue on any of this . But that is what the proposition is . Proposition is , the radicals dominate Islam . </s>
Now we’ve heard other words like , hegemony . After all , as Daveed just said , 36 percent of British Muslims think that apostasy deserves death , and that’s hegemony—well , not by my count . 36 percent is 36 percent . </s>
You want a majority if you want hegemony . The fact that in Britain , virtually all of the Muslims come from one particular , rather benighted part of Pakistan—and do not in any way , by any measure , represent a cross-section of the Muslim world— should also be taken into account . See , the problem is , and let me go back to Mr. Rosenkranz’s very opening remarks . He was talking about numbers that showed that in Muslim countries around the world you have a lot of people who are anti-American . We do , yeah . </s>
Well , you know…that I don’t think is un-understandable . But the question is whether that has anything to do with Islam . Or whether that is objecting to American policies . Now , if you want to say that anyone who objects to US government actions is by definition a radical , well then maybe you get somewhere but even then I don’t think so because , what has not been talked about here , is the fact that most of the countries in the Muslim world , are not governed by Muslim regimes . They’re governed by autocratic dictatorships . </s>
Most of the political activity of Muslims , that gives rise to strong political statements has to do with opposing living under totalitarianism . </s>
Most of the people in the Muslim world , have not , nor did their parents , nor will their grandchildren in all likelihood , had any opportunity , to participate in or choose the government under what they live . Now , the fact of the matter is , that when they object to autocratic rule , two things happen . One is , that they fall back on their religious faith , and say , well , Islam can help us against this autocracy , the second one is , they say , who is supporting the dictatorships that we live in . Lo and behold , say it’s the United States . So that when you have Muslims objecting to US policies , it’s more frequently that they are objecting to the support the United States gives to autocratic rule , whether it is in Egypt , or in Saudi Arabia , or in Pakistan . </s>
This is the crux of the matter in the Muslim world . You don’t have…most Muslims in the Muslim world are not sitting there trying to decide whether they want a Saudi , conservative , Puritanical version of Islam , or whether they want , you know , Reza Aslan to be the Muslim pope , I mean this is not— This is not where the debate is , it isn’t about what Islam is like . Good debate though . Good debate , yeah . What it’s about , is a billion people , two-thirds of whom do not live in democratic systems , and who are looking to their tradition and their faith tradition , to try to work for a better life , and a more participatory role , in the polities that they live in . </s>
And they find that , Islam is satisfying to them as a political option . It isn’t the option that most of us would choose but we do know that in this country , we do have many Americans , who feel that religion is part of their political life . </s>
Unless I miss my guess , this accounts for a big chunk of the Republican party . But we sort of say , well , okay , here in New York we don’t particularly like to talk about those people , but— One . —nevertheless , the fact of the matter is that these people find satisfaction in their turn to religion as an effort to stand up against autocracy , and they find that the American support for autocrats is reprehensible . And they discover that in the American way of things there will be enormous publicity given to anything negative about Islam , not just by the American press , but because the various autocrats will feed the American government and the American press negative things because they’re trying to protect the privileged position that they have set up over the last 50 years of totalitarian rule . </s>
And therefore I would say that , if there’s anything that’s dominating in the Muslim world , not dominating in Islam but dominating in the Muslim world , it’s dictatorship . Not radical Muslims . </s>
Richard Bulliet , thank you very much for your opening statement . Before the panelists put questions to one another I have a couple of questions , and first , Richard Bulliet . Would you agree or disagree with the statement that Muslim clergy worldwide is dominated by people who would want to see Islamic law imposed in their societies and would prefer to live in a society under Islamic law , do you think it’s true or false or no way of knowing . Oh , I think that’s false , I held a conference a number of years ago , exclusively devoted to Muslim political activists , held it in Iman , Jordan . </s>
And one of the issues that we were supposed to discuss was the idea of an Islamic republic . There wasn’t a single person there . They were Muslim political activists— ? Yes they were , they were from the Muslim Brotherhood , they were from the Dawa party , they’re from the SCIRI party . They were from a whole series of Muslim political parties in the Middle East . </s>
Mm-hmm . </s>
And none of them supported the idea of an Islamic republic . </s>
Hmm . And you believe that from a group whose message was the Koran is our Constitution— Daveed Gartenstein-Ross . I mean , the Muslim Brotherhood is very clear on what their goals are . </s>
Hassan al-Banna , talked about this , — It was in the 1930s— —Islamic state , and— Yes , but— —their motto remains , the Koran is our Constitution— </s>
You’re mistaking the 1930s or the 1950s with the Muslim Brotherhood today— </s>
Okay , Mohammed— —talks about pluralism primarily . I have a question for Daveed Gartenstein-Ross , before—you’ll goad each other in just a moment here and I’ll— Okay— Okay , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross , you seem to cite as evidence of the fact that Muslims are dominated by radicals , the desire to see restrictions in Europe on freedom of speech that included cartoons that Muslims deemed blasphemous . </s>
In Europe , in Britain for that matter , there are laws that restrict incitement to race hate , which we find a violation of our First Amendment , do you believe that laws that ban punishment of racist or anti- Semitic or anti-Islamist images or literature—that to support such laws is a mark of an extremist , or in the context of Europe , is it a part of the way in which the law has developed there that has not created fascist societies in France , Italy and Britain recently— Well , you have to parse some of those laws , I mean there’s the racial incitement laws which is one thing , and I don’t have a problem with racial incitement laws . </s>
Then there’s vilification laws . </s>
Vilification laws are adopted in some countries , France and Italy are examples . </s>
Most countries in Europe do not have it , including Britain . I do think—in terms of those , it’s debatable as to why a country would have it , whether it’s evidence of radicalism . </s>
But I think saying that every country in the world should adopt a certain law to limit speech in the case of religion , is evidence of radicalism— But if a religious movement pressed for universal laws that would ban degrading images or comments about their faith , would you take that as per se a mark of extremism on behalf of that faith— Not—not per se a mark of extremism , I agree with that but I think that contextually I would define it as such , it looks like Paul has something he wants to— </s>
Paul Marshall , you have something to add— Yeah , depends what the government is , you have through the Organization of Islamic Confernce an effort going on , since about 1999 , to repress through the international system , to repress speech it says is critical of Islam , or blasphemous . Pakistan has been big on this , Iran has been big on this , the Saudis have been big on this . </s>
Remember , example , brief example I gave before is Saudi democracy activists are accused of blasphemy . In Iran , Akbar Gangi , the major dissident , was accused of insulting Islam . </s>
Domestically these repressive regimes use charges of blasphemy to squelch the opposition , basically they say , we represent Islam , you criticize us , you criticize Islam , you’re a blasphemer . When these regimes try to pushy this into the international sphere I think it should be strongly opposed . But when you have autocratic regimes— </s>
And Richard Bulliet— —that ban parties that use religion and so forth , you don’t object to that . </s>
The Egyptians will not allow a religious party , the Turks , you know , through constitutional court , they’re now trying to ban the governing party there , I mean… I don’t like that either— A governing—a governing party by the way which calls itself Islamist and yet , has brought seven years of unprecedented economic growth , has brought Turkey closer to the United States and Israel than it’s ever been before , has given more freedoms and rights to minorities , and ethnic minorities than it has ever been before , but— They want to say that it’s okay if you’re a woman , and you want to go to college , you can put a scarf over your head , and , because of that , they’re seen as anti-democratic , as violating secularism , as , you know , again this awful world Islamist . </s>
So , you know , it’s not so easy to just kind of tag the Muslim Brotherhood or the AKP as though the Muslim Brotherhood by the way is one entity . According to something that was written in the 1930s , you know , by Hassan al-Banna— Well , I’ll quote the current guardian if you want . You can— </s>
Well , we can quote them as we go on through the evening . We can quote all of the Muslim Brethren before we’re done , but now , I’m sure you’ve all been wondering what the person next to you really thinks about all this . </s>
And now you’ll learn because I’m ready to announce the results of the pre- debate vote . </s>
Before you were moved by the speakers , you were asked your opinion of the motion , “Islam is dominated by radicals.” </s>
46 percent voted for the motion , 32 percent against , and 22 percent were undecided . </s>
Now we’re going to continue with the discussion section of the evening . I’m going to ask each of you if you have a question for an individual on the other side . And again , we’d like to hear a question put to the person on the other side and first I’m going to ask Paul Marshall , do you have a question for one of your adversaries here . Yes , Professor Bulliet . In arguing , you opposed our use of the word “hegemony , ” and said when , say , 30 percent or so of British Muslim youth want to kill someone who rejects Islam , or believes they should be killed , you said that’s not a majority , hegemony equals majority . </s>
But , would you not agree that in the regimes we’re talking about , if one is talking about Egypt , or Saudi Arabia , or a vast number of other countries , the majority of the people may oppose something . But surely you would agree that currently the Saudi Arabian government is hegemonic , the Iranian government is hegemonic in terms of what shapes that country . Oh , I agree— Richard Bulliet . Yes , I mean— </s>
No , just stop there— The British— The British government isn’t , however , in that category . </s>
If you are going to say that the government in any autocratic state , whether it is Saudi Arabia , or Iran or Egypt , or Tunisia , or any of the other myriad autocratic states where the government calls the shots , yes . The government does call the shots and therefore you could say that the government has a dominating or hegemonic role but if you want to go down that route , then you find that most Muslims in the world aren’t living in those states that you’re worried about . They’re living in states that are governed by nationalists , secular , or self-proclaimed secular autocracies , so , you know , you can’t just single out Saudi Arabia and Iran , and say , this is the whole of the law and the prophets—it just doesn’t work that way . Question asked and answered , Reza Aslan , do you have a question for the other side , someone on the other side . </s>
Yes , I’ll ask this question of Daveed . I want to remind Daveed first of all that , according to Freedom’s House definition of democracies , the United States wasn’t a democracy until 1960 . But in that regard , Rice University two years ago did the most comprehensive study of American religiosity ever done . And in that study they found that not only do a third of Americans , one out of three refer to themselves as evangelical Christians , but 46 percent , that’s almost half of American Christians , believe that the Constitution and American laws should be changed in order to match Christian law and Christian values , so— </s>
Your question . —I imagine your response would be— No , do you or do you not then believe that America is under the “hegemony”…of evangelical Christians . So therefore we are dominated by radicals , correct ? Well— Daveed Gartenstein-Ross . </s>
—that would be a very relevant and interesting question if this were a different resolution . In the end the resolution isn’t whether the US is dominated by radicals or not . Now— </s>
No , I’m just curious about your answer— Only get one question , yes— I mean , looking at the specifics of it , it was 46 percent of 23 percent , I think , I don’t know , that seems to be about , 11 and a half percent , my math could be a little bit off , you kind of went on for a little while there . But what I will say is evidence of hegemony , is when— </s>
No , no , 46 percent of 300 million , not— 46 percent— —46 percent of 100— —of 300 million think that—well , I’d have to see the study , and one thing that I can say is that I think that in the evangelical community , which I’m a part of , there’s a lot of push-back against— I mean you were , you’re going on and on about the AKP , and I actually agree with you on the AKP , I don’t think they should be banned . </s>
But there’s a— there’s disagreement here but , I don’t think they should be banned— No , no , no , I just like Turkey . Okay— The AKP is the Turkish— The AKP is just— </s>
—Islamist Party— But , with respect to the United States , within the evangelical community there’s a lot of push-back against religion simply being pushed out of the sphere , the public sphere , 100 percent , that’s the way the First Amendment has been interpreted for some time . And I would say that some of the disturbing poll results are not evidence of radicalism but instead , this push- back— So it’s not hegemony— </s>
The question—the question is answered— </s>
Actually it wasn’t . </s>
And—well , it’s , — Actually it was , Reza , but I appreciate your— It is a sign of hegemony or it is not a sign of hegemony . Um— </s>
46 percent wanting to— Well actually I answered it— —to enforce Christianity— — which is that the question is not relevant . </s>
And I don’t know what way they’d wan na do it , I haven’t seen the poll results , I can’t judge . </s>
Thank you , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross . A question now , Asra Nomani , you can put a question to one of the opponents of the motion . Well , Edina said earlier that to suggest that radicals dominate -- as is our proposition there -- Islam is like saying that murderers define America . So , 22 countries are the number of countries that declare that Islam is the state religion . Of those , 14 say that conversion of Islam is illegal . </s>
The good professor suggested that in fact we are correct that , Islamic law in Saudi Arabia and all of these other countries suggest inequity . So my question to you , thank you— Good point . —is…the laws are defined by ideology that— represents inequity . Most of the countries are governed by Islamic states , in the name of Islam . </s>
How do you then argue that , there—the excuse is autocracies , that the equivalent is as if murderers were running America . </s>
These countries are not the—the leadership does not even proclaim to be running the country in the name of Islam . Again— Well , they have Islam as their state religion— If I can answer— —under Islamic law . </s>
You’ve asked the question . The answer ? The Islamic law has been on the books for a period of time in these countries . The leaders who are coming into the leadership , are dictators who are following upon the heels of dictators , and who are supported by international forces . The fact that these laws exist on the books , are indeed still problematic . </s>
No one on our side is denying any of that , these realities certainly exist on the ground . However , we have to look at where they are enforced and when they are enforced . </s>
Because even where Islamic law— and we try to take Sharia and turn it into , as if it’s “the” Sharia , that it’s a one-size-fits-all Sharia that exists in all of these countries , nothing could be further from the proof . There is different shapes and sizes and flavors of Sharia that exist in these different countries . So we can not pretend that they are all the same . So , in these situations , in some of these countries , even those rules around apostasy have long been unenforced . </s>
We have to look at where this rise has come from . And a lot of it , in my mind , is a very reactionary action that has taken place . </s>
And again , in no way defines what is taking place on the ground with the people , I do not know why we are once again , over and over again denying the realities of the people on the groined who make up the dominant force within Islam . Because this is not a homecoming queen contest . And no one said it was . </s>
Edina Lekovic , it’s your turn to put a question to any of the three supporters , movers of the motion . Well , my question is for Paul Marshall . </s>
Last week , General Petraeus testified before Congress and said that the Iraqi people are turning on Al Qaeda , and that they are fighting them , and that this is resulting in a reduced presence of Al Qaeda in Iraq . And that this is a—and we see this as a rare glimpse of success in our war policy . And pundits , and scholars , including journalists who have been on the ground , in some of the very countries that we are talking about , have also said that these— Al Qaeda being the prime example , but other radical groups on the ground , that their influence is also declining . Do you dispute that fact . Okay . </s>
Just one quick comment , Edina , you are being very unfair . </s>
As you know , I was on my honeymoon last week , and did not pay too much atten— I’m very jealous— …the only person who didn’t pay too much attention to what General Petraeus said . But the… I would be , I wouldn’t have enough knowledge of on the ground in Iraq to dispute that . </s>
But it may well be the case that sort of more radical forces , not just the Al Qaeda types , but the Mahdi army and these other groups , that the Iraqis are sort of getting fed up with them and resisting them . This may well be the case . And , obviously , I would regard that , I think most of us would regard that as a good thing . But it would not , for me , make a difference in terms of my overall view of dominant trends in the Muslim world , in Africa , Asia—south Asia , southeast Asia and so forth . A question now , from Daveed Gartenstein-Ross for one of the opponents of the resolution . </s>
All right , I’m going to ask it to Reza since we seem to be the two boxers of the bunch . And it will—my question will not go on and on and on , rather , it’s— </s>
And I’ll— —somewhat to the point— And I’ll actually answer it . Touché— You both set a very high standard for this event— </s>
It’s really impressive . So , I’m interested actually in your answer . </s>
You talked about the polls on violence during your first speech . My question is , first of all do you still find the raw numbers disturbing , I talked a bit about the Pew study on Indonesia , 15 percent equates to 25 million people who support violence in the name of the religion . </s>
And then second , do you find it disturbing , regardless of whether they name religion as one of their motivating factors for it , which was one of the points that you made as well . </s>
Actually what you said was 15 percent of Indonesians would resort to violence in defense of their religion , I can’t believe it’s as little as 15 percent . </s>
I would be shocked if it were less than 50 percent . Religion in every culture including ours , is not just beliefs and practices , it’s identity . And if someone were coming to my country to attack me , attack my identity , you’re damn right , I would resort to violence to deflect that attack . Now , you made the point that , we would assume that , ask a bunch of American Christians that same question and of course it—the number would be much less than 15 percent . </s>
I think you’re right . However , let’s ask a bunch of Christians— </s>
But , pugilistically , when Andres Serrano’s— Why don’t we— —Piss Christ came out , Christians weren’t rioting on the streets . </s>
Whereas with the Danish cartoons you had over 100 people killed throughout the world . </s>
Yeah , actually Nigerian Christians were massacring with machetes Muslims , just as Muslims were massacring Christians . But let me just say , it may be right that , you’re not going to get similar numbers of Christians if you ask let’s say Americans , but ask that question of Guatemalans . Ask that question of people in San Salvador . And I think you’re going to get a different answer . </s>
Religion is who you are , if who you are is under attack , you fight back , period , whether you’re a Christian , or whether you’re a Muslim . The reason that we—there are so few Americans who feel that way is— I mean saying that my religion is under attack because I can’t pray in my classroom , is not being under attack . As opposed to there being cartoons ridiculing your religion ? Yeah , as a matter of fact , yeah , as that’s— </s>
As a—oh , as a matter of fact , so you do think that it’s okay to riot in response to , you think that that’s okay— I think it’s perfectly okay to protest those cartoons . And to kill people ? </s>
No , but that’s— Over 100 people died . No , no , no , but that’s different , what you’re saying is , should I act in defense of my religion— Clearly , to commit acts of violence , it’s not act in defense of religion— Should I act—should I act violently— </s>
It’s commit acts of violence , that’s what the survey said— Should I act violently in defense of my religion , absolutely . </s>
If the—if what that means is , that it’s my identity , that people are on the ground attacking me— </s>
And this goes to show why Islam is dominated by radicals— </s>
It’s sort of— No . It’s a very… </s>
No , no . </s>
It’s just , it’s a— Sorry , dude , I got the last applause line . It’s a very superficial and unsophisticated view of religion to think that what we’re talking about here is if someone is offended by something about their religion— So the people— —then they’ll react with violence— </s>
—who died should yield to the fact that— When people act— —they’re unsophisticated— </s>
When people are acting— —in their knowledge that they died . When people are asked , would you resort to violence to defend your religion , I guarantee you that the people in Indonesia who answered that question , were not talking about being offended , they were talking about actually defending their lives and livelihood which by the way is a very real thing , when you see the war on terror being understood— It’s also very real in Indonesia— </s>
—not just in the Muslim world— </s>
—four islands to be directed— One last— </s>
—as an attack on Islam , this isn’t just Egyptians or Jordanians or Iraqis who think this . These are British non-Muslims who think this . Around the world , the majority view is that the war on Islam is a war against Muslim identity , it’s a— War on terror— </s>
It’s—I mean I’m sorry , the war on terror , is a war against Muslim identity , this is a— On that note— —very real issue . I think— </s>
So if I’m asked…are you—would you react if someone were to violate your beliefs , in defense of your beliefs— Yes . —then we’re not talking about being offended . </s>
But Reza , you were asked— That’s not what we’re talking about— —and you’ve answered the question . </s>
And we have one last question from a panelist for the other side from Richard Bulliet . Yeah , I’ll—I think we’ve gotten too serious , we’ll move on to some whimsy . So this is for Daveed . </s>
You finished your , your talk with , what struck me as an absolute absurdity , namely that the price of oil is somewhat equatable to the dominance of radical Islam . And it made me think , gee… if we can only solve our energy problem , will radical Islam go away ? Because , you’re making a remark— The only person who has ever really pursued this in print was Dan Pipes in his first book , saying that , radical Islam is purely a product of oil prices—I think it’s an absurdity . Well , it—well , okay , the way you frame it it is , but that’s not what I said . What I said , going off Edina’s remarks that Saudi Arabia is radical , is I talked about how the fact—how I used to work for a Saudi charity that did propagate radical material . </s>
So I’ve seen this firsthand , and can say that Saudi charity , Saudi institutions , Saudi imams , make a difference throughout the world . And the reason why they’re so widespread , is indeed because Saudi Arabia has a lot of money to spend , due to its oil revenues . The point I was making was simply that oil revenues aren’t going to dry up any time soon . Rather , the price of oil is skyrocketing . And as a result , these institutions are out there , far more than they were before . </s>
That goes to the point of hegemony . That goes to who has the power— Oh , that—but let’s— —who has the money , who’s installing the imams . And indeed— </s>
That goes to the point— — —of whether the Saudis are trying to export— — —their form of religion . </s>
And we’re perfectly willing to grant , the Saudis are trying to export it , but you haven’t demonstrated that the efforts the Saudis are making , are actually succeeding . </s>
All you’ve done is saying that they’re doing it— Okay , but we actually talked about that , Paul talked about that in the very first speech . Where he talked about the changes in Islam , in places like Indonesia , in the Balkans , in Somalia , look at Somalia . Where you have a war wracking the country , where the group formerly known as the Islamic Courts Union , now known as the Alliance for Reliberation of Somalia , managed to conquer the country , impose Islamic law in which people were arrested for watching Pretty in Pink , in which a karate instructor who had female students was arrested , where people were arrested for watching the World Cup . </s>
That stuff was unheard of in Somalia 30 years ago . And now—and today , that is the reality on the ground . So I can say for a fact , that yes , this oil money and this dawa , is making a difference , and it’s making a difference in the way that affects people’s lives . </s>
Okay . You’re probably wanting to get in on this conversation— And now you can join in this civil discourse on the question of whether Islam is dominated by radicals . We have microphones out in the audience , and if you’d like to raise your hand , the people bearing the microphones will find you . I’d like you to please not start to ask a question until we do have a microphone in front of you , and make your questions short and to the point . </s>
And if you are member of the press , please identify yourself as such . I’m a little bit blinded by the light , so I’m trying to see— Up in the left , yes , question— </s>
My name is James Taranto and I am a member of the press— Good— —I’m with The Wall Street Journal . I—this question is for any or all on the side for the motion . Has the—to what extent has—or on the whole let’s say , has , have the political changes in Iraq over the past five years strengthened or weakened the domination of Islam by radicals . </s>
In— This is Daveed Gartenstein-Ross , you want to answer that ? Okay , sure . </s>
I think that the changes in Iraq have had both effects . On the one hand , I think the Iraq war has clearly been a rallying point for radicals , and whether that’s justifiable or unjustifiable is something that people can decide on their own . </s>
But clearly , it’s been a great recruiting ground for Al Qaeda and others . The flip-side of that is that , we had some discussion before of the anti-jihadist movements that are there , things like the Sakwa movement . </s>
And those have had a cognizably good impact . I think on the whole , uh , the fighting there is something that is energizing of radicals in the Muslim world without a question . And that’s not going to stop regardless of the Sakwa movement . </s>
Where is our next question coming from , on the right . First of all I think this has been addressed on , pretty much one level , “Islam is dominated by radicals” has a multitude of meanings . </s>
Not just political , and I was very moved at what Miss Nomani said , talking about the—how women were treated in this religion . And , I don’t know obviously , I’m not an expert on the Muslim religion , but I do know several women in New York who go to mosques and are placed in separate areas who can not go out with a man or be seen with a man without a chaperone . And any union has to be…has to be validated by the head of the mosque . — </s>
Question— —I think , I think—and this , my question is to Edina . </s>
What do you think of the absolute bare-bones question of , as I say , microcosms grow into macrocosms , of bare-boned questions of human rights in that issue . Bare-bones questions of human rights , well… Okay . When it comes to the issue of women in mosques , what we see— I can speak again anecdotally and I can speak empirically , it’s a matter of what the audience would like to hear . When it comes to anecdotal things , you said something about the union of marriages , in any church the union of two people must be sanctified by that , by that religious institution . </s>
On the question of chaperones , there is , it in many ways , is a product of culture than of religion . There is what has been practiced by my family for generations is what is then being practiced . </s>
I think this question of religion and culture and the weaving of the two , is one of the central questions that we face within the global Muslim community today . </s>
And the reality is that Islam looks and feels and tastes different , no matter where you go . Regardless of who is in power , because of the question of culture and of identity that we are considering here . </s>
Is there a very real— Including on the subject— </s>
Yeah , is there a very real— —particularly about the women . Is there a very real problem , when it comes to the treatment of women in mosques and in human rights issues , absolutely . Is it the dominant force for Muslim women and their lives ? I would argue with that point . </s>
Because I , based again on my travels , on my experience , and on my interaction with the data that’s out there , there are just as many women who are , when they have an education , when they have access… And that’s , again , we have dividing lines , we can’t separate the question of human rights , when there is a lack of education , where there is poverty , where there are these surrounding issues , it is not simply a matter of , of , you know , of religious teachings . Because , there are , you have the Benazir Bhuttos . You have the women heads of state in Bangladesh and Pakistan and Indonesia and other places . You have Queen Noor of Jordan and Queen Rania , you have these other examples that exist out there , and they are just as much role models for Muslim women as are the problems that they are facing . These are both—these are two sides of the same reality , but absolutely , there’s a very real problem on the ground , and it’s one that is being faced by NGO’s , by civil society groups , and by women themselves on the ground . </s>
And that’s what I— that’s what I’m really trying to put the attention on here . Is that there is an active fight taking place on the ground . An active fight . </s>
And there has to be a fight because— There has to be a fight , I want to just make the point again— Asra Nomani— —there has to be a fight because the leadership is dominated by radicalism . And by patriarchy— </s>
In— yes , patriarchy is a form of radicalism if you ask me— As it is in other parts of the— Sure , but— —non-Muslim world— Right , but unfortunately , our society , our Muslim society is defined right now by a patriarchy that , the Christian and Jewish societies have evolved beyond . </s>
You’re confused— </s>
Oh , I’m sorry . I’m sorry , I didn’t just get censored in Dubai because I wanted to talk about women’s rights . Oh , I’m sorry , the mosque up the street didn’t tell me that I couldn’t pray in the main hall , because that’s not what a woman’s supposed to do . Oh , I’m sorry , those men that surrounded me— </s>
Orthodox synagogues— Excuse me— Reza— </s>
—orthodox synagogues are a portion— </s>
Catholic churches— </s>
Excuse me— —women can’t become priests— They’re a portion of— </s>
—they can’t serve , you know— </s>
They’re a portion of the Jewish community but the end of the day— Absolutely , patriarchy’s— —orthodox— —everywhere . —orthodox ideology is what defines our communities . </s>
Two out of three mosques in America do not even allow a woman on the board . That is a statistic— But , from where— —that is— </s>
Whose statistic is that , it’s very— That’s the Council— —easy to throw these things out there— —Council on American-Islamic Relations who are , consider themselves the NAACP of the Muslim world fighting for women’s rights . I mean this is the reality . </s>
We can talk politics , we can talk all sorts of , you know , dictatorships , ultimately , we’re dealing with bullies in the community who want to push their radical ideology— Asra Nomani , but it would be—one could infer from what you’ve said that , a hundred—at the start of the last century that all of Western civilization was dominated by extremists . </s>
And have we not gotten at least some movement where we have churches now , where we have women as priests . Where we have Catholic women who are— And they’re still fighting— —fighting for the right to— </s>
They are fighting— </s>
We have mosques where women are imams , so— Oh , really . </s>
Very small percentage— I’d love to go to them , in China , in some rural areas , oh , I’ll take a trip there but , I don’t think— Oh , no , in the United States— Oh , really , Reza , tell me where I could go— Absolutely , there’s a Zaytuna Institute , the only seminar— </s>

—trains as many women— Right— —imams as— </s>
Women imams to teach— —as it trains male imams— —the women . You know , because they’re acceptable for the sisters , but at the end of the day , they’re not good enough for the men— </s>
Another que— And that to me is unacceptable . Another question from the audience . </s>
Here , sir . I’d like to ask about Islam , from the standpoint of its own historical context , rather than from the prism of our absolute , individual standards or mixing the Muslim apple with the Christian orange if you will , which doesn’t take us very far . If we begin , say 950 years ago , when Islam was arguably the intellectual capitol of the world , since then there’s clearly been a trend of insularity and anti-intellectualism in the past thousand years , assuming that is true , what has been the trend in terms of tolerance , and radicalism , and in particular , not just the last thousand years but the last 100 and last 50 years . Dick Bulliett— You can handle that , Dick— </s>
I’d like to ask about that , it—you made a statement then you said , “assuming that to be true.” Well , that’s a big assumption . You’re talking about 950 years , you’re talking about roughly the year 1100 . </s>
Right ? </s>
Okay . It is a commonplace—the history of Western culture , that Europe was behind at one point , and then at a certain point Islam stagnated and became backward , whereas Europe leapt ahead , and created the modern world . Thanks to Islam , in large part . In large part , based on borrowings in one way or another from Islam . </s>
But the notion that Islam stagnated is contrary to historical fact in certain ways . In particular , over half of all the people in the world today who are Muslims , are the descendants of people who converted to Islam after this alleged period of stagnation . Islam’s greatest success , in terms of the growth of a faith community , was in the period when Europeans are claiming that , uh , that Islam was stagnant . What happened in that period , was that you had an enormous , and very complex , interaction of Islam with communities in all parts of the world… east Asia , southeast Asia , south Asia , Africa , Europe , Eastern Europe and so forth , and Islam became immensely richer and more complex , through this interaction . </s>
Now , some people say , well , Europe was open to all sorts of new ideas , but in fact Europe was open—was open to its own new ideas . There’s not a single major idea in European history that actually came from anywhere except Europe . Because Europe has been a kind of closed—or Euro-American society—been fairly closed to the conceptual life , the spiritual life , so forth of other parts of the world . </s>
Islam is remarkably open . And , so I think it’s a question of , if you say that all that counts , is who gets rich , and who wins wars , and who’s able to set up an imperialist system , then you have one argument . </s>
But if you’re talking about the notion of stagnation , Islam certainly did not stagnate in that period . This was a period of enormous growth and development of complexity and intercommunal cross-fertilization . We have time for another question from the audience , and , somewhere in the , somewhere in the back , I can’t see . Hello . </s>
Hi . </s>
So according to a 2007 Pew study , over 60 percent of Muslims in America identified as moderate , and I was hoping that— </s>
Identify as , excuse me ? </s>
Moderates . So I was hoping that Asra can elaborate a little bit on it , why again are…why is Islam dominated by radicals ? Because— </s>
Asra Nomani . Like I said before , I mean this is not a conversation about the majority of Muslims . We’re talking about whether Islam is dominated . Dominated to me means institutional Islam , it means the people who are running our mosques , the people who are running our—our organizations . </s>
It means , this establishment that it call Wahabism Incorporated , that is basically not just , you know , a pocket , an empty—an empty anecdote . It is an empire out there in the world that is defining our community . This isn’t a popularity contest about whether we want moderate expression of Islam or not . This is about who’s running our communities . And I can tell you that institutional Islam is representing a radical ideology that may not represent what most of Muslims believe , but at the end of the day , it’s not worth the trouble for most Muslims to battle them . </s>
I can tell you from the trenches , the struggle to battle that kind of institutional Islam is painful . You lose status , you get death threats , you get all sorts of abuse . And this is what happens whenever you challenge the authorities , and right now the authorities represent radical Islam . Closing statements from all six panelists now , two minutes each , and then we’ll have you vote on these arguments that you’ve heard , starting with a panelist against the motion , “Islam is dominated by extremists , ” Reza Aslan . </s>
I guess the question has to be once again , what exactly are these radicals dominating—Asra Nomani has said that they’re dominating action , that is demonstrably false , because that would mean that what we’re seeing in every country in the Muslim world is this radical , collective action , which of course takes part in political violence , in terrorism , which is simply not true . I mean that’s demonstrably false , that is not the majority of the actions that we’re seeing . </s>
Paul Marshall has said that it is the states that dis—Islam is , or radicals are dominating , that again is demonstrably false . Besides the fact that one third of the Muslim world lives in democracy , the—besides the fact that , of the most populous Muslim countries in the world , Turkey , Malaysia , Indonesia , Bangladesh , Lebanon , Senegal , these are all quite successful democratic states— One . —and that in those countries that we do see a real sort of movement of political , one could even say radical Islam , they’re all in response to secular autocracies in which the mosque is the only free space in society , and the only opposition is religious opposition . </s>
Daveed has said it’s the institutions that the Muslims are radical in , this again is demonstrably false , the Iman Declaration , 170 of the world’s leading clerics and scholars representing every single sect and schism of Islam came together , issued fatwas out—outlawing violence in the name of Islam , outlawing calling anyone a takfir or an apostate , the same thing happened in the Mecca Declaration a year after that , the same thing happened earlier in this year with the king of Jordan . So in every single one of these issues , the idea that something is being dominated is demonstrably false . So we can talk about our sort of visions of what Islam brings up , you know , the visions of warfare and them . But the— </s>
Thank you— —fact is when you think about it in its historical sense and its factual , objectifiable— Reza— —observafiable sense , it just doesn’t make any sense— </s>
Thank you , Reza Aslan , for your closing statement , Paul Marshall , arguing in favor of the motion . Okay , yes , we do argue it is a question of institutions , who is controlling organizations . Course one of those major and the most powerful of those organizations , is states . Though not just them . We’ve spoken not just about Saudi Arabia , we’ve spoken about Iran . </s>
Compared to the situation of 30 years ago , whereas a— with a radical Islamic regime you basically , just had the Saudis , at least a large one . Then you had Iran . Then you’ve had Sudan . </s>
Then you’ve had radicalization in Pakistan which has continued . You’ve had events in Somalia . </s>
You’ve had events in Nigeria . If you look at places where more radical movements are not per se the government , but are increasing influencing it , and are more powerful and have established themselves as the opposition , we see this in Egypt . </s>
We see this in Algeria . We see this in Malaysia . We see this in Indonesia . </s>
And in each of those countries we see an increase— One . —of violence . So in each of these settings , compare the situation 20 years ago , and the situation now . If you look at movements amongst Muslims , say amongst the Palestinians , amongst the Chechnyans , around Kashmir , in the Philippines , in Thailand , in Lebanon… You’ve had movements that are opposing the government . </s>
Usually it was in terms of national liberation or political freedom or access to resources . Now in each of those a shift towards a more radical Islamic emphasis . We see this across the board , in setting after setting . It is now more radical than it was then . </s>
Of course there’s a push-back , from Jordan . I’ve been involved in some of these conferences . Similarly with Turkey , similarly with Morocco , with Indonesian organizations . But they can not mask—so far , I hope they will—but so far they can not mask the power , the resources , which are arrayed against them . </s>
Currently , in the war of ideas— Thank you— —within the Muslim world , the radicals are winning . Paul Marshall . And now , a closing statement from Edina Lekovic . </s>
In the war of ideas , the moderates are the ones who have regained the ground since 9-11 , both in internationally recognized leaders , and in the feelings and the sentiments of the people on the ground . And it is those people on the ground , 1.3 billion of them , who dominate and define the religion of Islam . As do the recognized religious leaders who are , as we mentioned , time and again , pushing for a new form of tolerance , and more and greater dialogue with other religious institutions as well as state powers . Let us not confuse Islamic states , for—and misunderstand them as anything other than the two-thirds of them that are dictatorships . The argument on the table is not whether the Muslim world is ruled by dictatorships . </s>
It most certainly is . But that is not the question on the table , the question is whether Islam itself , and therefore , the global population of Muslims , are dominated— One— </s>
—by radicals . </s>
Radicals are failing in their attempt to dominate . </s>
The moral bankruptcy of the militants as well as their abject failure in socioeconomic terms has strengthened the leaders of moderate , predominantly Muslim nations , just like Turkey , like Indonesia , like Malaysia , in their struggle against religious radicalism and backwardness . </s>
Let us remember again the people on the ground who make up the dominant force within Islam , and who have wrestled back control over their faith and are continuing to do so . Are they the absolute , at—the 100 percent at this point , absolutely not . </s>
But they make up the dominant side and they say , according to Gallup , that the most important thing that Westerners can do to improve relations with their societies , is to change their negative views toward Islam , and respect Muslims and Islam . </s>
Thank you , Edina Lekovic , for that closing statement against the motion , now with a closing statement for the motion , “Islam is dominated by radicals , ” is Asra Nomani . </s>
“Regain the ground , ” “wrestled back our communities , ” I don’t think so . A Christian or Jew can not go into Mecca , because you’re banned . </s>
A woman can not travel in…to Mecca , because of the laws of the land that say that she has to have a chaperone . The men in our community have decided that in fact their radical version of the ideology allows them to , to retain power . You can call it an autocracy , you can call it dictatorships , you can call it anything you want , but it is radical and it is dominating our communities . Just look at the example of the South , in the 1930s let’s say . </s>
Civil rights… Let’s exchange the words of our proposition . The South was dominated by white supremists at that time . Would they have been the majority ? Maybe not . </s>
But they controlled the churches , they controlled the cops , they controlled the laws , they controlled the power structure . One— </s>
That’s what we’re talking about . </s>
Our laws , our power structure , our cops , our clerics , are all on the payroll of an ideology that is radical . And it’s an issue of great pain to me as a Muslim , it’s an issue of great sadness . It breaks my heart that this is the reality and the truth , and it’s an ugly truth . But , I challenge you , to accept it , because even though it’s ugly , it’s only when we’re honest about it that we’re actually gon na be able to change the world so that this reality , where Muslims regain the ground and take back our communities , will actually happen one day . </s>
It hasn’t happened yet . And , I can only hope that it will happen . But right now , we are not , we have not won the war , and the struggle continues , and I assure you that we are in the struggle . Asra— </s>
Thank you . </s>
—Nomani , thank you . And now Richard Bulliett , your closing statement . I have some problem squaring what Asra has just said , with what Paul Marshall started with . He started by saying , that…Islam is okay , most Muslims are okay . </s>
Like , nothing against Islam , nothing against most Muslims . But that , the people who are dominating are those who are striving for a political order that represents a reactionary version of Islam . Now we get to Asra , who just says that it’s true there are these dictatorships , these are totalitarian states , these are the autocracies , and autocracy is radical . </s>
And therefore radicals dominate Islam , well , but that radical…you know , that isn’t the radical that Paul’s talking about . There is nothing in the government of Syria or the government of Egypt or the government of most of the other autocracies in the Muslim world , that is in favor of striving for a political order that represents a reactionary version of Islam . In fact , most of these governments are— </s>
One . —dead opposed , to this sort of version of Islam . They’re trying to have what they call secular nationalist states , you can talk about the Baath party in Syria , you can talk about the Tunisians , you can talk about virtually every country except Saudi Arabia and Iran . But , you can’t get away with the idea of saying that , radicals dominate Islam because all—all autocrats are radical . </s>
That may be true . But that’s very different from saying that , what’s dominating Islam , which is the proposition of your team , is a particular version of Islam . We can agree , that autocracy is the besetting problem of Islam in that many of the reactions that you have , come as reactions to autocracy , and , just one word on the women . </s>
Every Muslim political group I know that is striving to find elections in the Muslim world , believes that all women should have the vote equally to men . Richard Bulliett , thank you very much for your closing statement and now , the last of the closing statements , from a supporter of the motion , “Islam is dominated by radicals , ” Daveed Gartenstein- Ross . In this debate we’ve defined hegemony in two ways . </s>
We have defined it as being hegemony over institutions , and hegemony over states . Now , Richard Bulliett in his last speech finds a contradiction , in that he says that the autocratic governments aren’t actually Islamic . Now , here’s a statistic that Asra put forward previously in the Q & A , which is important . About one billion of the world’s Muslims live in Muslim-majority countries . </s>
There are 22 countries , in which Islam is declared the state religion . </s>
A look at the numbers shows that about 602 million Muslims—that’s 58 percent of those living in predominantly Muslim countries—live in places where Islam is the state religion . So , the autocracies are indeed enforcing Islam . That’s one thing that they’re doing . But it’s not just the autocracies . </s>
It’s the institutions . The institutions are important as well . </s>
And their argument , as Bulliett expressed in his last opening speech , is that for all the reasons given to you by the other side , vote against the motion , it comes down to a question of what hegemony means . And the only person on this side who tried to defend—to define hegemony , is Richard Bulliett . One— </s>
Who said hegemony requires a majority . Well , by that logic , everyone on that side has talked about how the US is a hegemon . Does that mean that the majority of people in the world are then Americans ? </s>
Of course not . </s>
The fact is here , that if you look at where power is , power is in the hands of those who are trying to enforce a particularistic view of Islam . Look at the institutions , look at the anti-apostasy laws . Look at anti-blasphemy laws . Look at the prohibition on evangelism . Look at prohibitions on free speech . </s>
This is not a pretty situation . And it’s important to recognize where the power lies . That’s what we’re asking you to do . We’re asking you to vote for the resolution , to identify the challenges that all of us , all debaters acknowledge , lay ahead . </s>
And that’s why I would like you to vote for this resolution . Thank you . And thank you , Daveed Gartenstein-Ross for your closing statement , and thanks to all of you , it’s now time for you to decide who carried the day . Once again , please pick up the keypad that is attached to the left armrest of your seat . Wait for my prompt . </s>

Please cast your vote now . We’re waiting for the bytes and the bits to tally up , and I just want to—we’ll wait for the results in a moment , I want to thank the debaters first of all , and also the audience for your good work .

The final Intelligence Squared US debate of the season , will be on Tuesday , March 13th , here at Asia Society and Museum— WOMAN May 13th— </s>
Tuesday , May 13th excuse me . We don’t use that on the broadcast , do we , so I don’t have to repeat that . It’ll be on Tuesday , May 13th , here at Asia Society and Museum , and the motion to be debated is , “We Should Legalize the Market for Human Organs.” But they’ll— WOMAN Can we come back to that— —there’ll be no organs actually legalized during the— That’ll be moderated by the way by my colleague , NPR’s Michele Norris , and the panelists for the next debate are , for the motion , professor of law at George Mason University Lloyd Cohen ; the director of transplantation and professor of surgery at SUNY Upstate Medical University , Amy Friedman ; and resident scholar at American Enterprise Institute , Sally Satel . </s>
And against the motion the panel will be , the team will be , James Childress , professor of ethics at the University of Virginia and director of the Institute for Practical Ethics and Public Life ; professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School and Director of Medical Affairs of the Transplantation Society , Frances Delmonico— Excuse me . And David Rothman , a professor of social medicine . </s>
I have the results but I can’t read it because I’ve lost my voice . And also— historian David , Rothman , of Columbia University . </s>
So… Here are the results . </s>
First I—before I tell you the results— An edited version of tonight’s Intelligence Squared US debate will be heard locally , on WNYC , a wonderful NPR member station , AM 820 , on Sunday , April 27th at 8 p.m . Those debates are heard on more than 150 NPR stations across the country , please check your NPR member station listings for the debates and times of broadcasts out of New York City . After the debate , 73 percent of you said you agreed with the motion , that Islam is dominated by radicals . </s>
23 percent were against , and 4 percent remain undecided . </s>
So congratulations to the team for… UA big swing . Copies of books by the way by our panelists are on sale upstairs in the lobby , and you can also purchase DVD’s from previous debates here tonight . Thank you very much . And now I would like to introduce the Chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S. , who makes all of this possible , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Welcome , and thank you all for coming . My task in these evenings is to frame the debate . And in this particular case I want to start by quoting George W. Bush often proclaimed that “Islam is a religion of peace” and it is one of the few things with which President Obama agrees . It is doubtless true that the vast majority of Muslims around the world live peacefully , and do not condone violent acts . Their secular concerns are dominant—making a living , raising families , educating their children . </s>
Their religion provides spiritual comfort , and a source of meaning , even transcendence , to their lives . </s>
On the other hand , just today the New York Times reported that Faisal Shahzad , the Times Square bomber , said in court prior to sentencing “Brace yourselves , because the war with Muslims has just begun.” Certainly in the past decades the vast majority of terrorist activity has been undertaken in the name of Islam . In some respects , Islamism resembles the totalitarian movements of the first half of the twentieth century : the ruthless use of violence in pursuit of ideology and power by Hitler , Stalin and Mao . </s>
Just as most of their victims were their own people , most victims of Islamist terror have been Muslims . History is replete with examples of violent minorities who have held sway over peace loving majorities . Perhaps the relevant question for this evening is what the majority of Muslims believe . </s>
But perhaps it is whether Islam , viewed as an ideological force , is in direct opposition to western interests and western values . </s>
Should we respect Islam as a religion of peace , or should we accept Samuel Huntington’s view that we are engaged in a clash of civilizations ? </s>
Or might this be a false dichotomy ? </s>
Can we honor our own traditions of pluralism and free exercise of religion , and accept that for the vast majority of Muslims it is indeed a religion of peace , without compromising our ability to defend ourselves and our values against the ruthless few that wish us harm ? Well , these are subtle and complex questions , and we 've assembled an extraordinary panel of experts this evening to explore them . </s>
It 's now my privilege to turn the evening over to our moderator , John Donvan , but before I do so I 'd like to invite a round of applause to congratulate him on his third Emmy Award . </s>
Thank you , and I was going to ask for another round for Robert Rosenkranz , and there it is . Welcome everyone , to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I’m John Donvan of ABC News , and once again it is my honor to act as moderator as the four debaters you see sharing this stage with me here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University -- four debaters , two against two , will be debating this motion : “Islam is a religion of peace.” </s>
Now , this is a debate . There will be winners and losers , and you , our audience , will be acting as the judges . By the time this debate has ended you will have been asked to vote twice , once before and once again after the debate , on where you stand on this motion , and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . </s>
So , let’s go to the preliminary vote . If you go to the keypads on your seat , our motion is “Islam is a religion of peace.” If you are for the motion , press number one . </s>
If you are against the motion , press number two . If you are undecided , press number three . You can correct any mistake just by repressing , and ignore the other numbers . And we will present the results of both votes for you at the end of the evening , and that’s how we will know who our winner is . </s>
So , opening round -- sorry , let me put it this way : round one is opening statements by each side , seven minutes in turn , and I would like to begin by introducing our first speaker for the motion “Islam is a religion of peace.” I’d like to introduce Zeba Khan , the only American on our panel and quite possibly the youngest debater ever to take part in an Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
Welcome , Zeba . I know that I first became aware of you when the Washington Post was running a reality game show to name America’s next pundit . They had 1,400 entrants , and what place did you come in ? They had 4,800 entrants , actually . </s>
4,800 . And you came in… ? I came in second . Second . Well , look where you are now . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Zeba Khan . </s>
Thank you . I want to express my deepest gratitude to Mr. Rosenkranz and the Intelligence Squared forum for allowing me to speak tonight alongside such well-known and far more distinguished co-panelists . </s>
This is particularly an honor for me because , let’s be honest , I haven’t written a book , I’m not a regular on national T.V . or radio . What I have is my story . I am a Muslim American woman born and raised in Toledo , Ohio by two very loving Indian Muslim parents . </s>
My sister , brother , and I were raised in a middle-class American home . </s>
We went to Mosque on Sundays , attended Sunday school classes , and prayed the community prayer with our community of Pakistanis , Lebanese , and Syrian Muslims . When I was in high school , our Mosque president was a woman , who did not wear a headscarf . And it may come as a surprise to some of you , but for the entirety of my life men and women have prayed side by side at our Mosque , and both can enter the prayer hall using the same door . My parents are both very religious people , but they express their faith in different ways . </s>
My father emphasizes the devotional , and he tends to spend his time praying and reciting the Koran , whereas my mother emphasized the more constructive approach . She uses community service and volunteering to express hers . But what they both share is fundamental Islamic principles . First and foremost , seek knowledge . </s>
They urged their children , all three of us , to question , to have critical minds , and to doubt . They wanted us to engage fully with our faith and to question everything . They lived out the Koranic commandments that there is no compulsion in religion , and also that God said , in the Koran , “I made you into many tribes so that you might know one another.” And as such , they enrolled me and my siblings in a Hebrew day school for nine years , where we learned Hebrew , read the Torah , and prayed in a synagogue almost every morning . They always wanted us to learn about other faiths , and they always made sure that we knew the difference , though , between Islam and Judaism . </s>
But they also made sure we also respected our Jewish sisters and brothers in faith . </s>
My story is just one of 1.5 billion stories in some 57 countries . The Muslim population is one of the most diverse and eclectic in the world . We are Sunnis , we are Shias , and even in the Shia tradition there are Zaidis , Ismailis , Ismasheries . There are numerous madhhabs , or schools of thought , and Sufi mystic orders . Like Christians and Jews , Muslims can be observant , nonobservant , performist , humanist , secularist , extremist , mainstream , and there are even some Muslims who consider themselves culturally Muslims but are actually atheists . </s>
Now , the motion before you tonight is asking you to determine whether Islam is a religion of peace . And at first blush , that might seem a bit tricky to decide . After all , the Koran and the Hadith have verses in them that point to peace and justice and love . </s>
But there are other verses that are violent , are about violence and about violence against specific people . So how then do we reconcile these seemingly contradictory verses ? How then do we decide whether Islam is a religion of peace ? </s>
The only way to answer that question is to take an honest look at the people who practice the faith and how they interpret it . According to Gallup 's ground breaking study on what a billion Muslims think , 93 percent of Muslims around the world are peaceful , mainstream Muslims . Seven percent are what Gallup determines as politically radicalized . And within that seven percent , there 's a smaller percent that has succumbed to the use of violence . Any percent is too much . </s>
But we must remember that the violent minority of a minority are motivated by politics , not religion . As Gallup concluded , what distinguishes the politically radicalized Muslims from the mainstream Muslims is their politics , not their piety . </s>
Robert Pape , a University of Chicago political scientist , further confirmed this in his book , Dying to Win , in which he came to the same conclusion , that the actions of terrorists are politically motivated , not through religion . The Tamil Tigers , for example , which are predominantly a Hindu group , used and pioneered the use of suicide bombing , did so far secessionist reasons , not for religious goals . </s>
Our opponents would have you believe that there is a take all , no winner clash between Islam and the West , and that Muslims who try to balance their Western values and Islam arrive at a state of cognitive dissonance and are left either mute or crazy by this internal struggle . That distribution description does n't resonate for me or for my family or for my friends or for my community , because those two aspects of our identity were never in conflict with each other and were never introduced to us as in conflict with each other . </s>
I did n't realize that there were people out there who wondered whether people -- Muslims like me existed or could exist until after 9/11 . Let me be clear . There are some horrifically violent criminals out there who twist our faith to justify their hate and their violence . </s>
But I am here to tell you they do n't speak for Islam . Mohammad Hamdani , a first responder who died on 9/11 , speaks for Islam . Hassan Askari , a Brooklyn Muslim who stepped in on the subway and saved a complete stranger who was being physically attacked because he was Jewish , he speaks for Islam . Zainab Salbi , through her organization Women for Women International , has assisted forever a quarter of a million women across the world . </s>
She speaks for Islam . </s>
And the entire Muslim community of India , who , when the authorities asked them to take the militants who attacked Mumbai in 2008 , said resoundingly and collectively no . We will not let the terrorists be buried with us . The media and those who profit from the narrative of Islam versus the West are never going to tell you my story or the stories of these Muslims who constitute the vast majority of Muslims around the world . But just because you may not hear us , it does n't mean we 're not speaking out . And just because you may not see us on TV , it does n't mean we do n't exist . </s>
If you vote against the motion , I would argue you 're voting against the moderate voices of mainstream Islam and telling the terrorists that you agree with their version . I urge to you vote for the motion . Thank you . Thank you , Zeba Khan . </s>
Our motion is , “Islam is a religion of peace.” You have heard the opening statement in support of this motion . Now to speak first against the motion that Islam is a religion of peace , I 'd like to introduce Ayaan Hirsi Ali , a very , very well-known dissident , born in Somalia , fled to the Netherlands , where she was a member of the parliament , the Dutch parliament . Now she is in the United States , once again on a case of asylum because -- Ayaan ? </s>
Well , because I had to live with -- basically , I was afraid for my life . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen . In the 21st Century , in a free country . Ladies and gentlemen , Ayaan Hirsi Ali . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , I am surprised by the motion itself . When I first heard it , it reminded me of the academic question , how many angels can dance on the head of a pin ? </s>
And I think , well , if you do the salsa or the cha cha , not many . Why are we not having a motion on is Christianity a religion of peace , is Judaism a religion of peace , et cetera ? </s>
Because those would be academic motions . Unfortunately , the motion , “Islam is a religion of peace” is not academic . I respect and admire Zeba Khan . And I want to acknowledge the fact that you indeed are a demonstration of the assimilation of a Muslim individual , a Muslim woman into Western society , into an American society . </s>
But you come from a middle class family that was very eclectic and respected pluralism . I respect that very much , and I admire you for it . And I think you are an example to others . However , I disagree with you that you represent Islam or that you speak for Islam . </s>
The problem that is inherent in Islam from the time of its foundation up to this moment is who speaks for Islam . And I’ll get to that later on . Is it Zeba Khan or is it Faisal Shahzad ? </s>
He was also a middle class man , went to business school , married an American woman , had two children , lived just like you , like many of you . And yet , he made a different choice based on a combination of piety and politics . And that 's what Islam is . And before I go on , let me define the key terms of the motion . </s>
First , religion . The most common definition of religion you will find is the universal quest of humans in search -- in search of the sacred or the holy . That search is expressed intellectually . It 's expressed in practice . It is expressed in fellowship . </s>
And you look at the religion like Islam , on an intellectual level it was expressed by the founder of Islam as a demolition of all other gods . </s>
Polytheism had to end , and all humanity had to be united under one God . From those of you who are familiar with history , and I think a crowd like this is , you know that no monotheistic religion can be a religion of peace . No monotheistic religion is a religion of peace , and definitely not Islam . Monotheistic religions know periods , lengthy periods of peace , but they also know lengthy periods of war . </s>
In times of practice , yes , in Islam , you practice charity , you go to Hajj , you pray , all of that . But in terms of practice , there is also the expression , there is the concept of jihad . </s>
And I find it a pity that Zeba Khan did not mention that concept , which is central to Islam 's conquests and Islam 's success . </s>
The founder of Islam , Mohammad , in his lifetime , conducted 65 campaigns of war that were all successful . </s>
And that militaristic history of Islam is well documented . Just go Google it . And if you do n't find it on Google , go to all those former empires that were conquered . The combination of a history of empire , of conquest , also leaves a legacy behind . </s>
And that legacy is the thrusting together of people of different ethnicities , languages , et cetera . So even if that empire declines , the likelihood , the likelihood of conflict , of war , is probable . It 's high , especially where there is a fault line . </s>
That 's where Samuel Huntington had a point . That history of militarism , combined with the legacy of empire , those two points alone belie the motion tonight , that Islam is a religion of peace , but that 's not all . When empires decline , those who are defeated , and the Muslim Empire declined , those who are defeated sometimes themselves in a state of victimhood . That state of victimhood is exploited by the leadership or the self-appointed leaders of Islam . And what do you see ? </s>
You see a number of people , and I concede it 's a minority , who believe that Islam is under siege . A mentality of victimhood tells those who are conquered , who are vanquished , that the problem was caused by external powers , not by us , and that systematic denial within Islam after the 19th Century to blame only outsiders exempts Islam from blame , from the explanation what went wrong . Yes , it was external , yes , Muslims were humiliated , yes , they were conquered , yes , they were colonized , but how much was also because of the flaws of Islam ? And that takes me to the point of absolutism . </s>
When the West went into its scientific revolution , why was n't it Muslims ? Muslims were the first scientists , arithmetic , logic , et cetera . </s>
They were great ; why did n't they get into that scientific revolution ? Why were they left behind ? Was it only because of external factors or were there internal flaws ? That combination of a status of victimhood and the absolutism -- the demand that you can never revise or reflect on the Koran , that you can never , never ever refute what Mohammad said , you can only follow his example -- that absolutism combined with that status of victimhood also enlarges the likelihood of conflict , and those two combined like the other two factors like -- </s>
All right , your time is up . Thank you . That belies the motion . I 'll keep my last two factors for the time I have remaining , thank you . Thank you . </s>
We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan . We have four debaters , two teams of two , fighting it out over this motion , `` Islam is a religion of peace . '' </s>
You have heard from the first two debaters in their opening statements , and now on to the third . </s>
I 'd like to introduce Maajid Nawaz , who is director of the Quilliam Foundation , and he has an amazing biography , and several years back , would have been America 's nightmare . He was a radical , he was imprisoned in Egypt while on a trip there , though he 's born in the U.K. , was in Egypt and tortured for being a radical , and something happened to you in prison , 180-degree turn -- in one sentence , what was it ? In one sentence . Yeah . You 're talking about four years now . </s>
Yeah . Amnesty International . Well , I 'll explain that and hopefully . Fair enough . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Maajid Nawaz . Thank you . Can I indulge the audience and just ask for a round of applause for Zeba 's mom , she 's just over there , I think she did a wonderful job . To raise your daughter to speak Hebrew in the current climate is amazing and I applaud you . So , ladies and gentlemen , thank you for giving me this opportunity . </s>
I want to begin by just stating what this debate is not about . This debate is not about making excuses for terrorism . </s>
Basically my career is to challenge extremism and terrorism in the West and also in Muslim majority countries . I 've just flown right in from Pakistan where I 've been building the foundations for the first nationwide social movement to challenge extremism and promote democratic values in Pakistan . And I 'm proud to announce that just today we gained our 10,000th member on Facebook . </s>
So this debate -- -- this debate is not about making excuses for suicide bombers even inside Israel . We make no apologies and no excuses on this panel for terrorism , for extremism , and for people who kill innocent civilians , including inside Israel . This debate acknowledges , we , on our panel , Zeba and myself , acknowledge that Muslims do need to speak out against extremism and to challenge it , and more Muslims need to do that more actively . We acknowledge that Muslims bear responsibility in reclaiming their faith from those -- the minority who have hijacked Islam and who have captured the public imagination in their definition of Islam . </s>
We acknowledge that , and I am in my own person a manifestation of that effort , as is Zeba in the way she was raised . So we acknowledge that as well . This debate , in fact , is an appeal . </s>
It’s not -- also , before I move to the fact that it’s an appeal , it’s also not a threat . </s>
So , we’re not going to argue here tonight that if you don’t vote for the motion , that somehow Muslims are going to rise up and attack you for insulting Islam . That’s not the case . This is an appeal . And it’s an appeal to your good sense and your good character and to what you know inside you . </s>
This is not a debate for Islam at all . </s>
This is a debate for peace . And we are not arguing for Islamic peace ; we’re arguing for Islam to be -- with all other religions and beliefs and those that have no faith -- to be part of the effort to create peace in the world . </s>
So this is a debate for peace . It’s a debate , and I’m asking you all to vote tonight not for Islam , but to vote for peace and to help contribute the efforts of all of us around the world who are working for peace . Because there are people like me who spent 13 years of our lives working to create hatred . I used to believe that Islam is not a religion of peace . </s>
In fact , I used to believe that Islam mandates war . I used to believe and propagate across the world in more than three countries that Islam mandates war and mandates the creation of a state that will have at its heart of its foreign policy a policy to create conquest . I called it jihad . I believed that Islam was not a religion of peace because I adopted an ideology at 16 years old and stuck with that until my imprisonment and after I was released from prison when I was 28 years old . </s>
By that time I had established this ideology in Pakistan and in Denmark and contributed to its growth in Egypt . </s>
But I learned in prison two things . One was what I’m appealing to you today and that was when people hold out an olive branch , it does work . People I’d considered my enemy , people I’d considered the enemy of my people , Amnesty International with their advocation of human rights that I believed was a tool to colonize the minds of Muslims , adopted me as a prisoner of conscience . </s>
And by handing me that olive branch , I recognized that there was goodness in the world and there were people who , regardless of the provocation they find in the world today , are still willing to fight for peace and are still willing to redefine the debate . And that’s what I’m asking you to do here tonight . Because by redefining the debate , and by insisting that they would not allow my hatred to define for them the way in which they viewed me , they changed my heart . </s>
I went on and took that message forward and helped establish the world’s first counter-extremism think tank in the West , then went into Pakistan to establish the first nationwide counter-extremism movement in Pakistan . </s>
And as I said , we had 10,000 supporters before we’d even launched , of Muslims in Pakistan who are helping us to redefine the debate , who are not allowing the minority of extremists to hijack Islam , to monopolize its definition , and then define for us all that this should be a world of war , not just Islam as a religion of war , but as you heard from our co-panelists on the other side , all religions should be religions of war in their minds . Whether that’s because they want to fight or because they don’t believe in religions and they wish to challenge religions from that basis . And so I make an appeal to all of you tonight to help us redefine this debate . And the second thing that happened to me in prison that helped me change my mind was that I had the opportunity -- I won’t say good fortune because it wasn’t really that -- but the opportunity to mix with some of the leading founding jihadists of the world inside an Egyptian prison , ironically built by the British . And what I learned was that I had been extremely arrogant . </s>
I had suffered from the failure that I saw here tonight in my respected colleagues’ presentation . I had failed to contextualize history , and when I was this young and angry 24-year-old who , yes , had grievances , who’d been stabbed at multiple times growing up on the streets of Essex , who had been falsely arrested on a number of occasions because of racial profiling -- I was a very angry young man . </s>
But I went to men in prison , who had been in prison since I was three years old , and then I met them at 24 , and they had abandoned their previous terrorist ideologies and I had the arrogance to try and convince them that they had sold out , that they didn’t understand that true Islam was a religion of war . And they said to me , “Young lad , come and sit down . </s>
We’ll tell you a story or two.” </s>
And over the course of the four years , after having learned Arabic , after having memorized half of the Koran , after having studied the theology , though myself not being too much of a religious man , I came to the conclusion that Islam had been hijacked and abused and politicized by something that I now refer to as Islamism , the modern ideology that owes more to post World War I European fascism than it does to the traditions of Islam . And these former jihadists , among them the assassins of Egypt 's former president , Anwar Sadat , who was killed in 1981 , they had come to the same conclusions . And so I appeal to all of you as my time runs out -- there is much more to say -- to vote to help us all to redefine this motion , to redefine this world , because only by refusing to accept the paradigms that we find imposed upon us can we refute change . </s>
And that 's exactly how the civil rights movement in America tackled this issue when they were faced with such situations in the past . Thank you for your patience , and thank you for your time . Our motion is , “Islam is a religion of peace.” </s>
And now to speak against the motion , Douglas Murray . He is a best selling author and founder and director of the Center for Social Cohesion , also a citizen of the United Kingdom , a member of the Church of England until recently . You said that your study of the Koran -- you said this in print -- made you an atheist . That 's right . I said Mohammad made me an atheist . </s>
The publisher said at the time that it 's a pretty provocative headline . I said , “Well , get somebody to do the next one.” </s>
She said , “I could find a Catholic who could say Mohammad made me a Catholic.” I said , “How about trying to make a three-part article and get a third one of somebody saying Mohammad made me a Jew.” And that one would be the trouble . Douglas Murray , ladies and gentlemen . Well , thank you . </s>
Thank you . </s>
It 's a great pleasure to be here tonight . I 'm sorry to make this panel rather Brit-centric after my colleague Maajid . It is n't an attempt by us to have a British takeover of the old colony or anything like that . But I was coming earlier from my own fallen empire , going back to my friend and colleague Ayaan 's comments earlier . And I was reading the paper , as I 'm sure all of you were doing all yesterday . </s>
Maajid finished his comments by talking about the importance of changing paradigms . I 'm not sure it is about paradigms . I think it 's about facts . </s>
Here are some facts . In my newspaper earlier , the Times Square Bomber , of course , a man just up the road from here , who tried to kill thousands of people , only , by the way , did n't manage it because he set the 24-hour timing device at 7:00 a.m . instead of 7:00 p.m. , 1900 hours was what it was meant to be . </s>
If he had to have got that bit right , thousands of New Yorkers would have died earlier this year , again . I see further in the paper 12 suspects arrested in France in a network trying to recruit people to go in to fight American and other troops in Afghanistan . </s>
I turn to another page of the newspaper , in the city I had just flown off from this morning , a Muslim London Underground worker who was -- had written to his wife who was off to - - tried to become a martyr for Allah , as he said . He said , “More than anything I wish Allah to grant me martyrdom . '' </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , we have to look at facts . We should also , just quickly -- if I may refer something to the wording of tonight 's debate , Ayaan 's already mentioned it . But let me put it this way . </s>
You 're , I 'm sure , a liberal minded New York audience . At least I hope you are . </s>
We will see . </s>
But I imagine that if the motion we had here tonight was “Christianity is a religion of peace , ” we get to the Q and A , perhaps even before , and somebody would say if the other side were arguing for that , somebody would say , `` What about the crusades , hmm ? What about that ? '' Then there 'd be some other Clever Clarks who 'd say , “I -- what about that Florida pastor the other week ? There was a nasty business . </s>
That 's Christianity for you.” If we 'd have had tonight Judaism is a religion of peace , the other side would try to argue that . Sure as anything , there 'd be people popping up in the hall tonight saying , “Oh , there 's this bit in one of the Old Testament books , really , really bad , all sorts of massacres going on . Why do n't you talk about that ? ” </s>
There might even be people trying to say that religion -- the argument that Judaism was a religion of peace could n't be argued because people would say look at what Israel is doing . And is n't that a direct , and so on . </s>
So let 's not have a debate about Islam and whether or not Islam is a religion of peace without talking about the facts to do with Islam . It 's an absurd situation we 're in , where nothing that anyone does whilst being Muslim is any responsibility of Islam . Yet anything anyone does whilst being a Christian or a Jew is the responsibility of all Christians , all Jews . Let 's make this as straightforward as I can . Take the categorization that eminent scholars like Bernard Lewis and Ibn Warraq have made . </s>
Let 's say Islam is a very , very complex thing . And the best way I can do this in the very short time I have , is say you have three Islams , Islam one , two , and three . </s>
Islam one , the Koran and the life of Mohammad and the Hadith . </s>
Islam two , the tradition of the Sharia . Islam three , what Muslims do now . The first of those things , Islam , the Koran and so on , is bad . It is bad . </s>
There is a lot of violence in it . </s>
And what 's worse , the peaceful verses are superseded by the violent verses . The violent verses also sadly are more numerous in number . Then you 've got the life of Mohammad . Again , a bad man , a very bad man . It happens to be that not a great role model if you look at it . </s>
Takes child brides , abuses a small girl , multiple wives , himself a warrior , himself a war criminal , himself beheads Jews . This , I would have thought , would be a signal of not great peacefulness . Then you 've got the tradition of the Sharia , again , not great peacefulness , still no schools of Sharia that people in this hall would want to submit to . And thirdly , what Muslims do now . Thankfully , there is some hope in that one , because most Muslims , thank goodness -- I almost said thank God , but -- old habits die-hard . </s>
Most Muslims do n't do what those texts say because they exercise their judgment as moral beings without having to refer to defunct holy books . </s>
Now , look , I wish that Zeba and Maajid were the spokespeople of Islam . It would be lovely . Although in Maajid 's case , it would have taken rather too long if everyone had to go 14 years of preaching the downfall of America and then said no , not so much . But we are where we are . Anyhow , I wish they spoke for Islam . </s>
It would be great . </s>
But the fact is that tonight , the organizers of this debate asked a number of clerics , none of them which showed , specifically they would n't show and debate against Ayaan Hirsi Ali . Myself , I do n't think they cared . </s>
But no , it 's very interesting . </s>
They will not debate . Time and again , Muslims -- the actual leaders of your religion will not debate this . </s>
And you are left with people -- now here , the reasons why of course is the leaders of the religion show such terrible -- terrible lessons . It is not a small thing . It 's not as if it were a detail . </s>
It 's not like a wacky Florida pastor . But you 've got the largest Sunni state of Saudi Arabia , the most important Sunni state in the world , the most extraordinary closed prison of a society . It 's not a detail . </s>
It 's not a one-off nut job . </s>
The Shiite republic of Iran is what it is , led by the people it 's led by . That is not an accident . It 's not a detail . The thing that worries me is that although tonight we hear from the panelists here about how Islam is a religion of peace , the fact is that the people who are making the decisions in the religion , the people who are preaching the religion , the heads of that religion , people like Sheikh Qaradawi who broadcasts anti-Semitic -- the most appalling filth every week on the main network , that is the faith that is speaking for you guys . </s>
I wish that Zeba , you were on every week on Al Jazeera , but you are not . </s>
Qaradawi is . The problem is that Islam is an unstable component , as a religion , an unstable component . </s>
A thousand years ago , the Mustabalites tried to reform the religion . </s>
They were wiped out . The fact is that Islam is many things , many , many things . </s>
But to say it 's a religion of peace is nonsense . It 's to ignore reality . </s>
It 's to ignore very difficult but necessary facts , not paradigms , but facts . To say that Islam is a religion of peace is to say something based entirely on hope . It 's to elevate a hope into truth . </s>
And I hope , as you will note , history teaches us that 's a very bad thing to do . Thank you . Thank you , Douglas Murray . </s>
And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
We have heard opening statements . We 're going to move into round two . Remember how you voted in the beginning . </s>
We 're going to move into round two , in which the debaters address one another directly . They will be taking questions from me and then questions from you in the audience . So , I just want to state where we are . This is an Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I am John Donvan of ABC News . We have two teams of debaters arguing out this motion : “Islam is a religion of peace.” The side arguing for the motion , Zeba Khan and Maajid Nawaz , have been arguing -- make the argument that the extremists do not define Islam . Take away the extremists , and you have a religion of peace . </s>
The side arguing against , Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Douglas Murray , argue it 's not about extremists . It 's inherent . It 's inherent in the tradition . </s>
It 's inherent in the scripture , and it 's inherent in the history . And so the question of the notion , Ayaan Hirsi Ali , of this not just being about extremists , you can see that there are extremists , but that 's , you say , not the problem , what about your opponents , what about your parents , what about Muslims you know who do not adhere to a violent form of religion , are they -- if there 's something about the faith themselves , are they embracing spiritually something that is morally an illusion ? Well , my parents and people like my respectful opponents here are ignoring the basic tenets of their religion . When Mohammad , the founder of the religion , called out to all Muslims -- and that 's how he won most of his wars , by saying , `` I have been ordered and all believing men have been ordered to attack and kill and maim anyone unless they testify , unless all men testify to the fact that Allah is the one and only , Mohammad is his messenger , my father disobeys that . </s>
Well , Maajid Nawaz tried to obey that first and then stopped obeying it . But the fact that that scripture is there and that history of militarism is there belies the motion that Islam is a religion of peace . The point I want to make is Islam is a religion , when you take the scripture , that can be employed to wage war , and Islam as a civilization has known periods of peace , but you can not -- if you pay attention to that history , pay attention to the evidence -- continue to say that Islam is a religion of peace . No monotheistic religion is a religion of peace . </s>
No monotheistic religion is only a religion of war . It is both . But in Islam , and that 's why we are debating it in the 21st Century , there are more occurrences of violence and war and strife and subjection of women then there are in other religions . And my point -- our point is , let 's not deny it , because by denying it we do n't solve the problem . Let 's admit it and then as intelligent people take it from there . </s>
What is to blame on external factors , what is to blame on the inside ? Let me just hear opponent Maajid Nawaz , who was an extremist , now an anti-extremist , Maajid , respond . So , forgive me for the assumption , Ayaan , it 's a pleasure to be on the panel with you , by the way , but forgive me for the assumption , but do you speak Arabic ? Have you studied Arabic grammar ? </s>
And I 'm asking for a purpose , which if you do give me the chance to explain I will , but that first of all just let me ask you that question . I do n't speak it as well as you do . And I want to know where the question is going before I give a full answer to that . If you want me to quote the Koran I will . </s>
You may be surprised , I do n't know if I speak well or not , but the reason I 'm asking is that you just quoted hadith , of the prophet , and you actually really did exaggerate what he said , and I 'll quote to you the exact hadith in Arabic and then translate it . Now , what you quoted was -- It’s actually the Koran , but go on . Well , Hadith is -- It’s chapter 2 , 191 to 193 -- </s>
Wait , just -- Now , what you quoted and in the translation was , `` Kill and maim , '' and you went on and explained . Now actually means `` to fight . '' Now , I 'm not saying that that 's a good Hadith . What I 'm saying is when we 're translating , let 's try and be accurate . </s>
And that brings me to the point , and that is that I just thought of a word to describe this , and it 's just come to me so thank you because I want to use it forever onwards , and that is suspended intelligence . There 's a tendency when discussing Islam to suspend the tools that we have learned and studied , and that you have studied as well , that we use to analyze every other piece of scripture and literature in the world , and that is that we recognize that texts do not speak for themselves . We recognize that when we interpret scriptures and texts and books and poetry that they are contextualized , that we have methodologies to approach them , when we 're reading Shakespeare , when we 're reading anything . We recognize that there 's a way to interpret text and there are schools of thought and differences over how to approach texts . </s>
Now , if we contextualize Martin Luther , and say the Reformation was a good thing , despite the fact that he said , `` Kill and slay the peasants wherever you find them , '' when they follow Thomas Muntzer -- when he was calling for not just breaking away from the papal authority but also for rebelling against the monarchies and the dictators that they found themselves in -- Martin Luther sided with the tyrants against Muntzer , and said , `` Kill the peasants wherever you find them . '' Despite that , I 'm prepared to say the Reformation was a good thing . And the reason I 'm prepared to say that is that Martin Luther must not be judged by the standards of civilization that we , after an accumulation of thousands of years , have arrived at . </s>
He must be judged by the standards of civilization that were around during his time . And that 's how society evolves . Hang on . And we recognize that for every other faith and for every other piece of literature , yet when it comes to Islam somehow we want to suspend . </s>
But we learned about that and quote the . Yes , we read things in their context . </s>
I mean , you read Chaucer in context . Chaucer does n't have followers , does n't have 1.4 billion people who believe every , or are meant to believe -- </s>
Sorry , I quoted Martin Luther not Chaucer . I suppose Martin Luther does have followers -- </s>
If you allowed me to speak , I would address your lesser point . I will get there I promise . You don’t -- we don’t have followers of Shakespeare who insist on , going to insist on following line-by-line everything Shakespeare did and believing everything he wrote . That’s because it’s literature . Actually what’s happening , Maajid , you put your finger on the problem . </s>
It’s not us that’s not applying the rigorous critical faculty . We’re applying it to the Koran as we would to any other work of literature . You’re not because you can’t . And the final thing is , Maajid , because Maajid knows very well that -- He is a believer and believers are not allowed to contextualize the text . </s>
Is that true ? Because if you were allowed to contextualize , you would say some of the things that Mohammad did is crap . You would say some of the deeds -- Maajid , is it true that you can not -- You can not contextualize . </s>
Maajid , is that true ? No , that’s not true . </s>
What do you think of Mohammad taking a six year old as a bride ? What do you think of that ? </s>
I don’t think that’s a particularly good idea . However , what I would say -- Glad to hear it . </s>
There were many , many people in history that have done such a thing and what we’re talking about here is a failure to contextualize actions for the standards of their time . And I’ll come back to the point I made , because Douglas , you didn’t address it , despite your protestations -- </s>
I -- Let me just ask you again . Martin Luther was a fundamentalist , wasn’t he ? Absolutely . If there were currently Lutherans , and there are Lutherans around . </s>
You meet them occasionally in Scandinavia and so on . Very nice people . Very nice people and peaceable guys they are by and large . If , however , there was a large proportion of Lutherans somewhere in Scandinavia that started blowing up non- Lutherans -- or no , sorry absolutely right -- started massacring peasants , do you think that people would say , hang on a minute , “Let’s not criticize Martin Luther . He did that by the standards of his time . </s>
We shouldn’t criticize his followers all that much . We shouldn’t point out that what he said.” </s>
No . We just say , “You know , don’t go and massacre peasants . </s>
Full stop . It was rubbish at the time and it is now.” It’s the same with the Koran . </s>
You’re missing the point . You’re failing to judge -- I just wanted to point out , when we’re talking about the Koran and saying that we can’t contextualize it , that’s simply not true . That is a debate that’s hot in the community amongst Muslim scholars and amongst Muslims themselves . </s>
We’re debating that very question . Is the Koran a living document ? Much like -- it’s similar in comparison to the Constitution and the debates that happen around that . The fact is scholars say that when you look at the Koran in Arabic , there can be two , three , four , five , six interpretations for every word . </s>
There’re only certain things in the Koran that scholars agree are concrete , like the concept of God , afterlife , things like that . But beyond that there is a wide , wide range of interpretation , which is why there is a history that not many people look at , and that’s part of the problem . That nobody’s actually looked at the history of debate within Islam about every sort of aspect that can come to mind . </s>
I disagree with that . </s>
The reason I disagree with that -- it would be more accurate , Zeba , if you said the scholars that you find attractive say that . But there’s a bunch of scholars , a great number of following in Islam , take -- all of them are self-appointed by the way , because there is no higher education , there is no seminary of Islam , except the University of Al-Azhar , we know the products of Al-Azhar , but there are scholars like bin Laden who say we have to take -- He’s not a scholar by anyone’s measure . Well he has the greatest following . </s>
He has the greatest following . That’s not true . </s>
The Islamic Brotherhood , Hassan al-Banna , when you to look at the Sunni Islam . When you look at the Ayatollah Khomeini in the 20th Century , the most influential guy of Shia Islam is another self-appointed scholar . Sheikh bin Baz , he has the greatest following . Sheikh al Qaradawi . </s>
Maybe these are individuals that are not attractive to you , but then it would be more accurate if you stated that . They are attractive to many Muslims , not thousands but in the millions , and what they say -- and that’s why they’re influential -- is they challenge every single Muslim individual , are you a true Muslim ? </s>
If you are a true Muslim , you live by what the Koran dictates , you follow the example of the Prophet Mohammad . Right . Their interpretation , though . </s>
Those scholars insist on that , are far more influential , far more powerful than your soft- spoken , wonderful , cuddly scholars . Ayaan , you just quoted bin Laden as a scholar . </s>
Hassan al-Banna as a scholar . Bin Laden , for those of you who don’t know , is an engineer , a qualified engineer . So you do n't know him . Why do n't you define whose -- Don’t know his history . </s>
He 's a qualified engineer who comes from one of the richest construction families in Saudi Arabia and was educated in the elite private schools of Switzerland and Saudi Arabia . Hassan al-Banna that you referred to was a school teacher . And in fact what you find common with all of the movements that you are worried about , and that I am worried about , and we 're all worried about , are that they are founded by people who do not have a theological background . </s>
Now , for all we think about Al-Azhar , and they have very conservative views , what we do n't find is that Al- Azhar produces the likes of bin Laden and Hassan al-Banna , or even Maududi , the founder of Jamaat-e-Islami Islam in the Indian subcontinent . </s>
Maududi was a journalist . Sayyid Qutb , the founder of modern day Jihadism , was a literary critic who came to America on a scholarship in the 1950s to study literature . He was not a theologian . So coming back to the point -- Why do n't you name a number of scholars who are influential who are not -- </s>
Please , Ayaan , do n't define for the whole world who a Muslim scholar is , because actually the people you referred to were not qualified theologians . </s>
But do n't you touch on the problem by admitting this ? Do n't you touch on the problem that is inherent in Islam after the death of Mohammad , that the problem of who speaks for Islam has not been resolved . It could be the two of you . It could be bin Laden . It could be al Qaradawi . </s>
It could be Faisal Shahzad . Hang on . </s>
The question is , what does that have to do with Islam being a religion of peace ? You 're almost making the argument that Islam is what you want it to be , depending on how you behave . So if you behave peacefully , is it not a religion of peace to you . That is a brilliant question . </s>
You can start by saying Islam is something to -- a different thing to 1.57 billion people . And from that general point , you can reduce it to what is it that unifies them ? And ultimately , you will get to the Koran and the hadith . The Koran , the hadith , the day of judgment . The belief in the day of judgment , and if you take those three concepts , then it 's far from a religion of peace because you look , first of all , not only at the content of the Koran -- in context , fine . </s>
I am willing to contextualize it . But what if other believes are not , and they 're influential ? What if I want to read Mohammad 's practices simply as a matter of history , another great figure in history ? </s>
But more Muslims , millions of Muslims do n't want to do that and really want to follow his practices . What if more and more Muslims invest in the hereafter more than they invest in life ? </s>
Then we have a problem . And that 's why I ask you to vote against the motion , it can not be only a religion of peace , because if it were only a religion of peace , if it were perfect , why would we have this debate , why would we -- </s>
Douglas , given the long run that Ayaan had , can you be 15 seconds ? Imagine trying to imply that the whole extremist problem is a misreading by engineers and literary critics . Unfortunately , that 's simply not the case , has n't been historically in Islam , and is n't now . Ayatollah Khomeini , who Ayaan mentioned earlier , was not a self- trained engineer , rich boy , like -- you know , unfortunately , and managed to hurtle a very developed , distinguished culture back in time in 1979 , and hurtled this country back into the state it 's currently in , under these cloaked dictators . </s>
The Grand Mufti of Egypt is not a self taught -- All right . We seem to be going -- and I do n't need a list . </s>
-- that all Muslims should go and fight the Israelis . Maajid . Sorry . On Khomeini . </s>
I acknowledge Khomeini is a trained theologian . </s>
And the fact is he came in the '70s , Douglas . And that proves something . What was he so famous for ? Khomeini was recognized for bringing a revolution in Shiite theology . </s>
And what was the revolution ? Those of you who have studied this will know that the revolution was , up until him , Shiites had been avowedly religiously secular , because they believed no one had the right to rule in God 's name until the Messiah came , and let them wait for that Messiah until the end of time . Khomeini changed that and turned it on its head . And if that proves something , it proves one thing , and that is it was not in -- it was not consistent with Islamic Shiite tradition . </s>
What he did was a very modern revolution , influenced by his studies in Europe and influenced by modern European fascism . He broke from tradition , and that 's why it was called a revolution . He was not a continuant of Shiite traditionalism . It 's the fault of the Europeans , in other words . No , no . </s>
No one 's saying it 's -- Remember , the -- Come on -- </s>
I want to ask you something about reforms for Islam . Does Islam need reform ? It needs a renaissance . It does n't need a reform . </s>
Reform in the sense -- and the reason I say that is because we have to be careful of our terminology . If we say reform as in Reformation , we 're thinking of a Christian context where you had the Protestants and Martin Luther rejecting the Catholicism and the Pope . But the thing is in Islam , there is no Pope . </s>
There is no centralized authority . So there ca n't be a reformation in that sense . What there needs to be is a return to genuine Islamic principles which have been not studies , have not been enforced and were forgotten . So it 's not exactly that . A return to genuine Islamic principles is exactly what al-Qaeda is advocating . </s>
No , that 's not actually what they 're -- no , that 's actually incorrect . A return , a rebirth -- I 'm sorry , the radio can not make sense of two voices . </s>
And I am talking now too at the same time . So I 'm going to be quiet . I 'm going to give you 20 seconds to make that point , and then I want to hear back . </s>
So a succinct 20 seconds . When you look at the extremist -- the organizations that we 've come to call extremist , where they 're advocating , when they answer the question what went wrong , we had this empire , we lost it , how do we regain it ? Their answer is a rebirth . Let 's go back to the origins , a revival of it . Is that what you want , Zeba ? </s>
No . They actually co-opt the language for their own political purposes . Al-Qaeda is not calling for a return to Islam or to original Islam or anything like that . They 're actually using Islam as a cover for their political grievances . </s>
When you look at and ask Muslims , ask 1.5 billion Muslims , when you look at the mainstream , they 're 90 percent . They 're peaceful and fine . </s>
When you look at the politically radicalized , when you ask them what do they fear most ? They say Western domination and occupation . But when you ask mainstream Muslims what they fear , they say economic issues , unemployment . </s>
There 's a clear difference . And so they are not -- what we can determine from that is it 's not religion because religiosity between the two is indistinguishable , how pious they are , indistinguishable . It 's the one factor that makes the difference is what they focus on and their grievances against -- perceived grievances against the West . </s>
Douglas Murray . But do n't we get back to one of the core problems which you still have n't addressed , which is the life of Mohammad and his teachings , which is as follows . If a Christian group decides to go back to the teachings of Christ , you know , the worst stuff they find is the Sermon on the Mount of Olive . They find one verse where Jesus is saying , I think in the Gospel of Matthew , to have said “I come not to bring peace but a sword.” But the rest of it is all love thy neighbor and all that sort of stuff . </s>
If you 're a Christian group looking to go back to the sources of Christianity , you just find a lot of , well , hippie stuff , for a lot of modern people . So what is it about this religion we 're talking about tonight that you say is a religion of peace , that when people go back to the origins , they find a founder who was violent , teaching violence . See , this comes back to what you mean by people going back to the origins . And I refuse , as does Zeba , and as we 're asking for all of you to do , is to refuse for Islam to be hijacked and monopolized by the Bin Ladens of this world who want to tell you what it means to go back to the original sources . Now , if that was the case , then I ask you why is it that in Bangladesh , where there was a free and fair election , the Islamist party lost roundly . </s>
They completely lost the elections . </s>
In Pakistan , where there were recent elections , the Islamist alliance in the north that came to prominence after the occupation of Afghanistan , they completely lost all their seats . </s>
So the Muslims in two of the most populous Muslim majority countries in the world , as like as is the case in Indonesia , whenever they have a chance to vote , they do not vote for the Islamist extremists . And time and time again in elections across Muslim majority states , they have proven that their interpretation of Islam -- and they are the majority -- is not the interpretation of Douglas , Ayaan and bin Laden . </s>
Now , I do n't want to be in that camp . All right . I want to take a little break and move on to the topic and the status of women in Islam . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . This is an Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York City . Our motion is “Islam is a religion of peace.” </s>
We have two teams of two . Arguing for the motion , Zeba Khan and Maajid Nawaz . And arguing against the motion , Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Douglas Murray . </s>
One of the -- here in the West , one of the issues that is very complicated for people in coming to terms with what they think Islam is , is the status of women in Islam . I 'd like to go to Zeba Khan . Take that on . You know what I 'm talking about . The perception is that for a lot of people looking at the Muslim world in Muslim majority countries is that Muslim women are somehow -- they are n't -- they 're subjugated , that they do n't -- to a point where they are intimidated to ask for their rights and to demand them . </s>
But that 's not the case . I mean , when you look at all -- when you look across Muslim majority countries , if you look at Iran , for example , where there is zero gender gap in education , by the way -- men and women enjoy the same amount of education . </s>
Obviously when you 're at that level of education , you 're aware of what your rights are and what you are demanding . </s>
And so in Iran and places like that , they are demanding their rights , they are pushing for them . </s>
In places like Afghanistan or Pakistan where the gender gap is larger , that gap obviously needs to be filled . But there are women who are pushing there as well . It 's women that are stepping up and taking the lead on this . Other side response ? </s>
Ayaan Hirsi Ali . Well , when I tried to define Islam as a religion , religion there is expression , you find in the Koran is expression after expression , verse after verse , and also in the Hadith , that women are subordinate to men , that they have a guardian -- they need to have a guardian , their testimony is worth half of that of men , they can only inherit half of what their brother inherits . When it comes to sexual offenses , women are the ones who get -- in reality , where Sharia is implemented , and that is not only the practical side of Islam but also the fellowship side of Islam -- everywhere where Sharia is implemented , and there are more places in the world today where Sharia as a family law is implemented and where it 's not implemented on a political level , but in all of those places you see a subjugation of women . </s>
You see honor killings . You see women who are denied education . </s>
If you look on a global level , levels of illiteracy among women in the Middle East is appalling . That 's not something that I 'm telling you because I misunderstand Islam , but that is report after report , and the latest one is the United Nations , the UNDP Human Development Report that was first published in 2002 and was again published in 2003 , 2004 . And if you follow these reports , this is empirics -- this is not something that I 'm imagining -- the situation of women in the Middle East in Muslim countries is dire . </s>
And the principles that underlie it and the practices are Islamic , it 's Sharia law in action . And the appalling -- the nightmare is women who have fled those countries who are now in the West -- American citizens , European citizens , are subjected to parts of Sharia law . </s>
And Zeba , I think that denying that -- not just as a matter of debate but , I then try to question , `` Where does your solidarity lie as a woman who grew up in a free country , a free woman , and as vocal as you are , should n't you be more solidaire with them ? ” </s>
I am . Zeba Khan . I am . </s>
But I do n't want to -- I absolutely am and as all women should be and all human beings should demand the rights of equality . In fact , most Muslims want equal rights for the women in their societies , and just go to the research , go to the polls , go to the research and what it says . When you ask men , `` Should women have equal rights ? '' majority in countries surveyed in the Gallup survey said , `` Yes , they should have equal rights , '' including in Saudi Arabia . Maajid Nawaz . </s>
I want to acknowledge that there -- a lot more needs to be done and a lot more needs to be said about eliminating some of the practices that you referred to , Ayaan . </s>
And I recognize that there are practices in Muslim majority societies across the world that are repugnant not just to a Western mind but generally to any decent rational human being . But I 'm going to approach this being a man , and the first man on the panel to call in on this question , I want to approach this from a slightly different angle , and that is this , that many of you in the audience are men , and if the law of average was to fall true , then you 'd be probably around 50 percent . Now , how many of you would be comfortable with your spouse , your wife as your boss at the same time ? </s>
And it may sound -- you know , it may actually be a truism because for many people in a marriage the boss is the wife , but - - -- the reason I 'm asking that question is that even in times like today , many men find that uncomfortable , to be married to their boss , and yet Ayaan , who referred to these practices that were repugnant to us and said that they are sourced in Islam , the founder of Islam , the prophet , Mohammad , his boss -- his first wife was his boss . And many people do n't know that . And so what I want to demonstrate by this point is that it 's a complex matter . </s>
There are practices in Muslim majority societies that we need to reform , but it 's too simplistic to trace them back to the life of a man who lived 1,400 years ago . And in many of these practices , what 's quite revolutionary for his time , and in others was like every other man during his time . </s>
The fact that he referred to -- Douglas refers to the fact that he had a bride that was underage , is something which we can now look back on and say , `` That was an awful practice , '' but just as we look back on many things the Romans did and say that was an awful practice , just as we look back on many things Martin Luther did and say that was an awful practice , but we don’t judge these men by the standards that we have today . Yeah , we do , we should . We should , Maajid , and may I say it’s a bit too cutesy to compare a man who raped a 9-year-old girl repeatedly with men being kind of , you know , kind of the wife , the bit of the wife being the master of the household and so on . A bit too cutesy . A bit too much of avoiding the issue , which is this . </s>
This is actually a very real concern which doesn’t just apply in mid-7th Century Arabia but today , here and now , in Britain , in my own country . We now have , thanks to an arbitration act put into law in 1990 , whereby people can have civil disputes arbitrated under laws they can decide on . But we now have Sharia courts in Great Britain and Sharia courts in Great Britain are operated by people who are , actually , clerics , they are religious authorities . There’s one , well , Sadiqi in Leicester . </s>
Now this man runs a separate Sharia court . A couple of years ago it turned out that we found out about the sort of thing he was deciding , and sadly , again , it’s not reformist stuff , because when you go back to the Sharia , people take lessons from it and they make judgments like the following . Six women , six women who had gone to the Sharia court because they were being physically abused by their husbands , they were persuaded to drop the cases because this should be a matter between a Muslim woman and Muslim husband in a Sharia court . </s>
This should not be a matter for the police in Great Britain in 2008 . That stinks . What’s more , there had been another case . </s>
A local man , a local Muslim man , died . His will was arbitrated by Sharia because that is what happens now in 21st Century Britain . And the arbitration of this man’s will gave half the inheritance to the daughters as to the sons of the man , because that’s what they have in the Koran . </s>
Maajid said that he agrees with you that this stuff needs to change . Yeah , the point is that when you look at the courts that are doing this , when you look at the religious authorities , when you look at the clerics the judgments they’re making , those are the kind of judgments . I wish that Maajid would get some clerics on his side who could set up rival Sharia courts that didn’t decide that women were second class citizens but sadly at the moment that is the case . But Douglas , the irony was , as you know well , the person who came out most publicly in support of those regrettable Sharia courts in the U.K. was the Archbishop of Canterbury . And we at Quilliam opposed their creation , and actually many Muslims in Britain do oppose them because it raises a question . </s>
Islam has never had a clergy . It’s never had a pope . And so when you try and institute Sharia courts as law , the question arises , whose Sharia do you follow ? </s>
Now that’s an internal debate that’s going on and raging and that I am part of in Pakistan for example , because there isn’t one version of Sharia and everything you’ve referred to is bad . We condemn these practices . The fact is we can’t call them -- we can’t be reductionist , essentialist , simplistic , and call it Sharia because there isn’t on Sharia as you well know , just as there isn’t one reading of Shakespeare . I want to move on and when we come back we’re going to take questions from the audience . </s>
All right , so we’re going to take questions from the audience now and if you raise your hand , what I’ll do is I’ll take a cluster of questions and then start presenting them to the panel . And I just want to remind you , if you get a microphone , please stand up and hold it about two-fifths away from your mouth so that the radio can pick you up . </s>
And please keep it as terse as possible . Right against the wall there , and blue shirt here , and eyeglasses . </s>
Three . So , you get 30 seconds to ask your question . </s>
It makes me nervous that you’ve got something written down on a piece of paper . Under 30 seconds . I promise . </s>
All right . </s>
Go ahead . Zeba , in your opening remarks you said that Islamic terrorists are motivated by politics , not religion . Considering that Islamic terrorists make up the majority of suicide terrorists in the world today , what’s happening to Muslims politically that isn’t happening to any other major religious group that can account for the disproportionate amount of terrorism coming out of the Islamic world ? </s>
Bingo . That was a good question . </s>
Yeah . Yes , that was a great question . You’re number -- I’m going to take the questions and then you’re going to -- Oh , sorry . </s>
Yes , yeah , I’m ready for you . Oh , I’m sorry . There , with the microphone . Thank you . This has to do with the Muslim community’s reaction to suicide bombing . </s>
You stated there’s 1.5 billion Muslims and yet the silence of this community on suicide bombing , the justification , the rationalization , the wiggles from the community , from the religious community , from the Muslim states , Arab states and Muslim states , is something that , in the West , we find puzzling . How would the panelists react to that ? </s>
Thank you . </s>
And third question ? I hope this is n't too naive , but if religion is -- if Islam is not a religion of peace , is it possible for it to become one ? Well , I think that 's a great question , actually . </s>
I was trying to get at that with the reform issue , but I just think you put it far more eloquently . </s>
So I 'm going to take all those questions because I thought they were all good . Zeba , do you want to take the response to the first one , basically , why is the preponderance of terrorism -- the question you were saying -- is committed by Muslim extremists ; why are we not seeing that happening from other groups ? So what I do n't -- I ca n't say is -- I know that it 's a complicated question . </s>
And so you have history involved . You have different factors that contribute to the answer . What I can say for sure , just based on looking at the studies that come out , is that the level of religiosity , the level of piety , of violent terrorists compared to mainstream Muslims is virtually there 's no difference . </s>
So it 's literally when you ask them how practicing they are , how often do they attend services , things like that , it 's literally the same . So that ca n't be the distinguishing factor . What we do know , as I mentioned earlier , is when you ask them -- the one big difference is when you ask them what they fear the most , and they say their perceived idea of Western domination , which is very similar to what we hear from our opposition , a perceived fear of Islamic domination . </s>
And so when you compare that to the mainstream who just want to get a job and -- Would the other side like to respond to that question as well , or to the answer that you heard ? </s>
And if not , we 'll move on . We 'll -- I 'll move on . Can I just add something ? </s>
Sure . Nawaz . I think just to add something , that it 's -- the preponderance has a lot to do with the spread of a certain ideology that I refer to as Islamism that has arisen in the post-colonial context and that was exported to the Middle East through geopolitics . Now , what happened was that there was a need for a cause to resist against colonialism . And Britain was a secular liberal country . </s>
The cause of the ideology that the Arabs adopted , who were resisting initially , was Arab socialism , Baathism . And that morphed into Islamism , which owes much of its origins to Arab socialism . </s>
And so what we find is that the spread of this ideology , pretty much like how post World War I Europe , with the identity crisis that emerged after the Weimar Republic led to the growth of fascism in Europe , with fascism in Italy , Naziism in Germany and totalitarian Stalinism in the USSR . We see the same thing playing out post empire in the Middle East . </s>
So what it 's related to is the spread of this ideology that has hijacked the minds of many young Muslims . And yes , Muslims need to do more to challenge this ideology . We are trying to convince them of that . But this is a very modern phenomenon . And I remind you , Khomeini is a modern phenomenon , and he created a revolution where he flipped Shiite theology on its head , as are the others , bin Laden , Sayyid Qutb , they are all modern phenomenon . </s>
Okay , Maajid , you have awakened the other side on this topic . Yes , because what -- Should have kept my mouth shut . Ayaan Hirsi Ali . Maajid , what you are saying is Islamism is invented by the British , Islamism has nothing to do with Islam . </s>
External , external , external , those poor Muslims who are seduced with the Koran and the activities of Mohammad , their own culture , their own convictions , their own history , they have -- you know -- they are only the victims . Ideas inspire . Ideas unite . Ideas people bring together . And Mohammad succeeded first and foremost in uniting a disparate Bedouin desert Arab group of people . </s>
And they unified , and they conquered . And when it worked , it was all Islam . When Muslims were successful , when they conquered lands , it was all great . It was Islam . </s>
Now that we are faced with this problem , it 's Islamism . It was created by the British Empire . I just want for the other side -- I do n't think we will ever be able to address this issue if we systematically refuse to acknowledge , and that is what that side of the panel is doing . </s>
No . Ayaan -- -- to -- let me finish it . </s>
Yep . -- to systematically -- systematically refuse to acknowledge the flaws of Islam . I grew up as a Muslim . I left Islam . Why did it do it ? </s>
Because I could n't hide away from the blemishes . And I believe we can improve that . </s>
I can believe we can inspire young Muslims and the youth bulge -- there are millions and millions of young Muslim men under the age of 30 . That in itself is a source of violence . I want to -- We can inspire them if we can only acknowledge that part of the problem is us , not just the British empire . </s>
I 'm not saying it 's the fault of the British . If I was going to say that , I would have joined a very successful British law firm -- What has Islamism got to do with Islam ? I 'm saying to you I would have been a lawyer , and I would have gone on with my life . I 'm taking responsibility for that , and I 'm trying to get others to take responsibility for the growth of Islamism within Muslim mind and challenge that . </s>
So no one 's blaming the British , and no one 's -- Islamism is not Islam . The second question was on the topic of -- and you almost got to it in your last answer , Maajid . </s>
But the second question is where is the clear-cut , broad condemnation of terrorism from Muslim leaders ? So there have been many , many such fatwas or pronouncements against suicide bombings . In many cases , they 're not reported . There does need to be more . </s>
However , I 'll give you an example of why , in some cases , there are n't more . </s>
Now , recently , we at Quilliam publicized a fatwa by Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri against terrorism , no ifs , no buts condemnation of suicide bombing and terrorism that Douglas -- always a pleasure to speak with you on the panel -- supported and was quoted in the press as supporting Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri’s fatwa against terrorism . Now , the reason why there are n't many more such examples , though there are quite a few , is because prior to Dr. Tahir-ul-Qadri issuing this fatwa , his colleague , who was also from the same way of thinking , was assassinated in Pakistan , was killed by a suicide bomber in a mosque where all the congregants who were praying were also blown to smithereens because he had the guts to simply give a sermon in that mosque condemning suicide bombings . And so this is why many people are scared , because it takes guts , I tell you , to go into Pakistan and try and challenge these extremists . That 's a country that does n't have much rule of law . </s>
It 's a country that 's struggling against the so-called Pakistani Taliban from taking over a third of their country . And they 're fighting that fight on the front lines . And there are those who are brave enough just to give a speech to condemn terrorism , and they 're blown to smithereens in their mosque while praying . Maajid . And surely , they 're religious people . </s>
They were praying in a mosque . </s>
You did support that fatwa . I did . It 's the only time I 've ever done a book review of a fatwa . The -- I 'm sorry to say , Maajid , you seem to have just proved our point . </s>
Yes . Am I -- Please explain . </s>
Is it -- I mean , this is a very important and a very interesting question why more people do n't stand up . </s>
I much admire Tahir-ul-Qadri for that fatwa , as I have other people who have stood up . For the number of times I have spoken behind closed doors and so on , and you say , why are n't you saying anything , they say because if I do speak up , I 'll be killed . </s>
Well , I address you again , ladies and gentlemen , to the motion . I 'm sorry . </s>
Sorry . Hang on . Hang on . How on earth -- how on earth does fear of being killed in Pakistan by a minority faction of extremists prove Islam is not a religion of peace ? Well , let me put it this way -- let me put it this way then . </s>
It takes -- no , sorry . Sorry . </s>
I 've got to -- because really , what you just said is really quite absurd . And I 've got to clarify . It takes one person to kill all of us here , one person in a suicide bombing . Now , if we were scared of saying what we 're saying now because of that one person , it does n't mean all of us love war and hate peace in any way whatsoever . </s>
It means we all fear that one person who could walk through that door with a suicide bomb jacket strapped to his chest . But Maajid , if we were discussing -- That 's an absurd argument , Douglas . -- here tonight , does anyone think that when a Quaker said , I am quite fearful about speaking up against certain things , and I say -- come on , this only happens with Islam . </s>
There is no other major faith in the world today -- </s>
For that to be true -- Where it is the case that people are fearful of addressing religion because they 're afraid they 'll be killed . For that to be true -- </s>
It 's only Islam . And we 're saying there 's a reason . I 'm afraid of being killed by apostates . </s>
And many of you who came here tonight came under unusual circumstances . I am not in government . I am not a powerful person . I am a citizen . </s>
I mean , just a normal ordinary -- Can you explain what you mean by unusual circumstances ? Unusual circumstances . You went through metal detectors to come to a debate in New York . I mean , talk about . </s>
That 's because it takes one person to get through those metal detectors and blow us up . Let me finish . Let me finish . </s>
It does n't mean the majority of people are terrorists . Let me finish . Let me finish . The people that I am protected against , and you as an audience , too , the individual who wants to kill me because I am an apostate of Islam is in inspired to do that from the scripture of Islam , the example of the prophet Mohammad , the clergy that preached to him and the reward he will get in the hereafter that is promised in the Koran . All of that is Islamic . </s>
The sooner you admit that -- I 'll tell you what he 's inspired by -- -- the sooner I can get rid of my bodyguard . </s>
He 's inspired . I 'll you what he 's inspired by -- Right . wanted to have the last word on this point because I want to go back to the young lady 's question . Sure . </s>
So I . He 's inspired by the very same interpretation of Islam that you have . He 's not inspired by Islam . </s>
He 's inspired by your interpretation of it that is Bin Laden 's interpretation of it . I 'm sorry -- And I 'm got to say one last thing . No . Wait , wait , wait . nothing . </s>
No , no , no , no . </s>
The thing is you 're not the one -- the only one on this panel , I have an al-Qaeda death threat on my head , too , because I 'm saying what I 'm saying . And what I am saying is that -- and I 've been attacked in Pakistan physically for saying this -- what I 'm saying is , enough to extremism , enough to terrorism , let 's separate Islam from extremism and disempower the minority of extremists who are trying to hijack a good faith . Of course , I mean , one of the points about it there is that one gets death threats . </s>
I mean , it 's just an unfortunate thing . I think Zeba and I are going to leave . I think it speaks for itself . </s>
I hope no one threatens the chair . Can you repeat the question that I liked so much ? If Islam is not a religion of peace , is it possible for it to become one ? My answer is yes , on condition that first of all Islam is not a religion of peace , and I hope that we 've demonstrated here tonight that it 's not . </s>
Can it become a religion of peace ? Yes , if a number of conditions are met . </s>
But what is it , for all of the people who practice it peacefully ? But let me complete the condition -- But what is that faith that they 're practicing , then ? </s>
-- and not only practice it peacefully , but we -- </s>
That 's the part that I 'm not finding in your explanation . Why are we having again , over and over again -- first of all , in my view no monotheistic religion because there is that divider between `` We '' and `` They '' and because when that unified -- when there are so many factors within every monotheistic religion that make it inherently aggressive , it 's not only Islam , but there are a number of factors that in the 21st Century combine -- again , there is the history of militarism and the awareness of that , there is the victim status , there is the youth bulge , let 's not forget that , there is the revival of that theology , the revival of the example of the prophet Mohammad , the investment in the hereafter . </s>
And you say a lot of people practice their religion in peace . What we know is that a lot of people are passive and actually not practicing their faith , are not practicing Islamic scripture -- Who are you to say who 's practicing -- Let me finish -- let me finish -- -- their faith and who 's not ? </s>
-- let me finish , -- It 's not for you to decide . I 'm the Muslim , you 're not . But let me finish . </s>
Let me finish . </s>
You are not practicing -- you are not practicing , let me - -- Really ? Are you -- </s>
No , but let me say , you are not practicing -- Let 's hear what she says -- wait a minute , I want to finish . Please , let 's hear what her point is . </s>
You are not practicing Chapter 2 of the Koran , verse 191 and 193 , `` And slay them wherever you find them , and drive them out of places whence they drove you out , for persecution of Muslims is worse than the slaughter of the nonbeliever . '' Chapter 2 , `` Let there be no compulsion in religion . '' You are not -- you are not -- Chapter 2 , `` Each community -- '' Yeah , okay , what is that -- okay , great , I love that . </s>
`` -- which has given direction as it follows , all of you compete in the performance of good deeds . '' Which proves my point -- </s>
This could go on for a long time -- Let me one person speak at a time and you will come back -- That proves my point . </s>
If you read the peaceful -- Start again because I was talking . That proves my point . If you read from the Koran and you say it 's a religion of no compulsion and you believe that that verse is practiced by a person like you , you will concede that there are other Muslims who will read the verse that I just quoted and be inspired to engage in acts of violence . And , by the way , the verse that you just said , it has a latter part that says , `` Except for the unbeliever -- '' </s>
Sure , I 'm sure every -- </s>
Let 's after this . well , my last point was that it is both , it 's not just a religion of peace , it 's also a religion of war , and both verses prove that . </s>
Okay , do you want to respond to that , Zeba , or do you want to -- Okay , Douglas . And that is an important one . </s>
Ayaan and I and people who make some of the points we make are often accused of taking bits of the Koran out of context . But I think you 've just seen a very good example of it from the other side . </s>
I 'm not saying that that is n't a good verse to live one 's life by . One can not just simply quote the verse about there being no compulsion in religion as though it does n't have a follow on -- And you ca n't quote the other ones either without context . It has a follow on . -- as though it does n't have a follow on , and as Ayaan has just showed you , it has a follow on . </s>
Yeah , so do those ones , as do those ones . </s>
So I think this gets back to the very important question the lady halfway back there made which is whether or not this can be a religion of peace . I believe it can be , and when I said earlier there are three types of Islam I identified . </s>
There 's the first one , the scriptures , the light from Mohammad and so on , bad . </s>
Second one , Sharia interpretations , bad . </s>
But , thirdly , the way Muslims live their lives today in this country and countries like it , that is our source for hope , and the source of hope for that is they individually use -- like many people do really , I 'm not a religious person . Ayaan is n't either . But we recognize the fact that people of religious faith have the right to that faith , should practice that faith , should have no fear of practicing that faith . There 's no problem with it . But it 's a private matter , and one which people come to very strange private arrangements about . </s>
And I just wanted to add this , which is that if those people are going to be able to reform that faith into a religion of peace you’re talking about . </s>
Then , yes , we would be the first people to encourage that . But if we’re going to have that debate , as I hope we’ve shown tonight , it has to start with honesty . </s>
Let’s do one more round of questions . Dana , do we have time for one more round ? Yeah . So I’m going to do it again . </s>
I would love to hear from an audience member who is a member of the Muslim community if you feel like speaking . And not that I’m profiling but I saw a lot of blond people raising their hands . And again , I realize it’s a complex world . </s>
That kind of profiling is allowed . Jihad Jane was blonde . All right . </s>
I’m going to take someone from the left . Yes , blond person , you can go . Anybody from the -- yeah , okay . Okay , go ahead . </s>
And then on the right side , yes . Okay . Ma’am , I see you . </s>
Yep . And again , remember the way that great question was phrased ? That’s how you do it . So for those in favor of the motion , my question is -- what she just read from the Koran . You didn’t agree with it and clearly you’re interpreting the religion as you will and in a very peaceful way , which is great , but do you ignore those parts ? </s>
How do you react to it ? You said there were multiple ways , just like we interpret the Constitution , there are multiple ways of interpreting what the Koran is saying . I just want to know exactly how you interpret that chapter she just read to us . Thank you . To that end , I happen to be Roman Catholic but my wife is Israeli and my son just went through his Bar Mitzvah . </s>
There is some pretty spicy stuff in Leviticus . I had no idea . But then Catholicism went through the reformation and enlightenment . I’m from Pakistan . </s>
I’m a Muslim from Pakistan and I just want to comment on the suicide bombings . There’s one almost every week and if you feel that as a nation , after being destroyed repeatedly since 9/11 , we would still be sympathetic to extremist sentiments when our , you know -- two of my students were killed in suicide bombings . What is your question ? </s>
My question is , I want you to consider what the value of the socio-economic , cultural factors , political dictatorships , what role do those factors play in making young people susceptible to extremism ? Do you not feel that Maajid covered that in his remarks , because I feel that he did ? </s>
Well I don’t think maybe the audience understands . Let me put it on hold then . And then the third person ? </s>
I have a question for Ayaan Hirsi Ali . </s>
I’m a Muslim woman and she was referring to the subjugation of women . </s>
This has to do with the subjugation of women . I’m from India and my question is , if women are not educated , you know , in a lot of Muslim countries , that’s the problem . Women are not educated . And when they’re not educated , they don’t know what their rights are and so they’re not going to demand their rights . </s>
That’s the whole point in not educating half the population . But my question to you is , what does that have to do with Islam , because according to my understanding of the Koran the first word that was revealed of the Koran to the Prophet Mohammed was read . That has to do with education . And the Koran -- So , can you give me a question in one sentence ? </s>
I know you can , so go for it . My question is , what does this have to do with Islam ? Because the Koran doesn’t say that , according to my understanding . </s>
Does it say educate men , do not educate women ? No where in the Koran have I found that . Let’s take that last question first , Ayaan . </s>
Thank you so much for that question . </s>
I completely agree with you that women in the Muslim world today -- not all of them , but most of them -- are denied education . The reasons that are given by those who do the denying are Islamic . They refer the concept of guardianship , so the guardian has the authority to decide whether he sends a girl to school or not , and for how long she goes to school . </s>
The main reason in Muslim countries where girls are sent to school -- Muslim communities where girls are sent to school , the main reason for pulling them out at the age of menstruation is the fear , the terror , that they might lose their virginity . </s>
That modesty , sexual modesty that is demanded of girls , which at first it preceded Islam , was a tribal Arab culture , elevated to religion in Islam , where people find , within the Koran , that -- and the hadith , that insistency on her virginity , on her being a virgin on the night of her wedding , that is one of the main reasons that is given . And if sexual emancipation were to occur within the Muslim world -- and I want to challenge a guy like Maajid Nawaz to take the forefront as a man by saying that you value a partner , a human being , more than her hymen . That would revolutionize Islam completely . That would -- it would take -- girls would go to school . They would be independent . </s>
They would be able to articulate what their rights are . And , more importantly , they could make Islam a religion of peace because they would bring their boys up to be employable , to be educated , and to pronounce suicide killings and martyrdom -- uneducated mothers , uneducated mothers are mothers whose children , whose boys , bad guys can take advantage of it . We 're at the point where normally we move on to our third round . </s>
We have these two questions standing out there . And I 'm going to extend it , with everybody 's acceptance , a few minutes of this section tonight . </s>
Nobody seems to be leaving , and no one 's asleep . So Maajid , if you can be very brief to that , and then I want to get to the last question . Well , actually , to be honest , I value a can of Diet Coke more than a hymen . I mean , really , everything 's more valuable to me than a hymen , and especially a woman . </s>
So I really do n't understand the point of your question there . But allow me to say , however , that every Muslim questioner from the audience today is not a true Muslim . </s>
And every one of you may be a Christian is not really a Christian . And any of you who may be a Jew is not really a Jew , because I have the absolute monopoly of defining all three of those religions for all of you . And , really , the passages that -- I 'm saying this because of the first question . And that is , the passages that were referred to about fight them wherever you see them . Now , the thing is really , the founding fathers of this great country who wrote the Constitution believed in slavery and were practicing slavery . </s>
Now , does that mean that we 're going to define the whole of America and its Constitution by that practice , or are we going to contextualize that practice and say that when they founded this country , slavery sand abolishing slavery was not at the forefront of their minds , but later on , it was abolished , and that 's an achievement for this country . It 's not something that defines this country . And so likewise these passages , yes , they can be used , and they are used in a problematic way . And it 's our responsibility , not just as Muslims , but as decent human beings , to go out there and challenge the abuse of these passages . But we must not forget that as if with every other document in history , it had its context , and it was abused . </s>
And now when we have gone ex post facto , we can look back to that and judge it with a very civilized standard that we 've arrived at and say that was wrong . Now , perhaps -- And let me put the question -- let me put that -- I may be defined . I want to put the question as it was phrased to Zeba , which was how do you filter out -- </s>
Right , exactly . How do you filter that out ? So how do I interpret is what you 're asking . Despite what our opposition says , I do have that right . And basically , I look at my faith -- I 'm sorry . </s>
Who asked the question ? I look at my faith and the way I was raised with core Islamic principles , which is how my family raised me , and that I determined as an adult were correct , which is compassion and tolerance and plurality and strength and diversity , because we are a diverse population . </s>
There are as many interpretations of Islam as there are people . And so the other point I want to make to that is that there are clergy and clerics who do stress this . I mean , if you look at 2005 at the Imam Message , where 200 Muslim scholars from 50 countries addressed a reemphasis of Islam 's core values of compassion , mutual respect , acceptance , freedom of religion . There is precedent for this not just for me as a layperson but from the clergy as well , to reassert these lost -- in some areas , lost values . Douglas Murray . </s>
This is a very , very complex one . But it has to be said . </s>
Maajid has just given the comparison of the founding fathers , and there has to be some clarity about this . </s>
This country rightly reveres your founding fathers . But you do n't think that their word was immutable or unchangeable . </s>
No . You do n't believe -- I do n't know . </s>
I do n't think that anyone in this room who criticized Mr. Jefferson now here tonight , will be declared an anti-American apostate who can be fit for slaughter . </s>
The problem that our opponents have to address , they have to address it , is that a religion which is based on the idea that the Koran was dictated direct by God to Mohammad and that therefore if you are criticizing the Koran or throwing out a bit or pulling it apart , like most Christians and Jews -- most Christians and Jews have come to that stage where pretty much you pick a mix with your holy scriptures . </s>
And it 's quite a good , humane way around it . But with Islam , if this is the revealed word of God , revealed , it has to be said , as it was shown again earlier tonight in a particularly obscure and unreadable dialect , which -- if it was meant to be understood by the whole of the world , it 's a bad place to start . If this were the case , then , as I say , we come back to this problem . </s>
Founding fathers did -- said many great things and did some bad things . But you are not committed as Americans not to criticize the bad things they did . And this is a problem our opponents are going to have address . And that concludes round two of our debate . </s>
So here is where we are . We are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater . They will be two minutes each . And this is their last chance to change your minds and to respond to some of what 's been said over the last hour . </s>
You will be asked to vote , once again , and to pick the winner , just a few minutes from now . But first on to round three , closing statements . Our motion is , “Islam is a religion of peace.” And speaking first against the motion , Ayaan Hirsi Ali , a resident scholar at the American enterprise institute and a critic of fundamentalist Islam . Islam is not a religion of peace . </s>
And I woke up to the facts on the 11th of September , 2001 . Perhaps I should have woken up to the facts earlier . </s>
But I admit that I did that then at that time . Talking to people of my faith , Islam , and my friends , and discussing with them , I remember all kind of fallacious arguments . But I remember one consistent thing , and that was to exempt Islam from any criticism . It was culture . It was n't Islam . </s>
But a religion is born in a culture . And if that culture is not peaceful , then that religion is not peaceful . </s>
I was told it 's politics . We 've heard it tonight many times . It 's not religion . But Islam not only has a pious dimension but it also has a political dimension , a complex system of laws , a political philosophy on how society should be organized . And if you look at that political system , it 's anything but peaceful . </s>
What emancipated me from the order to submit my will completely to Allah , which in practice means the concentration of power in the hands of a few , was to learn to think critically , the enlightenment . Vote against this motion and open up the flaws of Islam for debate in order that Muslims , those who are not yet emancipated , may take charge of their own reason , of their own faculty . Vote against the motion that Islam is a religion of peace and toss -- toss that fallacy into the trashcan of history . Thank you . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Ayaan Hirsi Ali . Our motion is Islam is a religion of peace . </s>
Now to summarize her position for the motion , Zeba Khan , writer and advocate for Muslim American civic engagement . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Faisal Shahzad , the underwear bomber , and the group of young men that were picked up in Pakistan , all of them were for violence and trying to attack our country and learning how to attack our country elsewhere . But the one thing that the media consistently forgets to mention or conveniently forgets to mention is who turned all of them in . It was Muslims . It was their families , because that is a Koranic principle , that you stand up for justice , even if it 's against yourself . And in this case , someone 's son or several people 's sons , the underwear bomber 's father who was Nigerian and not American , did this , turned him in , and sent word to the authorities . </s>
And a Senegalese merchant was one of the first unreported , but was one of the first people to see the Times Square attempted bomber . Our opponents have a very simplistic outlook on this -- on the world and what 's currently at stake . They see it being Islam versus the West . </s>
But the truth is it 's not . It 's between moderates and extremists of all kinds . </s>
And I urge you to vote for the motion because the overwhelming majority of Muslims , the facts are clear , they are peaceful , they 're mainstream , and they condemn violence against civilians and have no interest in terrorism , which is consistently as the woman in the audience said , are attacking Muslims , mainstream Muslims every day , brutally , and oppressing them because we do n't accept their version of Islam . I 'm asking for your help for -- as other people , as people of reason and of people of a moderate voice to support us as we fight them and we are fighting them , although we do n't hear it as often in the media , which focuses on violence and fear . </s>
But the fact is , Muslims have always been fighting them . Zeba Khan , your time is up . Thank you . Thank you very much . Our motion is , `` Islam is a Religion of Peace '' and here to summarize his position against the motion , Douglas Murray , bestselling author , founder , and Director of the Center for Social Cohesion . </s>
Thank you . Well , thank you for a very enlightening , I think , debate tonight . I think we on this side made it very clear that we don’t think there 's a fight between Islam and the West or Islam and civilization or anything else like that . </s>
We 've made a very clear set of points tonight , and one of those points , which I hope people bear in mind , is we have said repeatedly that it is in Muslims and their critical faculties , Muslims and their behavior , Muslims and their faith that we have hope . And it is in people like you that we have hope for the future , and if the motion were that Islam a century from now could be a religion of peace and people would be quoting Zeba and Maajid and seminal moments like this and that they had learned -- well , that would be terrific , but at the moment , tonight , you 're being asked to vote on whether Islam is now a religion of peace , is Islam a religion of peace ? I think it is very clear that it is not . This does not mean -- of course , it does n't mean that Muslims are all violent . </s>
We would never make that point . </s>
We never have made that point , nor does it mean that there is n't hope in the future , nor does it mean that we have to have continual clashes until the end of time , but it means we have to start by being honest . We have to be frank about what we see in Islamic history , in Islamic conquests , and in Islamic script . </s>
We have to be frank about that . In societies which Islam dominated , conquered , and subdued the peoples in the Middle Ages , people who were not Muslim were sometimes allowed to remain in those societies but they were allowed to do so only by having second class status . I would ask you tonight , ladies and gentlemen , not to be dhimmis , not to have second-class status , not to vote for things because you think it 's polite or because you think you have to say them but because you think they 're true . On that basis , the idea you could vote for the motion tonight is absurd . </s>
Islam is palpably , demonstrably , evidently not a religion of peace . Vote against this motion . Thank you . Thank you . Our motion is , `` Islam is a Religion of Peace . '' </s>
And our final speaker to argue for the motion that `` Islam is a Religion of Peace , '' Maajid Nawaz , Director of the Quilliam Foundation and formerly a member of a radical Islamist party . Thank you . Right . So I 'm not going to ask you to be polite . I would dread to think that that 's why you 'd vote for the motion . </s>
In fact , what I 'd like to do is give you four reasons to vote -- basically four reasons why the panel 's arguments are incorrect and four reasons then to vote for the motion . And as for the failure of the panel , I think number one is that there 's a failure to contextualize . As I 've tried to say time and time again , there 's a failure to contextualize history and texts and sources , and there 's an intellectual suspension that occurs when discussing Islam that simply does n't occur when discussing the Constitution or any other piece of literature or writing . Secondly , there 's a failure to disclose . </s>
And as we 've heard from the panel , both of them -- and there 's nothing wrong with this , by the way -- both of them are not believers of any faith , and that 's their perfect right to do so , but they 've made it clear their real agenda is with all religions . </s>
And I think we have to be honest with ourselves , that actually religions can and have historically played much good and have come to much good in the world , including the Reformation despite the fact we have to contextualize it . Thirdly , there 's a failure to nuance , and as we 've heard , gross generalizations about Islam by quoting isolated passages are being made . And fourthly there 's a failure to be honest . And that honesty is in refusing to recognize that a vast majority of Muslims where there have been democratic elections have refused to turn in the extremists , as the examples I 've cited in Bangladesh and Pakistan . Now , please vote for the motion , and the reason I 'd say that is reclaim Islam , do n't let the minority hijack it . </s>
Yes , even for those of you who are not Muslims , reclaim it , because it 's a faith like all other faiths that does need to be redefined in current times . </s>
Secondly , vote for peace . This is not a vote for Islam . It 's a vote for peace . And I 'm sure all of us want peace . And thirdly I 'd say help the confused Muslims in the world , the factions , the minority , the young minds , like I was , who are confused , help them make up their minds by giving them guidance , by giving them an olive branch and voting for peace tonight . </s>
And finally , I’d say that even if you’re unsure , even if you think that Islam is not a religion for peace , I would ask all of you hear tonight to vote as we heard the admission from the panel , it can be a religion of peace , so vote for what you’d like Islam to be . </s>
If you’d like Islam to be a religion of peace , then vote for it . Thank you . And that concludes our closing statements , and now it’s time to learn which side you feel has argued the best . </s>
Sorry ? Okay , yes . Now it’s time to learn which side has argued best . We are asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote . </s>
We’ll get this read out almost instantaneously . Our motion is “Islam is a religion of peace.” </s>
If you agree with the motion , push number one , if you disagree , if you’re against the motion , push number two . If you’re undecided , push number three and we’ll have the results in about a minute . Before we get there , I just want to say this has been probably the most spirited debate that we’ve ever had and I thought it was conducted mostly with respect and with honesty and I want to congratulate all of our panelists for coming out here . I want to thank all of you in our audience . The questions were all excellent , including , ma’am , the one I didn’t get to . </s>
I apologize . </s>
It was a time issue . But the questions were terrific and I want to thank all of you for coming through the metal detectors , which were a metaphor in a way for the situation that we’re in and the reason that we’re debating this topic . </s>
But you should give yourselves a round of applause for being here for taking part in this tonight . </s>
I want to let you know that our next debate will be on Tuesday , the 26th of October . </s>
The motion then is , “Big government is stifling the American spirit.” Panelists for the motion are former Texas Senator and vice chairman at UBS Investment Bank , Phil Graham , and Art Laffer , a former Reagan economic advisor who’s known as the father of supply side economics . Against the motion , NYU Stern Business School professor , Nouriel Roubini and Laura Tyson who is a professor at the Haass School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley and a member of President Obama’s economic recovery advisory board .

After the debate , 36 percent are for the motion and 55 percent against , nine percent undecided . </s>
Decides against the motion wins . Congratulations to them . Thank you from me , John Donvan , and Intelligence Squared U.S. End Time : ( 20:39:01 ) Good evening , everyone . </s>
Good evening , everyone . I would like to begin our evening by introducing the CEO of Intelligence Squared US , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Thank you all for being here and welcome . You know , there’s not much of a debate about whether mainstream media is declining . The network evening news audience is shrinking , daily newspapers are folding , established magazine titles are being shut down . Nearly one of every five newspaper journalists has been fired in the last couple of years . </s>
Increasingly people get their news from the Internet and from cable channels . In the past two years the number of people in the US going online for news has jumped 19 percent . Advertisers are moving to Google and to other non-traditional sources . But there is a very interesting debate about whether these developments leave us better off or worse off . Now no one seriously questions that a free press is an essential national value . </s>
And a free press does not come cheap . The major networks and leading newspapers have traditionally spent heavily on the news , they support foreign news bureaus , investigative reporting , in-depth news analysis , fact-checking and other quality controls . So why might we say , good riddance . </s>
Perhaps it’s because mainstream media did exercise extraordinary power , to shape the national agenda , and our perception of events . Might we be better off getting our news from an unfiltered Internet , to which all bloggers and news aggregators have equal access . </s>
Should we not encourage a diversity of voices competing to provide information and analysis . Can a network of bloggers tell us more about events on the ground than a reporter in a hotel bar in Baghdad or Cairo ? Or could we conceivably enjoy the best of both worlds , as mainstream media reinvents itself to thrive in a digital age . </s>
These are interesting questions , I think we’re going to have a lot of fun hearing them debated tonight , and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening back to John Donvan . Thank you . </s>
And may I just invite one more round of applause for the person who makes all of this possible , Robert Rosenkranz . Well , welcome , everyone , to another debate from Intelligence Squared US , I’m John Donvan of ABC News , and it is my honor once again to serve as host and moderator , as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . Three teams—sorry , two teams , three against three , will be debating this motion , “Good riddance to the mainstream media.” And I know that we have a hall full of journalists here , a topic that is close to many of our hearts , if not many of our throats . But it is an important topic for debate , and that’s what this is , it is a debate , a contest . </s>
There will be winners and losers tonight , and you the audience will be our judges , by the time the debate ends you will have voted twice , once before the debate , and once again after the debate on whether you side with or against the motion . You pick the winners . </s>
So let’s move on to our preliminary vote , and if you again look to the keypads on the left of your seats…that will be your little voting machine . Press number one if you agree with the motion , “Good riddance to the mainstream media , ” press number two if you disagree with the motion , and press number three if you are undecided . </s>
And if you make a mistake , just correct the mistake and the system will only record your last vote . Do you have to log in first ? </s>
You do not have to log in . You are logged in . We hope . All right , we’re going to lock it out… So let’s get to the debate , our topic is “Good riddance to the mainstream media , ” and this is a contest in which we hope to hear a clash of ideas and logic , and wit and perhaps humor , as each team tries to change your minds and tries to persuade you to their point of view , and speaking first for the motion , “Good riddance to the mainstream media , ” I’d like to introduce Michael Wolff , who in a way has one of the most mainstream of all media positions as a columnist for Vanity Fair but he also for some time has had a position on the other side of the technological divide having been involved in many Internet startups , including Newser.com which Michael , you say , has as one of its goals to kill newspapers , is that correct ? Well , also to make me rich . </s>
Make you rich , ladies and gentlemen… Is that working out ? Oh yes , of course . </s>
Michael Wolff— Always— —ladies and gentlemen . I went to work for the New York Times in 1973 , and I was going to say that that probably makes me one of the people who’s been in this business in this room the longest . But then I notice you’re an old crowd . </s>
My… My mother went to work as a daily reporter in 1942 , my father began as an ad man in 1946 , after the war . So , the thing that I know is that this business is always changing . So , the idea that somebody is going to defend the status quo of this business is to me a little silly . And my first point is , that we ought to remember , that this business , the business that those guys are going to defend , is a new creation . </s>
It’s at most , 20 years old . And it’s essentially— And the other thing that’s going to happen is that they’re going to talk about the news business , and that’s not the proposition , the proposition is the media business as it should be , because the news business has been subsumed by this superstructure . Now this superstructure , which essentially is five companies which dominate the landscape— Time Warner , Viacom-CBS , Newscorp , Disney , and NBC Universal . What these companies are are—listen to this—more than 1,000 independent media companies , which in the past 20 years have been aggregated into five . So what they’re going to be defending , is actually a business theory . </s>
And the theory is we bring all these companies together , and we create value . Here’s the point . </s>
That theory has been all but utterly exploded . Disproven . </s>
Break it down into its component parts . Look at its constituencies . </s>
From an audience point of view , the audience has been in flight for 20 years . Just yesterday , what we’ve learned is that there was , newspapers have lost another 10 percent of circulation , some newspapers are down in a year , 25 percent . </s>
You can see those numbers not just in newspapers , across the media landscape . Television networks , books , magazines , the music business , the movie business . </s>
And now the cable business . People are in flight from what was supposed to be the bastion of mainstream media . This is an extraordinary moment , it is a moment in which you see literally breakdown at every level . The… You have—it’s not only—you have an audience flight , you have an advertiser flight . </s>
What happens with advertisers , it used to be that consumer brands , you had 90 percent of consumer brand spending was in the mainstream media , that’s down to under 50 percent , why is that the case . Because it doesn’t work anymore . You have from a shareholder perspective , and this is key . Shareholder perspective , what you have is—well actually you’ve been screwed if you’re a shareholder in a modern media company . </s>
Media moguls rich , shareholders across the spectrum of these companies , are underwater , not one of these companies , in… 20 years has kept pace with the S & P . This is a devastating result . What you have is your customers , your—the consumer , the advertiser , and the marketplace itself , saying that there is something phenomenally wrong here . </s>
Technology . The media is a technology business . That’s what it is . That’s what it has always been . Technology changes , the media changes . </s>
There is no media without technology . We’re… We’ve come to a funny moment however in this business because the mainstream media is run by people who are fundamentally technology-phobes . They don’t get it , they don’t want to get it , they’re averse to it , they resist it . They are lost when it comes to making plans about it . I spent a lotta time in the recent past with Rupert Murdoch who runs I would say the leading-edge media company , and he runs it with an iron fist . </s>
He doesn’t run it with a computer because he doesn’t use one , he doesn’t run it with email because he doesn’t get email . And he can’t get that cell phone to work , he’s always kind of waving it…in the air . What you’re going to hear here tonight is that the media is necessary for the commonweal . An informed citizenry is what this nation is about . </s>
The media may be flawed but it delivers us what we need to know . That is self-serving crap . </s>
The New York Times , is a good newspaper , sometimes . The Washington Post is a good newspaper . The LA Times before it became a bad newspaper was a good newspaper . But after that , it’s off the cliff , it’s oblivion . The news business in this country is nothing to be proud of . </s>
What— You know , I think the thing to remember here—I mean the really important thing is that something else is happening , something is… This is easy . Change—and I have four seconds—change is good . And it’s happening and we are part of it , and we’re going to all tell our grandchildren that , we were here , we saw the monster die , and we saw the shock of the new— </s>
Michael Wolff , your time is up . Thank you . And— Thank you . </s>
I want to point out , I did not give you the structure of the evening , we are doing three rounds , Round 1 we’re in now is opening statements , Round 2 , the debaters will go head to head , in Round 3 we’ll have brief closing statements . We’re in— this is Round 1 , opening statements by each debater in turn , they are seven minutes each , the closing statements will be two minutes each . Now , moving on , the motion is “Good riddance to the mainstream media” and here to argue first against the motion is Phil Bronstein . Phil Bronstein began his career as a television reporter and over the years moved to print and became ultimately the editor of the San Francisco Chronicle , was there during the most difficult of times , and it was he who called the staff together , and said , the business model is broken , and no one knows how to fix it . Phil , was there a “yet” ? </s>
Yet . </s>
“Yet , ” in that , ladies and gentlemen , Phil Bronstein . Well , you all look very young to me . It’s a challenge to try and defend the vitality of something that’s already been declared dead . </s>
And no one has been quicker to declare it dead than people who have been preachers of the mainstream media , rushing to write the obituary . But let’s— first of all , I should caution you , we should be very careful tonight , because , we can’t touch on certain topics because , we could all go to jail if we do . What am I thinking , of course we can’t go to jail , we can talk about anything we want . And one of the reasons we can talk about anything we want is because the institutions that have made up the mainstream media , not over the past 20 or 30 years but over the last hundred years , have provided the authority , and the experience and frankly , the money , to stand toe to toe with government and all-powerful institutions and individuals . </s>
For your rights , for all of our rights , and for the benefit of all of us . I have some notes here because I’m a newspaper person , I like reliability to the extent that I get it . A few years ago , we had two reporters at the Chronicle facing 18 months in prison each , on the Balco steroids story , for refusing to be tools of government prosecution and in fact for just being reporters . Well , we spent two years , in addition to the time we spent on the story , two years defending these reporters , and a million dollars . </s>
Eve Burton , our chief corporate counsel at Hearst , who personally oversaw this case , I think is here tonight . That’s something that I’m not so sure , that these other emerging operations in media can do . Do they have the money . Does Talking Points Memo which does great work have the money , to do that . </s>
Have the will to do that . And you know the New York Times the other day just said that Barack Obama , about Barack Obama , the cover-up continues . So you may like this President more than you like the last one , but you may not like the next one . Because I can tell you from the Balco case experience , that that was a concerted effort on the part of the Bush administration , to go after the press , and its ability to report . </s>
I’m standing here very humbly tonight in the very long shadows of a lotta great editors , Ben Bradlee , John Carroll , Marty Barron , Gene Roberts , who are known for things , other than encounters with large reptiles , they’re known for working to change our world very profoundly . They do stories about the deaths of 300 kids in the Washington public school system . Fraudulent fertility packages , Walter Reade Hospital took at least half a year to do , sexual abuse by— of kids by members of the Catholic clergy , the Boston Globe , a year to do that . When Bill Keller went toe to toe with the Bush administration on domestic wiretapping you may not have liked the results of the negotiations but the fact that there was a debate , served us all . </s>
Served us all . I’m not here to defend a business proposition . As , I’ve already said , the business model’s broken , so I’m not going to do that . What I am defending is the idea of sustained professional journalism done with integrity and done in the public interest . </s>
And that is something that mainstream media has supported , we’ve gotten lost in all this business model discussion and disintermediation and granularization and it just , doesn’t get to the point . </s>
Our death by the way , would be I think a little untimely for the 50 million people who still pay to get a daily newspaper , for the 74 million people who go online , a month , of daily newspaper sites , and even for the $ 38 billion worth of advertising that still exists . But , another issue I think that we should raise , in terms of the service that we provide , that mainstream media has supported all these years , Freedom of Information Act requests . </s>
Now , Freedom of Information Act requests are sort of like a New York apartment with a view . They’re hard to get , it’s expensive , it’s time-consuming , but boy , what a result . These are windows , on very dark places occasionally and very corrupt places . </s>
Lucy Dalglish , and I’ll read the quote , director of Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press , “Access litigation has dried up , because of what’s happened to mainstream media.” And a public defender in Georgia wondered , quote , “Can underfunded bloggers , are they able to carry the financial burden of opening our courtrooms.” And that Georgia case in fact started , or was based on a case that—where the Riverside Press Enterprise , went to court to expensively—to open the courtroom . </s>
So , look . This isn’t just domestic , and it isn’t just about the government . </s>
Seth Mydans , an old colleague of mine from Southeast Asia , said not too long ago , when he shows up at places in Southeast Asia , for stories that matter to all of us…he’s often the only reporter . Well we’re supposed to be the witnesses to history . </s>
Where are the witnesses ? How are those witnesses going to be provided . I don’t think they’ll be provided solely by tweets from people on the streets of Tehran . An old colleague and mentor of mine , Max Vanzi of the Associated Press , when I went to the Philippines for the first time he said , here’s a clue . Nothing is ever what it seems . </s>
And I thought , oh , that’s a lotta help . But , the Hearst Corporation , and the Examiner at that point took care to give me five years to learn what that meant , and by the end of that five years I knew . You want to talk about corporate greed ? Well , we’ve also talked about nonprofit models , the Chronicle’s been unwillingly a nonprofit… newspaper for many years now . But despite that fact , because of a commitment to the kinds of things that I’m talking about , that are so important to us , the Chronicle remains in business . </s>
So from the New York Times taking on Boss Tweed in the 1870s , to a young William Randolph Hearst supporting blue-collar workers…the public has been very well-served by the mainstream media , and at a minimum we can’t afford to let it go , and kiss it off , because it’s entirely unclear what other form of journalism , support for that journalism , is going to be successful . I’m under , thank you very much . Thank you , Phil Bronstein , our motion is “Good riddance to the mainstream media.” And now speaking for the motion , Jim VandeHei , and Jim had the perfect job at a great paper , a respected political reporter at the Washington Post , he gave it all up , to start a start-up news organization . </s>
The good news is it turned out to be Politico.com . Ladies and gentlemen , Jim VandeHei . </s>
Thank you . I’m here to tell you that you not only look young , you look good too . And I urge you to vote for the proposition because , to be blunt , I think new media is better than old media , and I think that we’re the hope for them . I think—I agree with most of what Phil said , I agree that all that investment , all the accountability that old journalism has done , is great and that we need those values . </s>
But there’s also another side to mainstream media and another side to new media . For starters , mainstream media , for the longest time , I don’t think it was always as good as portrayed or always as great as we sort of mythicize . </s>
And , for the longest time it was basically run by old white men who are left of center who are deciding how all of us view the news , the only diversity was how much hair they had left or whether they drank gin or scotch . </s>
And what new media’s done is it’s injected a ton of vitality and a ton of competition into the media . And it’s also created , it gives you ideological , racial , and gender diversity that we never had before , and it gives all of us , all us news junkies , everyone in this room obviously cares a lot about news— It gives us a whole new menu of information to choose from . I also think , I—my background is I worked at the Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post and then we started Politico three years ago , so I think I’ve seen both sides of it . And I can tell you there’s probably a lot of businessmen and women in the audience because this is New York . And I think , I think your stomach would be turned if you went into some newspapers to see how they’re run , because they had profits that were so high for so long , an almost like not-for-profit mentality took on and there became distance between the institutions that were covering the news and the readers . </s>
And I think that , it led to a real disconnect between what institutions were producing and what readers wanted , and I saw this all the time when I was at those institutions , and when I was there three years ago at the Washington Post… and I include myself in that , I saw online , I saw the Web as a nuisance , I wanted to write front-page stories for a newspaper , despite the fact that I could look at the Web metrics and see that I was getting 10 or 20 times as many people reading my story online , that that’s where people wanted the news . And I think that creates a culture that I don’t think works for the modern news consumer . And what new media’s done is it’s ripped down that wall , between the institution and the reader , and it’s opened up , I think it’s made it more transparent and it’s allowed you the reader to participate more in what we’re doing and even some of you to participate in the journalism that we’re doing . I also want to clear up some of the myths about new media , because I think all the things that Phil said are really important and I think…you always have to remember that new media is in its infancy and that , it’s going to grow and it’s going to mature . </s>
And you’re going to hear stuff tonight about how there’s a demise of serious journalism , that you know , that if you look online , if you look at new media it’s just not as serious and substantive . I’ve been in Washington for 15 years , and I would say that the coverage of the health care debate , has been the most substantive , the deepest coverage , the most accountable coverage that I’ve seen of a domestic policy issue in some time . And the best of it is coming not from the mainstream media , but from outside of the mainstream media . Whether it’s Jonathan Cohn from The New Republic or Ezra Klein who’s doing his stuff sort of deep down in the WashingtonPost.com , whether it’s Politico where we have three or four reporters just doing the policy element , we have investigative reporters doing the accountability element . </s>
Huffington Post often has their reporters dispatched to this issue . Dedicates a lot of its home page to this issue . You have Propublica , a not-for-profit organization run by Paul Steiger who I used to work with at the Wall Street Journal , and the Center for Public Integrity , doing some accountability reporting and making that available to readers throughout the country . You have the Kaiser Foundation…which has stepped in and has started to produce non-partisan news about the health care debate , a lot of it about the human element of it , they have 20 reporters , that stuff’s available to any newspaper that wants to run it , so for people who care , there’s more information than ever , and it’s coming mostly from new media . You’re also going to hear about the demise of foreign coverage . </s>
And I think that’s a serious problem . But we didn’t start this fire . It was dying before new media ever came along , it’s really expensive to do foreign coverage . And guess who is actually creating that bridge until we can figure out how to finance it . </s>
It’s new media . It’s Global Post which was started by some folks over at the Boston Globe . They have 65 reporters around the country that are doing work on a freelance basis in every corner of the country . During the aftermath of the Iranian debate which was mentioned in Phil’s column , or in Phil’s comments . </s>
The best coverage was often online , Huffington Post took the above-the-fold part of its home page , and the Huffington Post gets more traffic now than the Washington Post , and dedicated it to a running blog where you had video and text and audio coming in from Iran , so you could have a peek into what was happening on the streets that you never could’ve had in the old days , and I think that is a good thing . Andrew Sullivan was doing a similar thing on his blog . </s>
He had 1.2 million visitors in one day , which is more than you would get people reading a newspaper , all but the top three newspapers that are out there . David Wood , who is married to someone that works at Politico -- he was a foreign policy reporter covering Afghanistan on the ground . </s>
Got laid off because of cutbacks at mainstream media . Who hired him ? It’s American Online Politics Daily . It’s new media that’s giving these people a chance to do journalism . And I do believe that as new media matures , we’re going to take over that social responsibility of funding the expensive to do journalism , like accountability and like foreign policy reporting because you can’t cover anything if you’re not in business . </s>
And I think that it’s new media that’s going to crack the code on the business models that actually work . You’re also going to hear from that side on the demise of accountability and investigative reporting . I think new media is leading the charge and they’re leading it by keeping all the mainstream media reporters employed . A lot of the best people in the business -- Bill Hamilton was Bob Woodward’s editor at the Washington Post , one of the best editors in Washington -- we , he just came over to Politico to help do our investigative stories and our longer form stories . Huffington Post started the Investigative Fund , which is a not-for-profit arm that does investigative reporting . </s>
It’s going to be run by Larry Roberts , who is running investigations for the Washington Post . Propublica , which I mentioned a little bit earlier , has thirty-three reporters , including Jeff Gerth from the New York Times , and many other people have been doing investigative reporting for a long time . I mentioned Talking Points Memo , and Phil was saying , Well , can they make money ? Is there an ability for them to finance the type of journalism that takes on government ? </s>
Well , I think so . They just got another round of funding . They’re doubling the size of their staff . They’re starting a Washington bureau and they’re predicting that they can get to a path to profitability . </s>
And I believe that because Politico’s done it . In year three , with a hundred and twenty employees , doing that type of journalism , we’re profitable . And I think it proves that this works . So I urge all of you to vote for the , the resolution because new media has given journalism the tools , the tricks , the metabolism and the journalists to succeed . </s>
Thank you . A reminder of where we are . We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I’m John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We have six debaters on the stage here , two teams of three . And they are arguing over this motion : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media . You have heard three opening statements and now on to the fourth . I’d like to welcome Katrina vanden Heuvel , who is editor of The Nation -- a small magazine with a fiercely loyal following , in many ways a targeted elite readership that would be the envy of many online websites . </s>
However , The Nation is how old ? </s>
A hundred and forty-four , and I feel it every day . Ladies and gentlemen , Katrina vanden -- So you look real young . You not only look young , but you look fabulous . </s>
Okay . I -- Ah heh . I never imagined that as editor and publisher of The Nation I’d be standing here against the resolution : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media . For a hundred and forty- four years The Nation has challenged the limits , exposed the flaws of what we call the MSN . Let me quote an old media guy , Antonio Gramsci : We are witnesses to the old media order dying . </s>
But a new one is not yet born . And Jim VandeHei can talk about all of those examples . But Propublica , for example , is very keen and explicit about partnering with what might be called legacy old media publications to get the big bang they want for their stories -- the New York Times , the Washington Post . Michael Wolff , Newser basically lives off of aggregating mainstream media sites . So I think to say , Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media may get the testosterone flowing up here , but it distracts from the tough work of salvaging and reviving quality journalism in newsrooms that will hold accountable the powerful . </s>
So I’m ready to separate my frustration with the many weaknesses of the mainstream media from a recognition of the valuable role it plays . And I would , you know , suggest to anyone to go back and look , not just twenty years ago , but at the last two years of the Pulitzer prizes or the Hellman Media Award , which I am on , and look at who is winning awards to reform , correct , shame , expose -- and it’s still largely the mainstream media . </s>
I’m not going to speak in ways I was going to about my frustration with the mainstream media . </s>
You can imagine it , from the run-up to last year’s financial meltdown and most centrally , the Iraq war . </s>
So many mainstream media outlets have operated as stenographers to power , not as tough , hardheaded reporters . And this is a real problem , but this is not about throwing out the baby with the bath water . It’s not defending the indefensible . It is about talking about , yes , the capacity of institutions for the health of our democracy . And for someone to say , Oh , it’s just the commonweal and you’re going to hear about people who want to protect the health of our democracy , I consider quality , independent reporting a public good . </s>
And for all the frustration the mainstream media has caused us , we can’t live without it until we have some idea of what’s going to replace it . And I would argue right now , nobody has a clear idea . </s>
The fact is that nobody but institutions like the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Wall Street Journal , excluding the nutty editorial pages , and a small group of regional papers do most of the reporting in this country that the rest of us depend on to try to hold power accountable . And yeah , there are mistakes . But it’s the hardworking reporter , whether in Congress , the federal bureaucracy . You talked about Ezra Klein , Jim . </s>
Fair enough , he’s done some great work on the health care . He’s at the Washington Post . State houses , City Hall are on the warfronts , which , you know , unfortunately , we’re in a number of them . That is the expensive legwork , drudge work that allows our system to operate with even a dose of accountability . </s>
And that is expensive . So , for all their flaws , think about what newspapers -- and not just newspapers -- have done to provide a check on corruption and crooked politicians . Think about not only what my partner , Phil , spoke about -- journalists as not only witnesses to history but witnesses to oppression , journalistic enterprises keeping people safe , the most vulnerable from torture , oppression , injustice . </s>
People do awful things to each other but it’s worse in places where everybody is kept in the dark . Twitter isn’t going to feed that right now . It is building their other sources -- Global Post , one of the better for-profit models . But the capacity is not there yet . </s>
At the local level there are reports which correlate a measurable decline in the quality of local democracy with the demise of local papers . So if the current journalistic model is unsustainable -- and you may think it is -- it’s up to those in our society who care about the continued ability to function as a democracy to find ways to fund reporting and insure the dissemination of quality journalism and information . This is a transformational moment . You’re going to hear from the other side . In crisis is opportunity . </s>
But it’s not a moment to toss out what has value , despite the flaws . There is a journalistic eco-system emerging out there but it is still very fragile . And to make the divide between old and new media into something , I would argue , artificially inflated by the other side , is to pit against each other what should be evolving together for the benefit of our country . </s>
So the fundamental problem remains . Without powerful media institutions to take on the powerful on behalf of the rest of us we become more vulnerable as a society to those who would use their influence for private gain , damn the public consequences . We need a plan B and we don’t have one yet -- which , come to think of it , reminds me of how the Bush Administration went into Iraq and we all know how that turned out . </s>
Thank you . Our next debater , who will be speaking for the motion : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media , John Hockenberry , has been , I would say , an old colleague of mine who has dabbled in the mainstream media , working at both NBC and ABC . </s>
But his career has really been built around experimentation . I wager he is the only person in the hall who has written , produced and acted in a one-man show off-Broadway . He’s been breaking the rules a long time . He is currently the host of public radio morning news program , The Takeaway . Ladies and gentlemen , John Hockenberry . </s>
Thank you . And thank you , Katrina . I would say that new media has a lot to learn from The Nation , which most these days resembles a blog , more than anything else in the mainstream media . </s>
And I think we owe The Nation a debt . </s>
But speaking directly to people is nothing new . And the idea that our opponents would have us believe that somehow freedom of the press and the accountability of the media to hold institutions accountable and to keep them honest -- is somehow created by this for-profit structure that my colleague Michael describes compellingly is dead and that my colleague Jim describes is alive and well , at least in terms of its voice and its passion for accountability in the new media is at odds with what the Constitution is about . The first amendment enabled the mainstream media and what have they done with the custodianship of this authority and this sense of holding us all accountable in this democracy and in doing the quality reporting that we so value ? What have they done ? What are we defending here ? </s>
In September , The Beatles Rock Band Project was , a product , was unveiled . And it was extraordinarily successful and it was a profound argument to those in the corporate for-profit media in the music business that said somehow the means of distribution being freed from the record companies to people who actually play and use music was going to destroy music in some sense : that if the record business went away somehow music would be affected , that somehow the art form of music and the quality of music would be affected . What instead happened was people bought Beatles Rock Band because they wanted the music . </s>
They also wanted the experience of being in the band . </s>
They wanted to part of the music itself . The technology enabled people suddenly to be a part of something that they were not permitted to be a part of . </s>
Why ? Because the for-profit structure of mainstream media prevented them . It’s an old story in America . When the means of distribution goes out of the hands of the small set of individuals and individual institutions that control it , change is afoot . </s>
This is a moment we should embrace . All of the institutions described by our opponents were created in times of similar transformation . </s>
The Hearst era , the New York Times , the tabloid era in American history which formed the basis of the American Revolution were all transformational moments when mainstream media was going away and new media was coming in . This is a moment to celebrate . Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media -- it should be written in the Constitution . What are they trying to preserve here ? John Donvan says that I dabbled in the mainstream media . </s>
No , no , no -- I was handcuffed to the wall of the mainstream media , ladies and gentlemen . </s>
Are we preserving the office culture and mentality at a television network where the senior editor of a news program holds an office poll to bet on the ratings for next morning’s program -- that culture ? </s>
The obsession with the ages of the audience , as many jokes have been made here tonight -- this is something for the mainstream media . Chasing eyeballs , commodifying eyeballs -- that’s the business . </s>
At the height of the war in Iraq , that Katrina suggests President Bush led us into , the number one news broadcast reporting on that war was owned by a defense contractor . </s>
Is that what we’re preserving here ? </s>
Is there not a conflict of interest in that situation ? Do we want to perpetuate that ? Are we saying that the mainstream media , which has so humored these wonderful journalists who get paid not as much as the executives at the for-profit media , but we want to have them around because they hold the media accountable . </s>
They hold the government accountable . </s>
This is a disservice , number one , to the first amendment . It’s a disservice to journalism . </s>
My first job as a journalist was a volunteer . Now , I’m not saying that I would give up all of my income at this stage in my life , but the best journalists are people who don’t do it for the money . We want to create institutions that are all about doing it for the money and then we expect that the values of journalism and reporting are going to be maintained in that structure ? </s>
And then when it changes and institutions like my colleague Jim describes , Politico.com -- where that I will do journalism whether I’m paid or not kind of passion comes into play -- we’re going to say , Oh , my gosh , what’s happening ? We’re throwing out the baby with the bath water . There’s something wrong here . We’ve got ta stop this . </s>
No , this is how it works . We do not look to the mainstream media to preserve the first amendment . We look to the first amendment to preserve the voices of the people -- on Twitter who are holding the people accountable : on Facebook , on social media , in blogs - - who are creating media and publishing media on their own . When the means of distribution leaves the hands of the few the many benefit . </s>
Now , are we to judge the success of this transformation by who is making money or not ? </s>
Is that consistent with the values of we want to hold the government accountable ? We want journalism to be the Fifth Estate . This is the mechanisms of democracy . If our gauge for the health of the media is whether some folks are making money then we’ve given up at the beginning . We basically conceded the debate and I won’t concede the debate . </s>
Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media . They had custodianship of this sense of authority for quite a while . And what did they bring us ? </s>
Two words : balloon boy . Iraq . Finally , to debate against the motion : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media -- David Carr , who is a media columnist and reporter for the New York Times and also frequently capable of getting off a good line or two . </s>
His take on the situation we’re in now , a column from last September , he said : Clearly , for the mainstream media the sky is falling . The question is whether anyone will be left to cover it . Ladies and gentlemen , David Carr . Thank you , John . </s>
Thank you , John Hockenberry . I’ve had time to sit there for a little bit and really do some study on the audience and I want to co-sign , young , good looking , fabulous and I’m thinking , hot . It just came to me while I was looking . Do I mention that because I want you to vote against this proposition , which is a per se dumb idea ? Why ? Number one : I should mention it’s how I get hamburgers for my family so there is a small bit of self-interest . </s>
But number two : these are really smart lawyers over here , but we got good facts . And the fact is , as opposed to what ? </s>
You want us to take the weight off Balloon Boy . Balloon Boy was a trending topic on Twitter for four days straight . It’s all Twitter could talk about . They weren’t talking about the elections in Iraq , the elections in Afghanistan that have gone wrong . They weren’t talking about the bombings in Iraq . </s>
They were talking about John and Kate . Twitter , I love Twitter . I’m on there every damn day . But , but the best links in Twitter are always , always into the data stream of mainstream media . </s>
Because I work at the New York Times I’m cast here as the dad in the basement at the teen party . Cool guys over there , but us old fuddy-duddies . </s>
Well , I work at the New York Times . We have seventeen million people that come to our website . We put out a hundred videos every month . </s>
We have eighty blogs . We are fully engaged in the revolution that John talks about and we are at the vanguard , as is the Washington Post , as is the Wall Street Journal . To suggest that somehow , a hand created citizen media is going to support -- for instance , the New York Times has a news budget of two hundred and twenty million dollars , dozens of bureaus all over the world , many other news organizations , the same footprint . And we’re going to toss that out , which is the proposition -- toss that out and kick back and see what Facebook turns up . </s>
I don’t think so . Look , we’re gathered here around a bonfire and I stipulate to the business problems of the media . Larger national newspapers , some of them are doing pretty well . </s>
Small community papers are doing great . Michael wants you to think that it’s five large media companies . It’s hundreds and hundreds of newspapers , local stations representing thousands and thousands of reporters who are bringing accountability to their community every day . I live in New Jersey , which is a petri dish , a game preserve of corruption . </s>
The last time that they came out to get the bad guys in government it took three busses . Do we need fewer reporters ? Do we need less accountability ? The next time they’re going to need a choo-choo train , to . </s>
There is , there is a delight in dancing around the bonfire , there’s a delight , in grave-dancing , I’m not a grave-dancer , you shouldn’t be either , you should vote against this proposition . The hybrid model that Katrina talked about , where old and new media gradually developed ways of dealing with the business challenges of supporting independent accountability reporting , is what’s real . That’s what is true . It feels great to throw out the babies and stare into the bathwater so let’s go ahead and throw out a few . </s>
Okay , there goes Glenn Beck… There goes Keith Olbermann . It felt great . They’re gone . And it’s true that newspapers and broadcasters have used their monopoly powers to make millions but they’ve funded reporting over and above what the culture ever had . Michael suggested the business is only 20 years old . </s>
Paper I work at has been around for 150 years… I think that part of the reason that people get riled up is it’s easy to dwell on the barnacles , but what would you really know about Walter Reade , what would you really know about Katrina , what would you really know about 9/11 . A million bloggers , typing a billion posts , I don’t think could get you to the place you need to be as a citizen to make important decisions , I consume new media , I believe in new media , I love Politico , it’s a great brand build-up . </s>
But unless you got a millionaire that’s going to absorb a lotta losses to get things going— The shop I work for occasionally makes money . None of those guys can say that . Okay . The model that they’re selling you has not demonstrated a business efficacy . </s>
And so , when Jim himself described it as an industry that’s in its infancy , are we to take the old , and throw it away , and grab a nascent industry that’s done a world of good , but in very small numbers . Global Post which has been brought up . They’re paying reporters hundreds of dollars , who are there because legacy media assets put them out there , to train them out there . </s>
All of these new media enterprises , many of them , are staffed with legacy assets from old media and once those assets peter out they’re going to have to figure out a way to make money . I mean , I get it , I’m here from the New York Times and I’ve received my orders from the dark overlords of the mainstream media . </s>
They put a chip in , I got ta tell you it hurts a little bit . And they also told me , if you fail tonight , do not come back to headquarters . So keep that in mind . </s>
Look— It’s fun to build a bonfire , it’s not much fun to figure out what you’re going to replace it with . All the plucky citizens in the world , all the networked intelligence that you can come up with , are not going to give us what we need . Which is real-time data as citizens on a variety of platforms from a variety of voices , to make an informed choice every time we step outside that door . Vote against this proposal . </s>
And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared debate where the motion is , “Good riddance to the mainstream media.” And I’ve now received the results of the preliminary vote , just to remind you and to remind listeners and viewers , our live audience voted before the debate began , their positions on our motion , “Good riddance to the mainstream media.” </s>
They will vote again at the end of the debate and the team that changes the most minds over the course of the debate will be declared our winner . </s>
Here are the preliminary results . Before the debate 25 percent were for the motion , 50 percent against the motion , and 25 percent undecided . That is where things started , you will vote again at the conclusion to pick our winner . Now we’re—now we’re moving on to Round 2 , this is our middle round in which the debaters address each other directly , and we will also take questions from you in the audience . And as you ponder your questions I’ll once again ask you to think in terms of real questions and to think in terms of something that’s very brief , and if you have to write it on a piece of paper it’s probably not what you want to do . </s>
Something that is spontaneous , fresh , and real , will always work best . But I would like to ask a question of the side that is arguing against the motion , Katrina , you said that there is no Plan B , but what I heard from the other side sounded like , Plan C , D , E , F , G , all the way through Z , what— why do you feel that the argument particularly that Jim VandeHei made that there are plenty of already evident… forms of real , legitimate replacement , good journalism happening , why don’t you take those seriously as actually stepping up and filling the gap that you say is absent without a Plan B . You know , I spent the last year or so going to many conferences about the future of journalism , the crisis of journalism , just last week there was a big report on the reconstruction of American journalism , I’ve read all of Michael Massing’s pieces in the New York Review of Books . </s>
There are many models . There are many models , and I think—believe I was arguing for a hybrid . I don’t think we throw out what has strong elements , that have worked , for—I want to pick up on John Hockenberry’s points , about NBC owning a defense contractor , one of the first centerfolds , the only…first centerfold The Nation ever did was on the national entertainment state in 1996 where we tracked five octopi . And the news operations were little cogs in these enterprises . </s>
And many of these are newspapers but there are strong MSM operations , which have a capacity , which Phil spoke to for example , on access , Freedom of Information . On sending journalists around the world , sending journalists around this country , and funding them . </s>
Nonprofit funding of journalism was about $ 128 million between 2005 into 2009 . </s>
That’s one major newsroom . Their for-profit models are very small at the moment , and I think all of these foundations and all of the people looking at new models , want to build on elements of the MSM , I spoke of ProPublica . A group in Washington founded by David Bennahum . The Independent . </s>
He monitors the impact of his website , by how his stories , his reporters get picked up in the mainstream media— Go to Michael Wolff , what do you make of that , it’s basically an argument that somebody will step up and reach into his own pockets and pay for it . Katrina . You reach into your pocket , you pay for The Nation . And— </s>
I thought you were talking about Rupert for a moment , Michael— And , and this is— Well , Rupert— In fact that’s , in fact— —Rupert—Rupert— —if I could interrupt , that’s not fair— </s>
—reaches into many , many pockets to do— The Nation has a circle— </s>
But Katrina , let him— </s>
No , could I just say we are— —Katrina , Katrina— </s>
—the old model , reader-supported— Katrina , please let him speak . Well , but you’re supported by a foundation , I don’t know about what—how much comes from your pocket or your family’s pocket but you’re really not talking about the media business , you’re not talking about journalism , you’re talking about a philanthropy , which is great , and that’s another conversation that we might have , but if you’re talking about a robust , self- supporting , profit-making , entrepreneurial , live , real , continuing reason for being business , that’s something different . Now in your—everything you’ve said is incredibly noble , and it’s good , I wish it would happen , but it’s not the media business . And maybe you’re not a part of the media business which I would argue that you’re not . </s>
That you do something else . </s>
But the proposition is about the media business . It’s the mainstream media is actually at various times , it’s been the biggest business in this country . </s>
And you’re talking about something that is you know , worthy but not really , the discussion— </s>
Phil Bronstein I see getting ready to respond ? </s>
Well first of all I mean I think that it’s really , the issue is not…what do we think of Plans B through Z . I think we might all agree that there are interesting plans in there somewhere in that alphabet soup . </s>
The proposition here is getting rid of A . Not the plans B through Z . And I think John Hockenberry created a bit of a false case , money case . The issue really isn’t about , are these capitalist organizations . </s>
Evil capitalist organizations . They must make money and they go against the grain of the great passion of journalism . Believe me , to be at a newspaper these days you have to be passionate because , you’re like the guy in the L’il Abner cartoon with the cloud over his head all the time . The point I tried to—I wanted to make about money was , that you needed to be able to sustain that kinda journalism , Propublica has a three-year , $ 10 million-a-year grant essentially from a single family . </s>
Is that going to continue ? What happens if Propublica writes about that family— </s>
But Phil , Phil , John’s argument— Look , wait , wait a minute— —John also made the argument— —here , here’s the problem , here’s the problem with that . I mean , okay , there’s a lot of moaning and handwringing about what’s going away and it—that somehow new media is ending the old media , well no , we’re in a transformational moment , things are ending and other things are beginning . </s>
Where you don’t go , and this is surprising to me . Are you arguing for an explicit protected subsidy of these media divisions , of these news divisions of these organizations where , somehow in the federal tax code they’re going to be permitted some status , some subsidy that’s going to allow them to survive because we’ve decided , that it’s constitutionally important to maintain these businesses ? You don’t argue that— </s>
— You don’t argue that . David Carr— </s>
You say we can’t let it go away— David Carr— But—but John , do you disagree then with George Washington who did subsidize the distribution of newspapers , the founding fathers were very explicit , that the government had a role— </s>
Then why didn’t you argue that there— </s>
—in regulatory policy , tax policy— </s>
But George Washington was on your side . I’m sorry— Why didn’t—why didn’t you argue that up there if George Washington was on your side ? </s>
because it’s a young crowd— </s>
That’s not what you said . Geor—I’m talking about— I think this debate should not be about business models , it should be about , how do we salvage and revive— But , but— —using elements of the mainstream media— </s>
—but Katrina , it could only be not about business models— Quality of journalism— </s>
—because you’re not— </s>
Excuse me— —you’re not in a business . I am in the business , Michael— Well , this is , if you— </s>
Michael , Michael and Katrina— </s>
If you don’t think I’m in the business— </s>
Michael—Mic—Katrina and Michael— I need you to alternate . So— I’ll be directing traffic for the next minute . </s>
Michael . </s>
Make your point again because I don’t think you could be heard . And then Katrina , you’ll come back . Well , the , Katrina’s point is to remove this from a business discussion . In other words , and let’s be clear about what she’s saying , she’s saying , this is about journalists , this is about what journalists want . </s>
This is live having the health care debate decided just by doctors . It’s not true . I mean it doesn’t work that way . </s>
Nothing works this way , except if you want to just sequester something and make it part of— I don’t know , maybe a university— Okay , Katrina , come back to this— You know , you know , let me jump in— </s>
David , David , just a second , I gave—told Katrina she would get next to— She gave—she gave— </s>
I gave him my proxy— Then—then David Carr , it’s yours . The—let’s take these hardcore business guys at their word , over here , okay— Public radio , David . </s>
The , — The… Let’s just think about what they’re doing , Katrina is apparently guilty of running a magazine that doesn’t make money . </s>
Newser is an interesting model which involves either imitation or theft of other material depending on which— Politico— Or abbreviation of stuff , of David Carr stories which are vastly too long , who’s the last— Okay— —who read a full David Carr— </s>
Good one . Good one , have any of you— Back to you , David Carr . Have any of you ever read Michael in Vanity Fair ? </s>
No… </s>
I… Every word— I take that— </s>
—a shining diamond , anyways— These guys…these guys are saying , your business is over , we’re the new crowd . </s>
Their models are completely and totally untested , with the exception of John , public radio has been an amazing model that’s produced an enormous amount of journalism . But it’s not a for-profit model— If our models are— Michael— </s>
Can new media fact-check mainstream media for a second , because there are profitable models , Politico in its third year , 120 employees— What about the money— —come on David , David— </s>
—that went in . David— profitable . Doing serious nonpartisan journalism . </s>
The Huffington Post which you can argue is partially aggregator , is not profitable now but if you look at its traffic which this month surpassed the Washington Post , if they weren’t in a heavy investment mode , could probably be profitable . What you’re also forgetting to know , to note , is that it’s early , we’re all trying to figure out the business model , we haven’t even started to charge for content . Trust me , people , you’re going to be paying for content , a lot of it is going to be new media content , and I think the whole argument over here is , we’re not saying get rid of mainstream media altogether , we’re saying , get rid of it , get rid of it the way you’ve been ! </s>
The reason you guys are arguing that you survive or that people should vote with you is that by adopting all of our techniques , by get—the speed , the transparency , the openness , the Twitter , all of the things that are thriving in new media , that’s—we’re equipping some of the mainstream media institutions , to have at least a chance of survival and there aren’t that many— </s>
Jim , do you think they’re on your side without knowing it ? Pardon , I think they are , I do think they’re on our side without knowing it . And I think they would privately concede that they’re on our side . But I can’t tell the difference— </s>
John Hockenberry— —between…I can’t tell the difference between , are you arguing that your institution should be maintained as they are now , or are you simply saying , I want to know I have a job when the New York Times goes under . I mean is that the argument . </s>
Because the latter one I’m not interested in . The former one I am interested in , of course there are things about the New York Times , and there are qualities of the mainstream media that we want preserved . They aren’t the core of those businesses— Well , the— —and the strategy for making those businesses profitable is not to do more of that , as we’ve amply demonstrated , they do less of that now— </s>
But we do want some of the qualities preserved , and that is why we are against “Good riddance to the mainstream”— Yeah , “good riddance” is not— Luckily they are—they have been preserved , there’s a lot of new media institutions that have the same values of fairness , of— same values of accountability . And thank God for it— But you’re— MAN —and that’s where the growth is— </s>
There are old mainstream organizations— MAN That’s where the innovation is— the innovation in the industry is coming— Let me address— MAN —from new media , the innovation about business models , about the type of journalism , about the ways that we can use technology to make journalism a lot more accessible to all of you , to give all of you guys input into—to journalism , and I think it’s a much better thing , like I hate the pessimism that I see , in the mainstream media about what’s happening , this is a great time , it’s a great time if you want to be a journalist , it’s a great time if you’re a news consumer , because there’s more information than you could’ve ever asked for , and a lot of it is coming from where ? From us , not from them— </s>
Phil Bronstein . Let me just say here is how— John , John , John , let me just get to the other side , Phil Bronstein , please . </s>
Well I hate the pessimism too . </s>
But John Hockenberry , John made a very eloquent case about the First Amendment a few minutes ago , and he and I were together earlier today and I mentioned the Balco case , or , the problems that came up in the Balco case with the government , and he said well , at least we have the First Amendment , or we have the First Amendment , something to that effect . And the reality is the First Amendment did not help us when Alberto Gonzalez was the Attorney General . The First Amendment did not help us as that administration , the previous administration went Circuit Court by Federal Circuit Court , to take away the rights of reporters to maintain the confidentiality of their sources and do their job . The First Amendment didn’t mean anything in that circumstance . </s>
And so , we’re all great believers in the First Amendment , I would assume . But it really required years of hard work , years of struggle , and millions and millions of dollars , for newspapers whether it’s the San Francisco Chronicle or the New York Times or the Washington Post , or the Riverside Press Enterprise , to make sure that the government was held accountable , to the notion of the First Amendment , that there was a First Amendment and that there would be people fighting for it . So , I think that was a false sort of argument to make about the First Amendment , I think the argument is very different— </s>
John Hockenberry , you want to come back on this— Sadly you used the worst case for endorsing the mainstream media . The war was endorsed by the mainstream media in the United States , the war in Iraq was the worst moment of the mainstream media in the United States , similar to the— </s>
— Alberto Gonzales period . These were aspects of the Bush administration that were not questioned by the mainstream media , it was only much , much later , that the media stepped in and questioned those points . Alberto Gonzalez— </s>
And indeed— </s>
—— —the mainstream media apologized for its endorsement of both the war and some of the tactics of the Bush administration , long after the fact . The idea that you were on the front lines of being accountable to the government run amok under the Bush administration , is just completely at odds with the facts— So to maintain mainstream media you would like us to be perfect . No , no , no , I’m not saying that , I’m just saying— </s>
You’re saying we have flaws and we’ve agreed we have flaws— —you’re picking the wrong period of time to win a trophy for . We—you’re saying we have flaws , we agree we have flaws— What would you know about the conduct of the war in Afghanistan right now , you as citizens , you as a broadcaster , absent mainstream reporting . Who has boots on the ground— </s>
David , David , the prob— What—just say— You’re absolutely right— —what is Twitter , going to tell you about what’s going on in Afghanistan . Michael Wolff— </s>
We—yeah , no—David , I think the better question is , don’t we feel that we don’t know what’s going on in Afghanistan , this war has been going on for— Jesus Christ . And suddenly , suddenly , suddenly we wake up and we find , oh my God , we’re losing the war ! Where has the New York Times been— </s>
How did you know that— —the New York Times has not told me , we’re losing the war… Jesus Christ , David , that is the worst excuse , it’s Afghanistan— </s>
I— —where we are dying . </s>
Afghanistan , we have had people there doing rigorous reporting that— Oh yeah , really rigorous— But Michael , I mean— </s>
—you know— —I can’t— </s>
Jesus— I can’t believe— </s>
—this is appalling— —I’m going to defend the New York Times but let me do that on this case because I do think , the reporting around the corruption of the Karzai government and the run-off , contributed in some measure to a public waking up and the fact that a majority of Americans now oppose this war , and if I could , in between…the Iraq war and Afghanistan , or at a certain point around Iraq , how would we have learned about the torture sites , the black sites , rendition , Abu Ghraib… Yeah , we— Those were the— </s>
We’re not saying— —those were the strong elements— </s>
—— —of reporting— There are some— —in the mainstream . Yeah , there are stories here . </s>
But this is— actually maybe one of the things I’m , I do this a lot , I go around the country and I talk about the end of newspapers and one of the things that invariably comes up , let’s see if it comes up here is the Boston Globe and its investigation of abuses in the Catholic church , and everybody goes well , what would happen with that . And I thought about this for a long time and I—then I thought…well , where was the Boston Globe for the 30 years this was going on ? And , this is one of those things , yes , we know . </s>
But we know too late , nobody , nobody should get an award here . This is not , this is not what—you shouldn’t say , oh , we’re really proud of our coverage in Iraq and Afghanistan . My God , it’s a dollar late , whatever that— So Michael , that’s your view of the Boston Globe— That’s your view of the Boston Globe coverage of pederasty in the Catholic church is that , it was useless because it was late ? Well , for God’s sake , yes , you can’t always defend yourself like this— </s>
Michael , are you serious , you’re saying yes , that it’s better—not better late than never ? </s>
No , I’m saying you did your job poorly , we did our jobs poorly— But the job , the job— </s>
—that’s the job that should—no , you can’t do that , you can’t say , oh yes , well we came in finally , we got it in the end . We got it , 30 years it took us to get it— But I think their argument is that nobody else did , ever— </s>
Yeah , yeah— —until they came in . Wait , wait , wait , wait— no . </s>
They are missing the point . Nobody else did because , in this case the Boston Globe was in the pocket of the archdiocese , they stood right in the way of that story . </s>
They blocked that story . Those are the guys who should go to jail . David Carr— Big powerful institutions in government , in business , need big , powerful institutions in opposition of them , Exxon… big tobacco , Exxon , the current White House , the last White House . </s>
How would you know that we’re using remote robotic airplanes in a systematic way , to go into Pakistan right now , with the CIA’s finger on the trigger— Okay , David , we get the point of your question and it’s a good one— Yeah— — </s>
—let’s let take—John Hockenberry take that— Look , we are off the proposition . Totally off the proposition . </s>
There would be total agreement on this stage…possibly not with Michael . But— If the proposition was , “Good riddance to journalism.” No one is saying that . I would not participate on a panel that said “Good riddance to journalism.” Oh yeah , I would . </s>
The main—right , there we go . I know my colleagues . What we are talking about is good riddance to a business model , that has a mixed record on the kinds of virtues that David Carr is talking about . That is now going down the tubes for reasons that have to do with an economic transformation that is both productive and useful , and the idea of the baby being thrown out with the bathwater , that there is no alternative , Jim amply demonstrates that the alternative is emerging . </s>
If it’s with partnerships with the mainstream media so be it , but it is a good thing , vote with the proposition . </s>
I want to— — </s>
—go to the audience for some questions now , and what we’re going to do is bring up the lights , and…microphones will travel , and I’m shading my eyes because I still can’t quite see . There’s a woman in the seventh row up with your hand up , if you put two hands up everybody—I know it’s an odd thing to do but , now they can find you . </s>
And we want to ask anybody who is a member of the media or a blogger , to identify them—so let’s say if you’re an A-list blogger , to identify yourselves , so you— You can self-select on that one . Ma’am , your question , please . And , question rules . Yes , of course , thank you , I do work for a public radio station in Washington D.C . I cut my teeth on investigative journalism . </s>
I’m not quite so sure I really care about the delivery system , whether it’s a blog , a newspaper , a television story . Of all the models we’ve talked about tonight , I’d like to hear the panelists debate the best delivery system for really deep investigative journalism , I think of everything that’s really missing in our media today . All right , and Phil Bronstein has argued that it takes very deep pockets , John Hockenberry , to do exactly what that questioner is asking about , the very deep kind of journalism . And you actually argued the opposite , that having deep pockets leads to terrible conflicts of interest . Take that question . </s>
Well I would say that the deep pockets that supported one investigative series , which I applaud , was also used for other purposes , for the other 364 days of the year , so , the deep pockets are used for various things at various times . You—if you exist under the illusion that the deep pockets merely support investigative journalism , then you’re really supporting our point here . Obviously we support and endorse the virtues of investigative journalism that holds institutions to account . </s>
But to say that the only delivery system for that is newspapers financed by shareholders in a corporate model , is to really ignore the present moment . I think newspapers do a great job . I think Politico.com does a great job . I think any one individual platform is not the model . </s>
And I think what we’re talking about here is a proliferation of platforms being a good thing , a transformational moment . And if it makes some very , very well- paid people in the mainstream media worried , then , you know , that’s the kind of worry that we journalists cut our teeth on it seems to me . Phil Bronstein ? </s>
Yeah , and we’ve heard a lot from our opponents tonight about , “You will hear from the other side , ” and we really , you haven’t heard a lotta those things that they say you’ll hear from us . And I mean first of all , John Hockenberry just said a minute ago , if we could roll back the tape -- I’d suggest we do it . If it’s in partnership with mainstream media , so be it , meaning the future . Well , there goes their side of the argument . Because , if mainstream media is good riddanced , then there’s no partnership with mainstream media to be had . </s>
I don’t know what the other purposes John was talking about , the 364 days a year , it sounds like , you know , we’re cutting people’s shoes off those other…the rest of the year . But I don’t believe , I mean —the quote when I went up to the podium was , you know , you said to your newsroom , the business model’s broken and no one knows how to fix it yet , so…I’m not making the case for the business model , and I am not making the case that that top- down , vertical kind of mass medium is really the only model . </s>
I don’t know that you’ve heard anyone from this side say it’s the only model which is the phrase that John just used . Gent— </s>
I would like to hear how your side is going to support yourself at some point . Gentleman in the fourth row ? We’re going to get VC’s just like you , Mike . </s>
No , I— All right— —will get VC’s , you won’t . Let’s respect our audience member . Sir . </s>
Thank you first of all to all the panelists , we’ve heard a lot about what is purportedly wrong with mainstream media . I’d like to hear a little bit about what might be wrong with new media , and also some comment on the recent calls from the regulators on regulating new media , bloggers and so forth disclosing what they receive from corporations , and how the new media , this nascent institution if you will , might evolve and what we need to watch out for if anything . </s>
That was a question . Yes . Katrina , would you like to take it ? I’m—yeah , you can— Uh… </s>
David Carr— Part of the problem that goes on on the Web , and there are so many wonderful examples of brand build-out on the Web , the Huffington Post , I’ve never encountered anything like it in my media career , watched something explode like that . Jim’s ability to take reporters who have worked elsewhere and just start breaking stories right away , has just been breathtaking to watch as a media reporter . That’s the exception , not the rule . Out on the Web , people assemble into verticals of self-interest . </s>
They often speak only to each other . </s>
They become an echo chamber of half-truths , sometimes outright lies , without any real data points coming in . And so you end up with a sort of mass of people talking to each other , no one has read anything . </s>
No one knows anything . </s>
They’re talking about something that someone else read that read that read that read . And we end up in a meta-world . </s>
The people that I follow on Twitter always include a link to what they’re talking about . </s>
The blogs that I follow , and Politico is a great example of this , live in the ecosystem of blogs , so you have transparency to what they’re talking and why they’re talking about it . You can look into the database . But there isn’t a lot of it going on . </s>
As these guys have said themselves , it’s a very nascent state . </s>
In the mainstream media , and the blogosphere , are—we’ve adopted the tools of the insurgency in terms of presentation , going to the Web , or Afghanistan reporting as video , as maps , where the drug lords are , blogs in real time of what’s going on . At the same time , you have new media adopting standards , reporting , approaches , starting to beef up . </s>
I think the two are coming together . Jim VandeHei , sounds like again you’re agreeing— Well we just—we keep hearing about that , you were just talking a little bit about the echo chamber like it’s just noise and people are amplifying positions that they already have and there’s a lot of misinformation out there . But who’s doing the fact-checking , some of the best fact-checking’s being done by new media . Factcheck.org , </s>
which I think is the name of the arm of the St. Petersburg Times which won a Pulitzer Prize for its fact- checking—that online , that new media component made the old media relevant , who’s been fact-checking , who was quickest to fact-check the death panels and all the other nonsense that we’ve had in different debates in recent months . It’s websites like ours , it’s the Huffington Post . It’s various bloggers who are checking this stuff in real time , and they’re setting the record straight , and I think that that’s a fabulous , advance . Is there a bigger burden on you as the reader right now than there was , 10 years ago , when five people at the three big networks and the two big newspapers told you how to view world events ? Yes . </s>
But I think there’s so much more information now for you to consume , thanks to new media , that you’re a much more educated consumer of news and you can make probably a much , a better decision based on the facts . Right , there was a second part to that question about regulation of the new media , and I’m sure you’re against it . So I’m going to— I mean I’m— </s>
—move on , to— I mean—yeah , I mean I’m against regulation and I’m against any , any government funding for , for journalists— Gentleman— —I think it needs to be— —— </s>
Needs to be attached to a robust business model . Jacket , tie , eyeglasses , and two hands up . </s>
Can’t use the two hands up trick everywhere . </s>
I’m the— Oh , I’m sorry , I actually was going to the gentleman behind you , and I’ll come back to you , ma’am . </s>
As a consumer I— Can you stand , please ? </s>
Yeah , as a consumer I think one of the values that I see in mainstream media is comprehension of coverage where you can look at a source , and really understand what’s going on in the world . And I worry that socially , how does media , if that goes away and there’s not funding for that breadth of coverage , what’s the social impact of that , if we all move to new media , certain verticals where people just choose…to read what they want to read and they’re not exposed to all these other things . </s>
John Hockenberry , why don’t you take that . Well , again , I think what is the argument there , do we preserve an institution and do we choose which newspapers are worthy of having this subsidy to maintain their position ? And then are we to call them independent ? </s>
Are we to say that because now they are supported by the government , they’re supported by some sort of tax on say , television or Internet service providers that that revenue now flowing to those institutions makes them secure and independent in some sense that’s going to make the journalism better ? No , I think what you’ve done there is create a jobs program for some great journalists and , let’s hope they stick around . But if they leave , there’s absolutely no guarantee that the virtues that you talk about that are associated with the brand of those institutions , is going to remain . What— the only thing— </s>
But John , do you—do you agree with the premise of the question that , that the new media tends toward people…seeking out views that they know they already agree with ? </s>
But I think the mainstream media is at least as guilty of that as anything in the blogsphere , I mean it is the Fox News Network I believe that created a theme park out of a conspiracy of liberals taking over the world . And— And so I think that model has worked for newspapers , as well as it’s worked for blogs , it’s certainly nothing that was invented by the Huffington Post . I’m just— Katrina— </s>
—I’m thinking of a news story in the Las Vegas Sun , which was a six-month project by a paper which wasn’t that well-funded but , part of the mainstream media , may have been a chain . And it was a journalist who covered what unaccountable officials had not covered , what the labor unions had averted their eyes to . And she uncovered…deaths . </s>
Accidental deaths of about 30 workers . </s>
And what she did with her reporting over a sustained period of time , and I think it would’ve been difficult to do though I’m all over many platforms , and I’m for hybrid . But people aren’t reading sustained , comprehensive series , on the Web , in a new media way . And what she did was save lives . </s>
And I think that is— But why couldn’t the Web very quickly adapt to that sort of model ? Well , I think , that , in a different instance— I mean again a sustained series over the course of a year , by Nina Bernstein of the New York Times , she not only had her newspaper behind her in filing FOIA’s which lawyers didn’t have the funding to do , this is on immigration detention . SoI think , she had the support of the funding , which is difficult in these untested models of new media… Even ProPublica as I said earlier , wants to get its stories in what you would consider the mainstream media , high- quality investigative journalism that exposes wrongs , corrects and reforms . I think the new media , and I don’t want to sound retro because I think we want a hybrid , we want a healthy journalism . </s>
But I think it’s tougher to do those kinds of things now , on the Web . </s>
People are doing Politico , they’re doing quick takes , they’re doing quick stories . But it’s rare to find people who are reading long investigative series… Okay , the questioner I asked— —on the Web— —to wait before , ma’am— ? </s>
—and it doesn’t have the impact in some way , I’m sorry , because of the institutional authority , historically , which may change and is changing slowly , but not yet , of a New York Times taking on a scandal , and pushing for reform which in my view is what public interest-watchdog-accountability journalism is about . Ma’am , your question . Yeah , I’m the general counsel of the Hearst Corporation and 20 minutes ago the Houston Chronicle sued the governor of Texas for failing to turn over a clemency report , which a source told us contained information that the person they killed today was innocent . My question to you all is , how many lawsuits are you aware of that , let’s call it new media , has brought on behalf of the public interest for important information . </s>
Jim VandeHei . We applaud what the Houston paper is doing , we applaud what the Las Vegas paper is doing , but I think when you decide that you’re going to vote for the proposition , one of the things you have to keep in mind is that it is a false argument to say that this can not and will not be done by the new media . </s>
You were talking about how you recall the— this Las Vegas series . </s>
I recall Talking Points Memo doing a series of pieces on the series of firings of US Attorneys under Bush and was relentless in doing it , and was—and did a great job of using the technology that new media’s created , to be able to get more documents , get more information and over time , build up a story that forced other people to reckon with and , and got attention and made a difference and I think increasingly— You used a lotta stories from local papers . Increasingly— And aggregators— </s>
And using a lot of like , the information that’s coming in — And you have files in your offices at the Chronicle as well , where you clip newspapers from other sources . And you use that as part of your research to develop stories , for heaven’s sakes— Right , but I wouldn’t then want to go kill those other sources . David Carr… David Carr . </s>
Right now in Chicago there’s something called the Innocence Project which is one of these hybrids of student journalists and a coach and they’ve got nearly a dozen people wrongly convicted , off of Death Row and helped the governor change the policy . This week , new case , prosecutors sensing an opportunity , doesn’t address the issue of whether the person they brought forth is guilty or innocent , says I want your notes . I want your emails . </s>
I want all of your reporting materials to prove , whether you got a better grade or not if you got this guy off . Again and again…you need large , powerful institutions , barnacles attached , to take on large , powerful government forces— Michael Wolff— —there’s no way around it . Michael Wolff . </s>
Just briefly and I think it’s worth pointing out and this is something that people up here are loath to say and people don’t like to say in a , you know , among a polite group here , but , and I like the people at the Hearst Company . </s>
But you put out terrible newspapers and you’ve put out terrible newspapers for at least half a century , so , the question is should we fight to preserve Hearst newspapers and again I love the people at Hearst and you put out some good magazines , et cetera , et cetera . But I don’t think anyone wants to make the case for Hearst newspapers— Ma’am , do you— </s>
—or for any— Do you— </s>
—of the chain newspapers— Do you feel , ma’am , that your question was answered ? No , I was looking for a numeric answer to the question— I’m sorry , repeat— I was looking for a numeric answer to the question , how many lawsuits have you brought in the public interest as part of original reporting , rather than the barnacle… pieces that you use , I’m not criticizing it but just curious as to whether or not you’ve put any energy into that . </s>
Look , we stipulate that new media does not have the track record that the New York Times or the Houston Chronicle has because it is new media . And , and indeed , if the metric is , what have you done for me over the last century , then new media will lose . But what we are talking about is , what have you done for me lately . And I think the question is that over time , mainstream media will have less ability to do what Katrina and David and Phil are talking about , and new media will have more capacity to do it , and the intent is absolutely there , and the panel has not demonstrated that , for some reason , new media has no interest in the kinds of things you’re talking about it , take Katrina’s thing for just one moment . </s>
She’s describing how a woman reporter worked for six months on a story that saved lives , and that’s getting more difficult now . </s>
I mean , imagine , at a small local paper in New Jersey , a reporter goes in to an editor and says , you know , I’ve been working for a month on this story but…it’s so difficult , I wish I was working for the New York Times . It would be so much easier if I was working for an organization with the deep pockets to support me , what would that editor say ? </s>
He would say go back and do your story . </s>
That’s how journalism works . The idea that this is tough , is not an argument , for them . The idea that it is tough , is an argument for all the journalists who will continue to keep working regardless of whether the New York Times or the Washington Post go away tomorrow or not . Yeah , but that’s not even what would happen , if I can argue with people on my own side—side . </s>
If they went in , if that person in New Jersey went in and said I’ve been working on this for a month and it’s really hard , what would the editor say , the editor would say forget it , okay , it’s over , done with , let’s get on to something else . But you know there are interesting models , again I go back to this reconstruction of American journalism , this is how I spend my evenings when I’m not watching Monty Python . But , I was— Eight newspapers in Ohio have come together , to continue the newsroom , the news reporting that that state needs . In New Jersey and New York there’s a tristate—I’m sorry , two-state collaboration , so that you can continue some of the reporting , these are mainstream media organizations— </s>
I don’t think your opponents are— —trying to navigate their way— </s>
I don’t think your opponents are against that . Well , they’re mainstream media— We’re just saying that it doesn’t— </s>
Let me , let me go to another question— I’m saying— And I would just say on the new—in respect to the new media— Right there in front— —I was on the Hillman Media Awards , a year before Josh Marshall got a Polk Award , and we gave it to him for the Attorneys General reporting he did , there are good models . </s>
But , that doesn’t mean you throw out… The baby with the bathwater . I don’t know , some people over there might want— We have to have an anti-cliché rule . </s>
Yes . Too late . So I think a lot of this conversation has been about capacity capacity to provide… good reporting , integrity around reporting , accurate reporting . And I think everyone here would agree that , there’s a lot of respect for places like Huffington Post and Politico.com . That you all have the capacity , or are at least thinking about developing the capacity to provide that quality control . </s>
I’m curious about , um , what about the other , all the other mechanisms on the Internet that don’t necessarily have the capacity , nor are interested in developing the capacity to provide that quality control . So the Twitters , the Facebooks , the YouTubes where you , you log in to something and they actually say , this is what’s happening , but it’s folks , I had an experience so I downloaded something from YouTube— Ma’am , cut— Sorry , okay , so— </s>
—short to the chase , so focus in— </s>
—the question is , who has the capacity , and who is going to be responsible , for looking at quality control outside of the places we already know are interested in doing so . What you’re really saying is that there are a lotta crazy people on the Internet . </s>
A lot—a lot of crazy people . Okay , and I think that’s a fair point , because , Jim , for example , it’s not all Politico.com </s>
and I think that’s really her point , that they’re not all playing by your rules , which you brought in with you from the mainstream media . Crazy people aren’t a new invention . They’ve been around for a long time , people who tell lies have been around for a long time , people who think crap information is true , have been around for a long time . And I think that…what you’re going to see , it does put more of a burden on you , and I’ll keep coming back to this because there is so much information , you have to figure out what you trust . </s>
The reason that I’m optimistic is I feel like new media is going to solve that for you , it’s not going to be old media , it’s going to be new models in your local communication , it might not be a paper that has four or five hundred employees . It might be a series of three or four smaller websites that do very specialty reporting in those communities , some might be not-for- profit , some might be ad-supported , some might be paid content . But that’s going to happen . And it’s happening now—that’s why I’m optimistic that together we can figure this out , we are figuring this out . And there’s a reason that mainstream media is losing readers , they lost touch with their readers , there’s a reason , look at the circulation numbers that just came out . </s>
Across the board they lost 10 percent . Some newspapers lost a much higher percent , in six months , they’re just losing the readers because they didn’t retool and they didn’t start trying to get news to you the way that you wanted , maybe you want it on Twitter , maybe you want it on Facebook , maybe you want it in a newspaper , maybe you want it online . It’s companies like ours and I think companies in new media that are figuring that out and are going to be the ones that continue to provide that and continue to fact-check for you . The pink jacket , ma’am . </s>
Can you stand up , please . Yes , just to your point . You said that they’re losing readership because consumers are looking for alternate ways of getting information . And I think part of the reason for that and a question to the panel is consumers are also looking for alternate opinions . And they’re finding that the mainstream media , when 70 percent of reporters say that they are Democrats or registered Democrats , are only giving one view . </s>
And this creates a problem because the people for getting information besides the mainstream media . Phil Bronstein . And that also goes to John Hockenberry’s point , that by , just by the nature of the Internet , the people working in it , to the degree that it’s journalism , are a far more diverse group than you’ll see in any newsroom you and I have ever worked in . Well , I think it was Jim who made that point and I read on the plane here a story -- I think it was Michael’s story , maybe -- about Politico . And that it was the founders of Politico walking towards the camera . </s>
And they , while young , so there was a diversity there , they were all white males , as far as I could tell . Maybe I’m wrong about that . So I don’t know how much diversity there is . I do know , I mean , I can tell you from personal experience . </s>
I did a blog post on SF Gate , the Chronicle site , talking about how nicely the press was treating President Obama . And that post , widely circulated . I found out I had all sorts of friends I didn’t know . But , you know , that is not a story that I… that’s been scarce . </s>
In fact , I’ve read them in the last week , not just , by the way , in mainstream media but on Politico . It had a story today in which I was quoted , about how President Obama is getting treated better than President Bush was being treated , for doing some of the same things . So I don’t think that that’s an opinion that has been left out of mainstream media . I do realize there’s at minimum , a perception issue about the political bent of mainstream media . </s>
No question . John Hockenberry . I think the question is much more profound than simply are there more registered Democrats in whatever sort of hall of the media that you’re talking about . What is happening here is that the editorial process is fundamentally shifting to your point . And to your point if , distribution means of information is taken away from a small number of institutions the diversity is naturally going to increase . </s>
Further , if you have people who want to actually engage in the editorial process they don’t go to one Twitter . You know , they go to sixty or they go to sixty different platforms . I mean , they are a part of the editorial process in the same way that people who buy Beatles Rock Band get to play Ringo , if they want to . </s>
The idea is existentially being a part of the editorial process . </s>
Truth telling and fact checking on their own is part of the experience that will become the business model of the future . </s>
And if the mainstream media can’t do that because their editorial process is closed they’re going to lose circulation exactly the way Jim is talking about here . So we’re not abolishing journalists and we’re not abolishing newspapers . We are talking about a fundamental shift that changes the way these institutions have managed to survive . And good riddance to that . And that concludes round two of our debate . </s>
And here’s where we are . </s>
We are about to hear brief closing statements from each of the debaters . They will be two minutes each . </s>
And it’s their last chance to try to change your minds . And from the live audience vote beforehand we knew where you stood before this debate and here’s what we have . </s>
Our motion is : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media . And before the debate the vote among the audience members went like this : twenty-five percent are for the motion , fifty percent are against and twenty-five are undecided . You will be asked to vote one more time and pick the winner just a few minutes from now . But we want to move into round three , closing statements . </s>
And to speak first , against the motion -- and this is fortunate because you wanted to respond to what was just said -- speaking first against the motion in his summary remarks , Phil Bronstein , Executive Vice-President and Editor-at-Large of The San Francisco Chronicle . You know , I’m -- Thank you . On the car ride over here I rode with Jim . And Jim actually acknowledged that many people , even himself , consider Politico to be mainstream media . </s>
The point is really not about definitions . The arrogance that Jim referred to in newspapers for losing circulation , I think that’s a very real problem . It has been a real problem and we have lost sight -- I call it the Higher Calling Disease – of our mission . </s>
But I’m afraid I’m hearing a little too much of that same arrogance on the other panel about new media . </s>
Because , let me tell you something , you haven’t heard from any of us that we think new media is bad . They’ve made a great case that new media has all sorts of possibilities . It’s like a great , wonderful shiny object . But the proposition you’re being asked to vote on is : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media . Therefore , the proposition says , Mainstream media has to die . </s>
That’s the proposition . And my own experience is not that . </s>
My own experience is when I get together with Biz Stone , who is the co-founder of Twitter , we talk about ways in which their massive pipeline of all that data and information and Tweets might be able to be narrowed down into a verifiable set of facts that then professional journalists -- this is his view , and Twitter’s view -- professional journalists then take it and run with it . </s>
Wikimedia , I talked to one of their executives . </s>
He said , We rely deeply on mainstream media journalism . </s>
We are not arguing that that is the only way to go . </s>
Our opponents are arguing that their way , that the new media way , is the only way to go . And I just find that to be not a credible proposition . So I urge you to vote ... It can be confusing , yes . Thank you , Phil Bronstein . </s>
Summing , summing up his position , for the motion , Michael Wolff , a columnist for Vanity Fair and the founder of news aggregator , Newser.com . Michael . I’ve asked before how they’re going to do it . If they want to save , the mainstream media they got ta have a plan other than a government bailout . </s>
Phil says we want the mainstream media to die , that’s what we’re advocating . That’s not the case . What we’re saying is that the mainstream media is dying . </s>
And it’s , going to die because things have changed . It’s become obsolete . </s>
There is new technology . So even if we wanted to preserve it and most of my day is spent in the mainstream media and I would love to preserve it another year , another couple of years . Many of us about whether we will make it to retirement . </s>
I think actually we won’t . And I think that’s what we are trying to say here . </s>
It’s not to deny anything about the mainstream media -- its virtues or its faults . It’s just to acknowledge that something new has happened , a change is here . The mainstream media now is functionally Detroit . </s>
So actually , it can probably go on . It can limp on and on and on . </s>
And then it won’t be able to limp on anymore . Remember , we are all journalists here . We are arguing for our livelihoods . They’re arguing for their livelihoods . </s>
We are arguing for a new version of our livelihoods . But what you should focus on is the other people , the people we serve . We serve readers , we serve advertisers and we serve shareholders . </s>
And the mainstream media has failed in that regard and there’s no picking up the pieces . </s>
Thank you , Michael Wolff . Our motion is : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media . And summarizing her position against the motion , Katrina vanden Heuvel , editor and publisher of America’s longest running weekly , The Nation . It’s folly to deny that change is happening . I believe in accuracy . </s>
No one is talking about a government bailout for the media . But we are talking about a moment of transition and transformation . </s>
And in that moment your models -- some exciting -- are untested in terms of sustainability . </s>
And I believe , and I’m not going to use a cliché , John -- but I believe that it is not a moment to dispense with what has been of value in the mainstream media for what I believe is important , though it might be scorned up here -- which is accountability , democracy . I believe those are noble principles . </s>
And I do believe that we do need large , powerful institutions , barnacles attached , to take on powerful forces , whether corporate or government , and that the new media is beginning . Not to demean the new media , but we need to find ways of working together to salvage quality journalism , which I believe is a public good in a society where there are too many voiceless and powerless . And to me that is much more important than the myth of this liberal bias in the media . It is who is heard and how people are heard and on a variety of platforms and of all political and ethnic and racial persuasions . So that is what I believe we should today understand coming out of this hall , and be against the motion : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media , because there are important elements of that to preserve . </s>
And the new media lives with it , feeds on it and continues to need that , even though there is denial on the other side of the aisle . Thank you to Katrina vanden Heuvel . Summarizing for the motion , Jim VandeHei , Executive Editor and co-founder of Politico.com . I would urge you to vote for the proposition and I think when you’re about to vote you should think about their argument . Because I think they’re making a pretty powerful argument for us . </s>
What they want you to believe is that the mainstream media is something that it’s not . They want , they use words like hybrid or advancement or transformation . </s>
They’re basically trying to argue that they are new media and they’re not . The culture is different , the metabolism’s different . </s>
I think it’s emphatically clear that not only is new media superior , I think it’s our only hope for saving timely , serious , revelatory and profitable news . </s>
So I say , Good riddance to the slow , detached , monolithic mainstream media , which we’ve had for the past twenty years . And I say that new media , we should respect the things that these guys have talked about . </s>
We do respect the values of fairness and accuracy . But I also think that all of us in this room should embrace the diversity , the transparency , the timeliness and the innovative spirit that you see in new media . That’s where the optimism is . That’s where the ideas are . </s>
That’s where our , for us news junkies , that’s where salvation is . </s>
I urge you to remember that new media is very much in its infancy . </s>
And we can sort of laugh it off and we can talk about baby water , all we want . </s>
But new media is working out its flaws . Our people balance better the serious with the superficial . Everyone’s aware that that’s an issue . People are grappling with it and it will be solved . </s>
And we will fill the role of , the traditional role of a public servant . You can’t do public service journalism , investigative reporting or foreign policy unless you make money or unless you have government subsidy or unless you have a not-for-profit status . You have to make money to be able to support doing the foreign coverage , to support doing the investigative coverage . </s>
I’m proud to say that profit , that Politico is , in its third year , profitable and that soon we’ll be able to do more and more funding of the type of investigative reporting that we all love . We all share that . Nobody is disputing that value . </s>
So with all that in mind I think it’s abundantly clear that you should vote in favor of the proposition because the news depends on it . </s>
Thank you , Jim VandeHei . Summarizing against the motion , David Carr , media columnist and reporter for the New York Times . I want to thank the audience for their attentiveness and you , John , for keeping all the frogs in the wheelbarrow and moving them down the road . Tough job . </s>
And even though I said these guys had what I thought was a very tough set of facts , I take my hat off . I think you argued your case and argued it well . It does not mean I want you to vote for them . Here’s the thing : we’re losing audience . </s>
Mainstream media is not losing audience . We’re not a hybrid business . Who is it that , to take one website I know about -- the New York Times . </s>
We have eighteen million viewers . We have eight hundred and fifty thousand paper subscribers . We need people on all manner of platforms . Politico , you’ll be interested to know , three times a week , puts a paper out on the street . </s>
Why do they do that ? </s>
Because you got ta put the white paper out to get the green paper back . </s>
Okay , that’s how it works . The problem that he has and the problem that I have is that over time the audience has switched to the web . </s>
The audience that’s worth a buck in print is worth a dime and sometimes a penny on the web . Because we end up competing oftentimes against our own work , aggregated . </s>
Newser is a great looking site and you might want to check it out . </s>
It aggregates all manner of content . But I wonder if Michael’s really thought through getting rid of mainstream media content . Okay . Well , I’m thinking of the radio audience . I’m thinking of the radio audience and I was going to try to describe what you’re doing but I can’t . </s>
I have a rather holy sheet of newspaper -- Newser , it’s absent mainstream media content . </s>
It looks like Swiss cheese but who would want to eat Swiss cheese every day ? Vote against . Thank you , David Carr . And finally , summarizing for the motion , John Hockenberry , co-host of the public radio morning news program , The Takeaway . So , David , thank you . </s>
Now we know what those pilots on Flight 188 were doing in the cockpit . Cutting out little , pictures from Newser . I indeed am honored to be here with my colleagues and it’s great working once again with John Donvan . They have argued the point well . They have made a lot of points that remind us , perhaps nostalgically , of the journalism that we all love and that we all want preserved up here . </s>
But you must vote against them and for the proposition for the following reasons : They’ve not demonstrated that there is a way to stop the changes that are afoot . </s>
In fact , they’ve agreed that the changes are taking place . There’s no way to stop them . They have not demonstrated how journalism is , in fact , going away under our model . </s>
And they have not demonstrated that the current institutions they call the mainstream media are the only means for delivering quality journalism . What do they say ? It sounds sometimes they’re saying , We are going away . </s>
Don’t hate us . That’s pathetic and sad , but it’s not relevant . </s>
It sounds like they’re saying , We are being abolished . Don’t let them . Well , that’s simply untrue . They’re not being abolished . And in fact , they would argue that we should be abolished or that the new media should be regulated so as to prevent their content from being used in new media and having access to readers . </s>
Finally , sometimes it seems like they are saying , We deserve to be protected , but they don’t say how . And because they don’t you must vote against them . They haven’t given us a practical reason why the mainstream media either should not go away or can be prevented from going away . Finally , my brilliant colleague David Carr would have you believe that the New York Times started on this island with Pulitzer prize winning journalists who said , We got ta start this paper to confront the government . And that’s not what happened . </s>
They started selling , they sold a lot , they made a lot and the core values of the New York Times arose out of their success . The moment has passed . Vote for the proposition . And that concludes our closing statements and I just have to say to all six of the debaters , no matter how this turns out after we ask the audience to pick a winner , you came with passion and commitment and I congratulate all of you . </s>
It was a pleasure . And now it is time to pick the winner . We are going to ask you again to decide which side you agree with and from that we will figure out , from that we will determine which side has argued best . We are asking you now to go to the key pad of each seat that will register your vote . </s>
And we will get this readout almost instantaneously . Remember , push number one if you are for the motion : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media . Push number two if you are against , number three if you became or remain undecided . I’m going to have the results in just about ninety seconds so in the meantime I want to take care of a little bit of business . First of all , I want to thank of you and , again , our debaters for a terrific evening . </s>
Our next debate will be on Monday , November 16th . </s>
The motion is : Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively . Panelists for the motion are : Steve Rattner , who served as Counselor to the Secretary of the Treasury and as Car Czar : Elliot Spitzer , former Governor and Attorney General of New York : and Mark Zandi , Chief Economist and co-Founder of Moody’sEconomy.com . </s>
Against the motion we’ll have : James Galbraith , Economics Professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas : Economist Robert Kuttner , who is the co-founder and co-editor of The American Prospect : and the seventy-second Secretary of the U.S. Treasury , Paul O’Neill . Tickets are still available through our website and at the Skirball box office . All of our debates , as we said at the beginning , all of our debates will continue to be heard on more than two hundred NPR stations around the country and you can now also watch the debates on the Bloomberg Television Network . Air dates and times can be found in your program . </s>
the next edition of Newsweek and to pick up a current issue of Newsweek on your way out . And so I’m just waiting for the results and I’m turning in that direction and nothing is happening . I ... Oh , here they come . Okay , here are the results of the debate . And remember , the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner . </s>
And we now have the final results and they are : before the debate , twenty-five percent of you were for the motion , Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media : fifty percent were against and twenty-five percent were undecided . And before we reveal that , actually , when I come to the final result I’m going to raise my hand . I’ll ask you to applaud , and that’s for -- a little bit of a flourish on the radio broadcast . So when you see my arm go up , applaud . </s>
So I’m going to start this again . Before the debate , our motion being : Good Riddance to the Mainstream Media , twenty-five percent of you were for the motion , fifty percent were against , twenty-five percent were undecided . After the debate , twenty-four percent of you are for the motion , sixty-eight percent against , eight percent undecided . The side against wins the debate . Our congratulations to them . </s>
Thank you . </s>
In the meantime , John Donvan from Intelligence Squared U.S . And to launch , with opening remarks that help frame the issue for us , I 'd like to introduce the chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S. , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Welcome . Well , `` Men are finished , '' mmm . I for one hope not . </s>
But there does seem to be a lot of evidence that we are . </s>
Traditional male attributes like competitiveness , aggression and risk taking are discouraged in -- in classrooms and derided in popular culture . As a society , our values seem to be shifting toward the traditional feminine virtues of empathy , cooperation , emotional intelligence . Increasingly , men are not taking the responsibility for parenting , and women are proceeding on their own . At the top of the cognitive pyramid , women are now a majority in our universities , graduate schools of law , business and medicine . </s>
And at the bottom , the high-paid jobs men used to hold in construction have vanished with the financial crisis and those in factories have fallen victim to globalization . </s>
Men are overrepresented in prisons and in the ranks of the unemployed . And underrepresented in higher education . Project these trends forward for a couple of decade , and the future looks pretty bleak for men . </s>
On the other hand , and there always is another hand in our debates , men still hold positions of overwhelming dominance as CEOs of our largest companies and financial institutions , as creators of large-scale entrepreneurial successes , the Microsofts , Oracles , Googles , Facebooks , as top elected officials in both the federal and state governments , as the most influential artists and writers , as scientists with breakthroughs worthy of Nobel prizes and on and on . So where do you come out tonight on this question , are men finished ? The answer may depend on how you interpret the question . </s>
What we meant but could n't say in three provocative words , is whether we 're at a tipping point where women are likely to achieve in the future the same sort of dominance that men have had in the past , or whether the changes in the relative position of men and women are significant , perhaps , but hardly fundamental . Well , we have an extraordinary group of panelists to help you make that decision , and it 's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them , and to our moderator , John Donvan . And I 'm going to introduce our debaters in turn . And when I say their names , I 'd appreciate it if you could applaud for their names . </s>
But first I 'd like to ask for one more round of applause for Mr. Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible . </s>
True or false , men are finished ? That 's what we are here to debate , another verbal matchup from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . </s>
Men are finished . Two teams will be arguing that proposition from opposite sides , one for it and one against it . These teams include Dan Abrams , my colleague at ABC News , where he is chief legal analyst and author of `` Man Down , '' which gives proof that women are unequivocally better than men . His debating partner is Hanna Rosin . She is a senior editor at the Atlantic and founding editor of XX , a woman-focused section of the online magazine , Slate . </s>
Nothing like a packed house . Opposing them at the facing table , Christina Hoff Sommers . She is a philosophy professor and author of Who Stole Feminism ? and The War Against Boys . Her partner , David Zinczenko , executive vice president and editor in chief of Men 's Health magazine . </s>
Now , this is the debate . It is a contest . One team will win , and one team will lose in this joust of ideas . And you , our live audience here at the Skirball Center will be functioning as our judges . By the time the debate has ended , you will have been asked to vote twice , once before the debate and once again afterwards to register where you stand on this motion , `` Men are finished . '' </s>
And the team that has changed the most of your minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner . So let 's go to your preliminary vote . If you go to these key pads at your seat , they have numbers one through three along the top row . </s>
If you agree with the motion , `` Men are finished , '' push number one . If you disagree , push number two . And if you are undecided , push number three . And if you feel that you 've made an error , just correct it , and the system will lock in your last vote . </s>
And what we 're going to do is tabulate those . And at the end of the debate after the second vote , I 'll present both numbers . And reminding you again the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner . So our motion is , `` Men are finished . '' </s>
And now onto round one , opening statements by each debater in turn . They will be seven minutes each . And I 'd like to introduce first for the motion , Hanna Rosin . </s>
She is an award-winning journalist for Slate and the Atlantic . Her 2010 cover story , which was titled , `` The End of Men , '' provoked a fire storm of responses . She is now writing a book expanding on her theory that men are losing their dominance . And as a matter of fact , she went to high school , Stuyvesant , a few blocks away from here where I understand you were a debater ? I was a debater , and I 'm hoping I can channel that inner nerd tonight and bring it right back again . </s>
Did -- did you beat the boys a lot ? We beat everybody . But my partner was a boy , so I do n't know if that counts . Ladies and gentlemen , Hanna Rosin . </s>
I 'd like to welcome you all to this debate tonight . I 'd even like to welcome the men to the debate tonight although of course I pity you . </s>
Just kidding . Before I dive in , I just want to say -- I just want to start with a definition . What do we mean by men are finished ? </s>
We 'd like you to think of this as the writing on the wall , as the sign that points to an inevitable future . What I mean by that is that in order to win this debate , we do n't have to prove that there are no male geniuses , that there 's no more male CEOs , that Bill Gates and Steve Jobs are figments of your imagination or that all the men are any minute going to be rounded up and locked up as -- only to be released every once in a while as sex slaves . That would be -- that would be a preposterous standard . Maybe it sounds good to you guys . </s>
But what we do have to prove , and what we will prove is that the world where men dominate the public sphere and where the male traits are the ones that lead to success is the world that we are currently saying goodbye to . </s>
We are living through an unprecedented moment in history where the power dynamics between men and women are shifting very radically . I 'll start with the fundamentals . In 2010 , for the first time ever , women became the majority of the work force . This is kind of an amazing fact . </s>
As recently as the 1980s , the working woman was such a cool new sociological phenomenon that there were several sitcoms dedicated to her existence , which many of you might remember . Now she is the majority of the work force . If you look back at your professional schools that you guys went to , law school , medical school , accounting , even business schools , you are likely to find that women are the majority of all of those schools . </s>
And last year for the first time , women became 54 percent of all American managers . </s>
Now , how are men doing these days ? They 're doing very , very badly . </s>
The annual income of men peaked around 1973 , which is just when women started to get going . </s>
Right now , one in five men are out of work , which is the highest percentage that 's ever existed . When Larry Summers was recently asked by the New York Times what keeps him up at night , you would think he would have mentioned the healthcare crisis or maybe the many , many gaps he has made over his long career , but he did not mention either of those things . </s>
What he mentioned was this one in five ratio which he described as having vast social consequences . Now , why is this happening ? The very simple answer is college . Most economists agree that what you need to get ahead these days is pretty simple . </s>
It 's just a college degree . </s>
But women , for some reason , are much better these days at getting college degrees than men . For every two men who get a college degree , three women will do the same . So why are women getting more college degrees ? </s>
It 's not that women are smarter because they 're not smarter . These days , men and women test about the same on standardized tests for both math and English . But women have something . </s>
Some sociologists call it grit , some call it engagement , some call it focus , some call it social intelligence . It 's some special formula that 's required for success these days , which women just seem to have in greater abundance than men . And this is a very new thing . </s>
Now , I imagine that our opponents are going to concede that women do better in college . But then they 're going to say so what ? Women are goody goodies , then they go to work , and they just flame out , and they never get anywhere else . But this is , of course , completely preposterous . </s>
For one thing , it 's only been happening for about a generation and a half , and you already see the results in the economy . You already see that for women under 30 these days are making more money than men under 30 . </s>
And that 's really , really new . Also women are getting much more aggressive than they ever were , which is something that 's brand new . And also the qualities that we think of as making a great leader are starting to be defined as more feminine than masculine which is something that my partner is going to talk about later . So now you really have to be blind not to see the effects of this all around us in the culture . We 've all gotten used to the new guy antihero or what my friend at Slate calls the omega male who 's two rungs below the alpha in the wolf pack . </s>
And so we see him in the Judd Apatow movies , we see him in the Bud Light commercials . He 's sitting around , putting his feet up , drinking beers , basically not working and not sure what to do with his life , he 's still wearing Keds and a band T-shirt even though he 's well into his 40s and at an age where men in generations before were already picking their kids up from college . I just spent the last couple of weeks watching the new sitcoms for the new TV season . </s>
The theme for this TV season was called by TV Guide the emasculation of men , and here again you have lots and lots of guys playing videogames while their wives work , sometimes they work double shifts , their wives are working powerhouse jobs , and they 're coming home to see their husbands play videogames . One of the guys in the sitcoms , one of the characters decided that he was going to bestow his business upon his granddaughter and not his grandson because his granddaughter had an MBA from Purdue and his grandson as he put it was a jet skiing idiot . </s>
So this is the middle class 's reflection of itself these days . Now we 're on to my favorite subject which is male vanity , the new male vanity . </s>
Lose your guts , 30 red hot sex secrets . </s>
Dave Zinczenko will recognize these phrases because they come from the cover of his magazine , Men 's Health . </s>
Once upon a time men 's magazines used to actively flaunt their dominance and aggression . The very first issue of Playboy called women people who crush man 's adventurous free loving spirit . </s>
These days they seem to flaunt male insecurity . Men are fueling the rise in plastic surgery , hair products , and waxes . If you look at the back at the 1986 Sexiest Man Alive , you 'll see Mark Harmon who basically looks like an orangutan by the standards of the day , he 's got hair coming out of his shoulders , coming out of his thighs , he 's a really big hairy man . </s>
These days the men are waxing and primping more than I have ever done in my entire life , as we all became deeply familiar with , unfortunately , when we have the close-up of Anthony Weiner . </s>
Now , from my opponents , you 'll likely hear a lot of talk about the new generation about how men are still geniuses , men are still inventors , how they drive the technology industry . </s>
I have a few things to say to that . First of all , we 're talking about a tiny percentage of men , and they 're more than balanced out by the men at the other end who are incarcerated or having trouble in school . </s>
It 's perfectly possible that we 'll have a handful of great inventors and that still broadly speaking men are finished . </s>
You 're also likely to hear about the Fortune 500 list and at the echelons of Hollywood and how few women there are out there at the top . I hear this argument on nearly every panel that I 'm on and my answer is always the same , duh , men have been at this for 40,000 years and women have only been at this for 40 years , so of course the world does n't flip upside- down overnight . </s>
But the writing on the wall is still clear , men are finished , which is why you should vote for us . Thank you , Hanna Rosin . `` Men are finished '' is our motion and now here to speak against the motion I 'd like to introduce Christina Hoff Sommers . She 's a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute . </s>
She is a critic of radical feminism and the author of The War Against Boys and also Who Stole Feminism ? </s>
Does the answer to that question figure in to the argument you 're going to make here tonight ? Oh , actually it does , in Who Stole Feminism I argued against a very ferocious form of male bashing feminism and in favor of a feminism that affirmed friendship and equality and mutual respect between the sexes and I 'm going to talk a lot about that tonight . All right . Here we go . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Christina Hoff Sommers . </s>
First of all , men are not finished . Yes , yes , indeed , women are joining men as partners in running the world but they 're not replacing them . Women are flourishing in ways which are unprecedented , exciting , glorious . But men have hardly vanished from the limelight . I mean , after almost 40 years of gender neutral pronouns , men are still more likely than women to run for political office , start businesses , file patents , write editorials , tell jokes . </s>
They conduct the orchestras . </s>
They direct the great movies . They blow up things . Now , I admit blowing up things is problematic . I wish they would do less of it . Men commit most acts of wanton violence . </s>
But , at the same time , it usually takes other men to stop them . </s>
The “males are in decline” crowd seem to imagine a world of consensus-building women , happily and confidently interacting and managing the new economy . They point to an explosion of jobs for nurturers and communicators , more social workers , veterinarians , dance therapists , teachers . The problem is that you can’t sustain a network of nurturers and communicators without someone paying for it . You’re still going to need ambitious , hard-driven innovators , manufacturers , engineers , construction workers , along with police officers , firefighters and the military . </s>
Now , we’re told that toughness and assertiveness , those are obsolete , fit for another age , not the 21st century . That’s absurd . It’s worse than absurd . </s>
It borders on being ungrateful and even elitist . It ignores the actions and virtues of the very people that make it possible for us to assemble here tonight and debate whether men are in decline . It reminds me of a quote by -- well , attributed to George Orwell . </s>
Orwell allegedly said , “We sleep peaceably in our beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on our behalf.” Well , the world is still dangerous , and our civilization still depends on the protection of brave men and some women who are willing to fight and die to protect us . Now , Hanna concedes that men are still at the top of the pyramid , but she says , quote , “Men’s hold on power in elite circles is loosening.” </s>
Loosening ? Yes , of course . I agree . And I welcome it . </s>
But it’s not evidence of a female takeover . I mean , just think about it . Women have amazing talents . </s>
They can be as dazzling as men when they set their minds to it . But the sexes are equal . But they exercise their equality in different ways . </s>
Consider science and technology . Women now hold a majority of college degrees , and they hold most of the jobs in fields like psychology , veterinary medicine , biology . It’s quite likely women are not only going to compete with men but surpass them in these fields and , indeed , very exciting to behold . </s>
They’re just as competitive as men in those fields , if not more . But those numbers don’t hold in other fields . Math , technology , engineering -- those are fields where men prevail by huge numbers . “And give them time , ” says Hanna . “Women have only just begun , and that women are in ascendancy . </s>
They’re going to gain momentum.” Where is it ? I see no sign of it . </s>
According to a recent study by the Commerce Department , women’s numbers in computer science and mathematics have actually gone down in the last 10 years . I mean , if Hanna were right , these trends -- we would begin to see women taking over , or at least showing some progress . We see no progress , very little progress in those fields . Now , ask yourself , is technology finished ? </s>
Is engineering finished ? Is the military finished ? Are dangerous jobs like working on an oil rig or being a police officer or a roofer , a logger -- are those finished ? Now , it’s true that minimally educated men are in serious trouble . And I agree very much with Hanna that this is a matter of grave concern . </s>
Girls do better than boys in school . They get better grades . They score higher on reading and writing tests . </s>
They’re more likely to go to college . </s>
The reason for girls’ educational success , they’re complicated and surely have something to do with a complex combination of innate and cultural differences . Teenage girls , for example , tend to pay attention better than teenage boys . </s>
But instead of declaring men finished because of their educational deficits , we should be looking for ways to make our classrooms friendlier places for boys and young men , and more conducive to their success . Why are we even having this debate about men’s demise ? The reason is we are living in an era you could call “WAW , ” women are wonderful . It’s a phenomenon that’s been identified by some psychologists . And it used to be fashionable to celebrate men’s superiority over women when women were truly the second sex . </s>
Fortunately , those chauvinist days are long gone . Today , a new kind of reverse chauvinism is in ascendancy , female chauvinism . Magazines , TV shows , yes , sitcoms claim , you know , the endless heroics about girl power , `` You go , girl , '' claiming that women are better at everything . Women are better leaders , women are better communicators , all around better human beings . I saw one-story that said women have better orgasms than men . </s>
The rules of the WAW game make it impossible for them to -- to win , because if women do something better than men , that 's evidence of their superiority . If men outperform women , that 's proof of discrimination and the continuing male culture . What you see tonight on the other side of the stage is an extreme form of the WAW phenomenon . The idea that men are finished is crazy . </s>
Men and women complement each other . We are not separate teams competing for a trophy . This is not a zero sum competition . </s>
We 're dance partners like Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers . Our fates are inextricably tied together . </s>
If one is in trouble , so is the other . Several years ago the Hasbro toy company manufactured a toy house . They wanted to manufacture -- they wanted to sell it to both boys and girls . </s>
The girls came in , and the boys . </s>
The girls played constructively with the dolls . The kids took the dolls and played house . The boys catapulted the baby carriage from the roof . And the Hasbro general manager had a brilliant explanation : Boys and girls are different . Christina the sum of your time is up . </s>
I 'm almost finished . I 've got to -- I 've got to -- </s>
I 'm almost finished . I -- I -- -- I ca n't let you . I 'm sorry . </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you . </s>
Pleasure . </s>
Okay . </s>
A reminder of what 's going on . We are halfway through the opening statements of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have four debaters , two teams of two , who are fighting it out over this motion , men are finished . </s>
We have heard two of the opening statements and now onto the third . I 'd like to introduce Dan Abrams . He is chief legal analyst for ABC News . </s>
He is also the author of a book whose title is a lot of fun to read . </s>
It 's called `` Man Down : Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt that Women are Better Cops , Drivers , Gamblers , Spies , World Leaders , Beer Tasters , Hedge Fund Managers and Just About Everything Else . '' I notice that you do n't say women are better legal analysts . Have you raised the bar for men with your performance ? </s>
No , no , no . There 's just the -- the obvious example of the woman who is a better legal analyst . </s>
Of course , there 's Nancy Grace who 's -- Ladies and gentlemen , Dan Abrams . -- my frequent opponent . </s>
How the heck did Dan Abrams , a far too old to still be single guy , not particularly known as a feminist end up writing a book about female superiority ? Did he do it to meet women ? Did he -- did he do it to pander ? </s>
You know , it 's always frustrating for me when I 'm asked about a single reason why I wrote the book . I did it for both reasons , and it 's worked incredibly well . Now , it has not had any substantial impact on my social life , and there is no question that that sort of silliness is what has gotten my book , `` Man Down , '' far more attention than it ever would have received . </s>
I made a case based on evidence and men 's rights groups and others have attacked me , saying , `` He did n't use the scientific method in this book . '' Look , this book was , at times , a fun , tongue-in-cheek effort . </s>
So I separate it into two broad themes , chapters that at least get people reevaluating their preconceived notions and others which I think truly prove female superiority . </s>
Can I definitively prove that women are really better spies or competitive eaters or even they tolerate pain better than men for certain , or even my beloved chapter on women handling breakups better than men ? I presented evidence . </s>
I presented studies , research . But certainly someone on the other side could attack those chapters . So let 's put the frivolous aside and talk about the evidence that examines issues that are important . </s>
Hanna talked about women as students . </s>
They 'll be better educated . They 'll navigate tough economies better . They 'll be better equipped for the workplace of the next generation . But I do n't know . </s>
What about politics , finance , taking care of the planet ? These are areas where the evidence is crystal clear and maybe just as important the trends for the future support women and also help explain why women lag in certain areas . </s>
Let 's start with politics . </s>
Women vote more , period , both in number of votes and the percentage of the population . In terms of registered voters in the year 2000 , 61 percent of women voted . 58 percent of men . In 2004 , 65-62 ; 2008 , with more women on the ballots , by the way , 66-62 . </s>
Same thing in midterm elections in 2010 . 53 percent of those who voted were female . </s>
But wait , they , we are still tending to elect more women -- sorry , more men . </s>
Four out of five being elected are men . In fact , in 2010 , women gained no Senate seats . And for the first time in 30 years , lost House seats . </s>
This is true for now . But once the women voters and the men realize how much more effective female leaders are , it will not -- it can not continue . </s>
Men will be if not finished , certainly marginalized , the very first research has come out this year evaluating men and women in Congress . The American journal for political science reported this year that from 1984 to 2004 women won their home districts an average of $ 49 million more per year than their male counterparts . Women sponsored more bills . They cosponsored many more bills . They attracted a greater number of cosponsors than their male colleagues . </s>
In addition , two Ohio State political science professors tracked every bill passed between 1981 and 2009 and found that those sponsored by women survived further into the legislative process , received more attention and were more likely to be deemed important overall . And as political leaders and police officers , for that matter -- you mentioned police officers -- women are less corruptible . Two major international studies , one at the World Bank development research group , one from Williams College analyzed data from dozens of countries ' parliaments , plus a 93-country survey . They took a count of corruption levels within the countries . </s>
They took a count of culture , religion , education . The results were clear . The more women legislators , the less corruption in a legislature . </s>
So what the heck 's going on ? Why are n't there more women ? I think a 2008 Pew research study explains it all . They surveyed 2,250 people , asked them about eight traits key to political leaders and whether they thought men or women were superior . </s>
Honesty , overwhelmingly women ; intelligence , women ; hard working tied ; compassionate , outgoing , creative , overwhelmingly women , women , women ; ambition , tied . </s>
The only one of the eight relevant traits where men were deemed superior , decisiveness . In that same study , though , only six percent of the respondents felt women made better political leaders . Similar results when it came to newscasters . </s>
A rigorous study done , male and female news casters reading the exact same message . The participants agreed that when it came from a woman , they viewed it adds more credible . And yet when those same people were asked , are men or women news casters more credible , they said men . There is only so long men will be able to thrive , much less survive on the fumes of past sexism and assumptions . </s>
Now , finance . You do n't need to survey the attitude of the people in finance . 2009 and 2010 , Wall Street Journal and New York Times published articles entitled , `` For Mother 's Day , give her the reins to the portfolio '' and `` How men 's overconfidence hurts them as investors . '' Both presented multiple statistics that men were taking more risks based on less information , buying and selling more often and losing more money . Female hedge fund managers outperformed their male counterparts from 2000 to 2009 according to hedge fund research by a whopping three percent . </s>
Business Week reported that when the downturn began , funds run by women lost 9.6 percent compared to 19 percent for men . </s>
Yes , women are only a fraction of the hedge fund managers . Maybe they have to work harder to get there . </s>
Maybe these are the females who are at the top of the game . </s>
But in the world of finance , numbers should speak for themselves . </s>
And all other things equal , anyone who wants to make money out to go with a woman . Finally , new studies show that women are more committed to protecting the planet . They recycle more . They 're more likely to be green . </s>
They eat less meat . They take shorter trips . In part because they give and follow better directions than men . They take public transportation more . </s>
They are also better and safer bus drivers . They save gas by speeding less . They make more eco purchases . Heck , God has decided that men are finished . </s>
Between 1995 and 2008 , 82 percent of lightning strikes were on men . So bottom line , why are women still lagging in so many areas ? Three reasons : Married or unmarried , they 're still primarily responsible for childcare ; two , they often lack the overconfidence of men ; and three , sexism . When number one may not ever change for certain , number two and three will . </s>
They must . And then us men are in big trouble . </s>
Thank you , Dan Abrams . </s>
`` Men are finished , '' that is our motion and now here to speak against the motion , David Zinczenko , who is executive vice president and editor in chief of Men 's Health Magazine . He is editorial director of both Women 's Health and Prevention Magazine and he 's a bestselling author . </s>
And Men 's Health -- it 's about fitness , it 's about technology , it 's about handling your finances , so if men were going down the tubes , you would have your finger on the pulse of all of these -- </s>
We would know , John . Men are n't finished . Dan may be finished . But men are n't finished . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , David Zinczenko . Thank you . Thank you , John , and thank you , Dan . </s>
I want you to vote against this proposition , against this misguided motion because it 's preposterous . Men ca n't possibly be finished because as all of you know , when men are finished , they roll over immediately and go to sleep . </s>
That 's not happening . Clearly men are not rolling over . Now , they will have you believe that , that is the case . It 's not , if anything they continue to do what they have always done , invent new technology -- makes them smarter -- lead nations , build bridges , drive corporations , yes , win elections , and to your point quite sadly , tweet pics of their genitalia to complete strangers . That 's true . </s>
Nothing 's changed . Now , our opponents are arguing that men have lost their edge , that women now outpace men in both graduate and undergraduate degrees while the world 's economy continues to place greater and greater importance on education . And men are certainly falling behind in this regard as you know through the mancession or great he-cession , nearly 78 percent initially of the job losses belong to men , yes . Men make up the largest sector of the unemployed , they are the majority of people in prison , in rehab , the majority of people who ought to be in rehab . </s>
And as Jeff Foxworthy might have put it , very few women say as their last words , `` Hey , watch this . '' It 's a fact . Testosterone fueled accidents and testosterone fueled illnesses fell men seven years sooner than women . So how can I concede these points right at the top of this debate and still say you must vote against this measure ? It 's simple . </s>
All of the statistics that my opponents will be citing tonight are indicative of a trend . Women are beginning to catch up to men . </s>
But the pace of that progress is inexorably slow . </s>
According to the United Nations women perform two-thirds of the world 's work , but only earn a fraction of the world 's income . Men own 99 percent of the world 's property and rule 92 percent of its sovereign nations . </s>
Now , I did n't get through all of Freakonomics , admittedly , but these do not seem like winning statistics for that side . Obviously , the other 150 million American males out there are n't particularly alarmed either . </s>
I do n't think anybody came through a gauntlet of men protesting the topic of this debate out there burning their jockstraps . Men are n't finished . You have to vote against this motion . Now , what 's going on ? </s>
In part it 's the biological drive . There is a women 's movement for the simple reason that women are willing to move together more as a unit . </s>
Men are rugged individualists . </s>
They want to move together probably but they -- none is willing to stop and ask for directions . So that 's the way that men are , and we need to move beyond our opponents ' assertions that there 's something wrong with that . </s>
It may not be true that the male of the species is in fact stronger , braver , or more action oriented in times of crisis , but we are certainly still asked to play an outsize role . </s>
It was still men who spent those long weeks in the Chilean mine . It’s still men who make up 90 percent of the on-the-job deaths , performing dangerous tasks at dangerous hours . It was still 343 firemen who lost their lives 10 years ago in the World Trade Center . And while women are clearly capable of heroic actions in desperate circumstances , I personally am in awe of Rupert Murdoch’s wife . </s>
We are hard-wired as a species to count on the comforts of masculine leadership . </s>
Even women who aspire to become leaders often seem to take on the trappings of masculinity . </s>
Consider Sarah Palin who dobbed such masculine traits as wearing black leather jackets , carrying a gun , bragging about how hot her spouse is . Or Michele Bachmann whose tribute to traditional masculinity includes putting down gays and trying to pretend our daughters are still virgins . Yes , women are making enormous gains in education . They now earn the majority of graduate and undergraduate degrees . And I feel terrible , just terrible , for Bill Gates and Barry Diller and Sergey Brin and Mark Zuckerberg and Tyler Perry and Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs and all the other poor non-degree-holding men who were too busy becoming billionaires to finish their homework . </s>
Awful . </s>
It’s so tough . It would have been much better -- It would have been much better if they had just stayed at home , stayed in school , taken on their share of the more than $ 1 trillion in student loan debt , the majority of which now belongs to -- you guessed it -- the fairer sex . Of course , there’s self-made women billionaires -- Oprah , Martha , J.K. Rowling , imaginative visions shared worldwide . </s>
But it’s men who flood the patent offices with their big ideas . And until a woman invents the next Google or Facebook or iPad or bass- o-matic -- -- the economic inequality between men and women will not be righted in our lifetimes . So , men are driven to achieve power and influence . Men aren’t worried about losing out to women . They’re still too focused on not losing out to other men . </s>
That’s why men are not finished . </s>
And it’s why you have to vote against this ridiculous proposition . </s>
Thank you , David Zinczenko . And that concludes round one of this U.S. Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being debated is `` Men are finished . '' </s>
All right , so we’re going to move on to round two , and this is one of those times when I would solicit your highly spontaneous applause . Welcome back to this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I’m John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We’re at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . </s>
Our motion is `` Men are finished , '' and we have two teams debating this motion . We have Hanna Rosin and Dan Abrams arguing for the motion that `` Men are finished . '' They’re saying that as a result of a changing economy and shifting cultural values , men who once , like it or not , were seen as the dominant sex , the bosses and the breadwinners , are now already in a deep slide to number two status . </s>
Arguing against them , saying that men are not finished , Christina Hoff Sommers and David Zinczenko . They’re saying that men are doing just fine , thank you , that they still hold most of the power . </s>
And besides , just because women are doing better , that does not mean that men have to be doing worse . We’re in round two where the debaters are going to be able to talk directly to each other and take questions from you and from myself and from readers of Slate who are watching this debate online . And I’d like to start with initially with a question to the side that’s arguing for the motion , and I think perhaps to you , Hanna Rosin . </s>
Your opponents are making the case that part of the reason that the notion is afloat , that `` Men are finished , '' is because there’s an attitude about , there’s a sense that women can only be doing better if men are doing worse , that this is a zero-sum game . So is it ? Is it not possible for both sides to do well without this imbalance resulting ? It is possible , but it just doesn’t work that way . I mean , if we can all agree that there was male dominance for a long time and that male dominance is over , then I think we agree that men are finished . </s>
So the resolution is about male dominance which we’ve taken for granted for so many tens of thousands of years . And so , even if you have parity , you have the end of male dominance . I mean , if you have women rising and catching up to men , then you no longer have male dominance . And so that 's what I meant when I , early on , tried to define the resolution as men are finished , the era of male dominance , it 's finished , which we 've taken for granted for all this time . Christina Hoff Sommers . </s>
But the opposite of male dominance is not female dominance . It 's mutuality . That 's fine . Men are still finished . I mean , men are finished as the dominant sex . </s>
I 'm not -- They are not finished . That 's absurd . </s>
You agreed to it in your opening that you did n't want to say men are finished . You thought there might be inklings of a suggestion that it may be happening . </s>
But what you 're defending now is that men are finished . I 'm saying it 's absurd . I 'm saying that some men are in trouble . But rather than declare their extinction , we should be doing what we can to help them . </s>
And that is -- </s>
Totally . -- not happening in our schools . </s>
Our schools are -- </s>
I 'm not saying we should crush them further . I mean -- </s>
Well , let 's talk about -- Dan Abrams . You say we need to -- we need to do that in our schools , and yet that 's exactly what universities have tried , which is to have affirmative action for men . It 's gotten that bad . And the problem is that the civil rights -- </s>
Wait . Why are they laughing ? </s>
This is true . </s>
Yeah . Schools have affirmative action for men . No , and the civil rights commission actually investigated this , and may investigate it again because the situation has gotten so dire at our universities that we feel the need to discriminate against women . </s>
Is that the solution ? </s>
That 's frightening . Christina . The civil rights commission chose not to investigate it . </s>
It never happened , but -- No , they did investigate it . They -- they did not . They did not . They -- I know -- </s>
However , they -- -- as to why they shut down the investigation and -- </s>
It does n't matter . -- believe me -- They shut it down . -- you do n't want to get into why they shut . Because they did not want to get into it and -- </s>
All right . </s>
Let 's move forward on the impasse . Let 's move forward . Let 's not have an impasse . But if you look at the early grades as how young men are treated in our schools , it 's a very girl friendly environment . </s>
And boys are not keeping up with -- with the girls . But does that mean boys are finished ? We had massive effort -- well -- But seriously , is that -- is that not -- Christina , is that not indicative of -- of their argument that the system is set up in such a way that males , let 's say , are on a bad track ? </s>
Males are n't on a bad track . But our system is rigged against them . And if you look into the average classroom , it 's a male averse environment . </s>
Schools , for example , now do n't allow rough and tumble play . There is zero tolerance for male rambunctiousness . You have schools where they do n't allow them to play tag where anyone is out . They have to replace it with games like circle of friends , tug-of-war . Tug-of-war has become tug of peace . </s>
This is not -- this is hostile to the interests of young men . And it gets more serious if you look at the readings . A friend of mine at Harvard graduate school of education did a content analysis of textbooks , readers for eighth and -- seventh and eighth grade social studies class . </s>
She said you 'd think the American West was settled by teenage girls traveling with parents . So male heroes have been taken out . Boys are badly neglected . Well -- Now -- just one last point . </s>
We did a lot to help girls and to strengthen them in math and science . At the same time , we did nothing to help boys with their reading and writing skills and their college matriculation -- But it seems like you 're -- Dan Abrams . </s>
-- conceding that men are finished . I mean , what you 're doing is you 're saying , yes , men are finished , and here 's why we need to change it . I said men are in trouble . </s>
That 's not the same as saying they are finished . David -- David Zinczenko . I mean , I would just say that -- </s>
David , could you move just a tiny bit to -- I mean , what 's happening here is what needs to happen . They are on the ridiculous side of this issue . So they have to attempt to redefine it . </s>
If the issue is that the stranglehold on men is coming to the end or men omnipotence is finished , well , two things would be happening . </s>
We would be conceding right off the bat that men 's omnipotence is finished , and this debate would be taking place in 1962 , okay . The fact is that , at this point , we have come to accept a shared power structure between men and women . </s>
And it really does n't matter . It 's not the issue that we 're really discussing here , which is why you have to vote against this motion . Wait . </s>
What was that phrase you used , surviving off the fumes of sexism ? I think we are our finest example there . Well , I 'm -- David Zinczenko . </s>
Oh , you want to concede to Hanna Rosin . I think you scored on that one . </s>
I want to make another point about police officers which Christina made a reference to consistently , and I think it 's indicative , actually , of the larger issue , which is people like to think , oh , you know , men will be the better police officers because they 're bigger and stronger . And if I was out there , and I needed someone , I 'd want a big , strong police officer . Well , okay in certain cases . </s>
But what if I told you that there is solid evidence to demonstrate that women can defuse a violent situation better than men can ? Hmm . Okay . </s>
Now instead of having to tackle the guy , you can get the guy to a -- you can avoid a conflict altogether and then avoid taxpayer lawsuits and have less corruption within your police force . Hmm . </s>
Suddenly we 're looking at police officers in a totally different way . Does that mean that there 's no advantage to being faster or bigger ? </s>
No . But the number of times in real life as opposed to the movies where people are actually sort of running down across the street to catch the guy jumping over the fence is actually pretty far -- you know , it 's pretty rare . All right , well -- Christina Hoff Sommers . </s>
First of all , do n't trust Dan and -- and his statistics . He is -- he has a fairly serious case of -- And he 's a columnist for Men 's Health magazine . </s>
He has the hardest time getting his pieces through our fact-checking department . </s>
Dan -- </s>
He is so fired , yeah , yeah . It 's ridiculous . Did you not say -- did n't you not claim in your book that women have better physical endurance ? </s>
Did you not claim that women could take pain better than men ? Yes . Both of these things are false . </s>
There is a vast library of literature -- Childbirth . Childbirth . Childbirth . Epidural , epidural , invented by men . </s>
Yes . Sorry . What 's the question ? Endurance , physical endurance . </s>
Yeah . </s>
You think that women have better physical endurance . </s>
That 's that there is an advantage that women have with estrogen and fat that provides them an advantage -- </s>
Fat ? It 's true , yes . It 's true . I rest my case . It allows -- </s>
I rest my case . It allows women to engage certain endurance activities better and longer than men . That does not mean they 're faster . </s>
Name one activity . I 'll tell you one . </s>
In the -- in the ultra marathons is the only race where women can beat men , okay ? This is -- Do n't clap . </s>
He 's just wrong . He 's got to be -- It 's not true ? Am I making it up ? </s>
You are making it up . -- that a woman won the ultra marathon . It 's the only sport where men versus women , that women -- I did n't say always win . Women can win . Oh , one woman won in the Mojave Desert a couple of years ago . </s>
But wait a sec . Wait a sec . </s>
There 's a -- There 's a huge record -- -- fact that a woman beat a man in an athletic competition is unheard of . The bottom line is men are still better athletes than women . </s>
Men are stronger than women , and they 're faster than women . But the one area where women can compete is in areas where it requires excessive endurance . And these ultra marathons are 135 miles plus . Just to stop this discussion , there 's some very good articles that have come out in recent years . Just look at Richard Coast at Northern Arizona University who did a definitive study to undue this myth that was born in the '90s where they predicted women -- it came in Nature magazine . </s>
They predicted women were going to win the marathon in 1998 . </s>
It came and went . Women did n't win . </s>
They 're not going to win the marathon . They 're not . The bottom line is men are -- And they 're not winning the ultra marathon . No , it 's not true . </s>
And what Coast and other experts say is the longer and the -- the test of endurance , the greater the gap favoring males . </s>
You 've just got it wrong . You 've got your facts wrong . It 's not wrong . The reality -- </s>
All right . We 're going to move past on that one . </s>
Okay . What about billiards ? </s>
Sorry ? Billiards . Oh , billiards . Billiards , yes . </s>
Christina , I want to put a question to you -- a question to you . You -- you talked about fields where men 's , I would say , brawn is relevant ; firefighters , the people who protect us , soldiers . You mentioned loggers . </s>
And -- and they 're kind of creating a world where they 're saying it 's -- it 's more important now to be a blogger than to be a logger , that -- that there is -- that it 's a Facebook world , and the Facebook world works better for women in many different ways , the social skills , et cetera . </s>
So I just wanted you to take on that notion that structurally we 're changing so that the relevance of female characteristics to the economy , their economic value has become enhanced , while male so-called characteristics , brawn , for example -- I do n't disagree with Dan or Hanna that there -- there 's a female ascendancy which I find as exciting as -- both as a woman and grandmother of Eliza . I like to see these opportunities for women and women moving into centers of power . But again , I insist that what they 're doing is forging a partnership with men in running the world . They 're not taking over . </s>
And -- and women are men are equal but different . And I think women are dazzling but in different ways . And so if I had been allowed to finish when I was up there instead of -- Now -- now you -- -- only a woman was not allowed . </s>
No , no , now you 've got that moment , so I would take it . </s>
When I talked about the boys and girls with the doll house , and the boys catapulted the baby carriage from the roof , even when -- when men and women get older , there 's this complementarity . We still need the catapulters . We still need the nurturers . </s>
Typically if a parent -- you know , a father and mother go to a park with a child and there 's a jungle gym , the mother will say , `` Be careful . '' The father will say , `` Can you get to the top ? '' I think that we need both the nurturers and the catapulters and that the idea that we 're going to have one over the other is unknown and can -- But the notion that the -- that so-called feminism qualities which would include what , Hanna , become more relevant economically ? </s>
You know , I 'm so reluctant to enter this WAW women are wonderful -- how do we say it -- debate ? I mean , I do n't know that women are particularly awesome , like when I enter this bloggers versus loggers conversation , this is n't a value judgment like loggers are losers , it 's not the -- that 's not the motto -- The loggers are going to be so relieved to hear you . </s>
Loggers are not losers , we 'll make the T-shirt after this debate , that 's not what our side represents , it 's just that they 're an incredibly shrinking part of the American economy . </s>
It just is . </s>
It 's really not a value judgment ; it 's like whatever it is that women have -- you know , people have called it so many things . </s>
They 've called it grit . They 've called it emotional intelligence . They 've called it focus . </s>
Nobody really knows what it is . Some people try to say , like , oh , it 's in the hardwiring of the brains of women . </s>
I 'm not sure it 's in the -- it might be that women have been behind all these years and now they 're catching up the way immigrants do , it might be that , but it 's just an economic fact that whatever it is -- I just have a question for Hanna -- David , and then go -- Well , if you look at all of the relevant stats , what you see is this is not the case , that when you look at concentrations of wealth , when you look at poverty in the United States and elsewhere , the deck has been stacked against women . </s>
That is not good . We need more gender equality . But in their world they have to twist what this debate means . And the fact is if men adjust to the work life realities , they are emasculated and feminized and therefore they lose . </s>
If they do n't adapt to the new reality , men are emasculated and unnecessary and irrelevant and antiquated , and they lose . So I think women can become CEOs , they can become stay at home moms , they can be considered masters of the new universe , and it is easy to structure in your mind the decline and fall of men when in your own mind when all the rules are stacked against your opponents , but here in the real world there is no truth to the facts . </s>
Well , let me put the questions here aside then , in this -- we 're talking about a process and we 're talking about possibly being in the early stages of the process of male loss of dominance to women , so what is the endgame ? Thirty years from now if this process continues and accelerates , where are men as you imagine it , I mean , are we all wearing diapers in a closet somewhere or -- -- where are we in the picture if this continues ? Where did the diapers come from ? </s>
Infantilization . I get it , infantilization , well , I mean , you want to talk about the saddest part of this ? </s>
When you guys say something like `` logger , '' you make it sound like it 's a very tiny minute percentage of the population . We 're actually talking about 60 percent of the population that 's not college educated , okay ? </s>
So you keep mentioning Bill Gates . </s>
This is the American middle class , okay ? You tap into the American middle class , I 've done a lot of reporting on this issue , it is actually sad . I mean , you see that women are holding up these families , they 're in community colleges , the men are struggling , and for some reason they 're not getting the message that they have to go to school . So I think we can be in one of two different places . </s>
The men could start getting the message that they have to retool themselves , that the factories that their fathers worked for are not going to be there anymore and that they have to do something different , and then we 'll end up in a situation that 's closer to parity . Or you could end up in a situation where it gets worse and worse and worse and the income -- you know , you have a sort of little upper class of people that these guys are talking about that consists of Bill Gates and maybe the people in this audience and not very many more people and everybody else is sort of struggling with the women holding the bag , it 's called the last bag theory where the woman because she 's raising the child is also going to school and making the money and the men are just sort of struggling and out of work . I would just add to that , the bigger problem I think for men is the unwillingness to take what have been viewed as classically female jobs , teachers , nurses , or healthcare professionals , et cetera , and that 's the area where if you want to talk about how do we make this better , how do we end -- how do we reverse men being finished , which they are -- -- how do we reverse that ? </s>
Well , part of it has got to be that men are going to have to start accepting some of these jobs that have not been classically viewed as male . And I mean think about -- Oh , may I say something that I -- -- think about the Ben Stiller movie where he plays a male nurse , right , and everyone 's like well he 's a male nurse , ha , ha . </s>
About six miles , seven miles from here is a high school called Aviation High School , and it 's got 2,000 students approximately , you go into that school , whereas at most schools , kids are detached and not paying attention , at Aviation they are enthralled . You walk into that high school and you think all the kids are gone because it 's so quiet . </s>
It 's the quietest place in New York City . It 's there the kids have to do academic courses , but they can spend half the day working on airplanes . They build mainframes and so forth . </s>
Now it has one defect . It’s 87 percent male . And so the women’s lobby in Washington has put it on a hit list . Aviation High School has one of the best graduation rates . </s>
Most of the kids going there are from -- their African American and Hispanic kids living under the poverty line , and their chances of graduating are vastly higher than in any other school , very high college matriculation rate . That is a school that is working , but it now more likely to be investigated rather than replicated . People come to study this school from Finland and Ireland , but in the United States they’re more likely to be visited with a Title 9 lawsuit because we’re not helping young men find jobs that they might find interesting and be suited for . The -- and I’m not talking about feminists . Feminists are -- in my book , I talked about lots of different styles of feminism , and they’re not in favor of this . </s>
This is the Women’s Lobby in Washington , which is carried away with a very hostile agenda and working against helping young men . </s>
That’s the problem . Young men aren’t getting the help . </s>
But how does that not help their argument ? Yes , yes , because what Christina is saying is proof -- -- the system is rigged against them . </s>
They haven’t been defeated . </s>
Yes , because they’re finished . No , no , no . Christina , finish -- let Christina finish the point . No , to say that the system is rigged against them is not to say they’re finished . </s>
It’s saying they’re operating under a very severe handicap . And instead of using all of your creativity and energy to argue for this absurd proposition that men are finished , you should be doing something to alleviate the problem that’s leading to their struggle . </s>
Well , acknowledging that this true would be the first step to helping them . It wouldn’t be that , you know , we would want them to be down -- Look , if men are finished , we’re all finished , so let’s not go there . David Zinczenko . </s>
Well , I -- you know , I was just going to add that it’s kind of silly too to say that men will need to learn how to adopt female characteristics to survive , whether it’s moving into jobs like interior decorating or health care providing or these counselors . I mean , I think that Sigmund Freud and Nate Berkus and Dr. Christian Bernard would disagree with the assertion . The guys are moving too -- The men will be unemployed . I mean , it’s a simple choice . </s>
They will remain then unemployed . </s>
In a world where men do , say , fill the positions of school teachers and nurses such as they don’t now , in the vision that you’re saying would be the solution , would they still be dominant ? Well , look , the bottom line is dominance . How do we define that ? I will tell you that health care will become a dominant industry . </s>
It’s becoming -- it already is -- but it’s becoming an even more dominant industry in our country and in our world . If men are simply saying “I’m not playing in that industry , ” and women are saying “I’ll play in any industry , I don’t care what it is . I’m going to do what it takes to make it work , ” then men are going to be at a distinct advantage and are going to remain finished . But this also gets to the heart of the problem . </s>
I mean , historically what’s happened is that women have operated pretty flexibly . They’ve gone in a very short period of time from not being able to work when they were married to not being able to work when they had little kids , to being able to work whenever they wanted in a vast number of professions . I can name a number of professions that have gone from entirely male to entirely female . And you can’t name any that have gone the other way around . </s>
Why ? Because men operate in a narrower range at this point in time . That doesn’t mean that they always will , but at this point in time , they’re just not that flexible about their identities . </s>
Okay . I want to come to the audience for questions shortly , but first I want to mention this , as I mentioned before . We’re very pleased to have Slate as our media partner , and they’re streaming this debate -- thank you . And they’re live streaming this debate on their site , and we have a question from a William Nitrous of New York City who I’m going to slightly paraphrase . He’s saying is this just a natural consequence -- I’m thinking what he means to say is this perception that perhaps men are finished , is it just a natural consequence of the assumption of superiority among men who , unlike females , didn’t have the pressure of needing a college degree to succeed ? </s>
And the more interesting part of his question , he says , “Does this apply outside of America ? ” </s>
So I want to put to both sides the cultural aspect of that question . To what degree are we talking about an American phenomenon here and to what degree is it more global ? Well , men are languishing academically throughout the world . </s>
In most countries in Europe , far more women go to college -- I mean , more women go to college than men in Iran , so it’s not only the United States . But what’s true is that the United States , we’re having a hard time finding ways to help young men . Hanna Rosin . Men are languishing in all countries of the world . </s>
Academically . Academically , their language -- Oh , no , no , not politically , no way . </s>
Well , what -- you know , so here 's an interesting statistic . So we always think -- male preference is something that comes up a lot . You know , preference for the first born son . One of the first things I did when I started this research was , on a lark and a tip , I went to go visit fertility clinics because , you know , we all understand that people prefer sons . </s>
And it turns out that , no , 75 percent of couples are actually requesting girls . So then I started to ask , well , is this true in these very patriarchal places like South Korea , China and India ? </s>
Well , you look at the charts , and here 's what happened . At some point , technology allowed them , you know , to easily choose a son . And then by the mid '90s , this plummeted . Women started to go to school . </s>
Women started to get jobs that they could never have before . And all these strict patriarchal structures started to break down . </s>
So you can see all over the world that different things are happening . </s>
I mean , China , for example , has a higher percentage of female CEOs than the U.S. does . Why ? I think it 's because childcare is easier . I think it 's because families take care of children . </s>
There 's all sorts of reasons why culturally that 's true . Chinese men finished ? Eventually . Okay , let 's go -- no , take it , Christina , go ahead . I’m sorry , do you think that Americans prefer to have female children ? </s>
Well , the difference is when you poll them and ask them what they want , they say we want a son . </s>
When they actually choose , they choose girls . It 's amazing . This is the consistent theme again -- No , no . Wrong , wrong , wrong , because she 's overlooking something . </s>
When they actually choose , you 're talking about women who go to fertility clinics . </s>
But that 's the only place that keeps statistics . </s>
But -- but -- Fertility clinics have to write down for the FDA exactly what everybody else -- exactly what everybody does . And they keep the only reliable statistics . I mean , you can ask them , well , what do people want , and they 'll say a certain thing . But -- </s>
But it 's mostly -- -- it 's not recorded . That 's kind of -- that 's led by women and slightly older women and the Gallup Poll kept records for -- since 1941 , and you found a distinct preference for males . </s>
It has n't changed since 1941 . That 's what people say . It 's just not what they do . Okay . </s>
But let 's go to the audience for some questions now . What you do is , if you raise your hand , I 'll find you . Wait until -- please stand up . A microphone will be brought to you . Hold the microphone about a fist 's distance away from your mouth so that the radio can hear you . </s>
And identify yourself . And if you 're part of a relevant organization , you know what I mean by that , or news organization , please let us know . We 'd just like to know that . And please make it a question that 's terse , focused and on topic and that has a question mark at the end . </s>
You did n't have to sit down because I was making that long speech . </s>
Hello . My name Alicia Bonner , and I am a graduate of a girl 's high school , a women 's college . </s>
And I earn a percent more than my fiancé . I am interested in a couple of the things that David and Christina posed and hearing , Dan and Hanna , your responses . David , you spoke about financial inequality and how -- whatever , 92 percent of the world 's resources are in the hands of men and X percent of the countries in the world are governed by men . Christina , you seem to allude to the fact that anything that women are able to do , it 's because men are there to earn money to fund it , which I think might be a little bit more problematic . </s>
But Dan , you also mentioned that people on the whole -- Could -- I 'm getting there . </s>
-- focus it to a question shortly . The -- the -- they say that , um , you know , they say , yes , I like the way women sound , but I like male news casters better . </s>
How do we overcome this , yes in the middle class , you know , women -- women are holding the bag , as you say . But at the upper level , at the most visible levels , and if money talks , when is that power going to lie with women ? </s>
Yeah , take it , Dan Abrams , first . </s>
I think that eventually the results are going to speak for themselves . </s>
When people start thinking about and hearing about and learning about how much more effective female political leaders are , for example , I think that there will be a change . People will vote differently . Remember , when people say to me , well , why are there so many -- look , women should be blaming themselves with regard to voting because women are the majority of the voters out there . But what 's interesting is , when you get more female candidates , you do n't necessarily get a change with regard to the voting habits of women . So the answer to your question , is I think when it comes to newscasters , when it comes to political leaders , and I think in a lot of these other areas , in finance , I think that ultimately the results will speak for themselves . </s>
And that 's part of the reason why I think this proposition of men are finished -- you know , while certainly hyperbole , if you look at the results , it 's a dangerous world upcoming , not today , a dangerous world coming for men . Other side ? David ? </s>
I mean , I think buildings are always going to fall down . Things are going to burn . You 're always going to need men to get in there and do the dirty jobs , do the dangerous jobs . The world is becoming more dangerous than ever . I think that a lot of the leaders of the world as we discussed are men . </s>
And I think the -- you have to get the country running right here first . You have to focus on health and wellness . I think that universal healthcare is a step in the right direction . </s>
Men and women are partners . And once that happens , but it 's a long ways away right now , you 're right , it 's 16 percent of women are in Congress . 16 percent of women are serving on the board of corporations . </s>
So there 's a lot of work that needs to be done . But we have to do it together . And that 's -- and we have to do it here first . </s>
Okay . Sir ? You 're holding two fingers up . Yep . To Dan and Hanna , even as women take over , if you will -- and I agree the trends are there . There 's no question about it -- would n't there be inevitably a sort of market adjustment whereby men will learn from women how to be better CEOs , how to be better political leaders , better administrators , better members of society and that ultimately , it wo n't mean that anybody 's finished , but that there will be a balancing and an improvement . </s>
Christina , why do n't you take that first , and then we 'll come to the other side . Christina Hoff Sommers . Yes , I do n't disagree that there is going to be transformation . </s>
This debate is not about whether or not we 're in a period of transformation and men 's and women 's roles are changing . Of course they are . So I 'm not contesting that . What I 'm contesting is this very aggressive , dramatic resolution , defended by my colleagues that men are finished . So I pose that . </s>
But as far as men improving , I think they will . I think -- Hanna Rosin . -- they always have had -- face challenges and -- and hard times and overcome them , and they will do the same now . </s>
Hanna Rosin . That 's the best-case scenario , and that 's what I wish would happen . </s>
However , like I said , there 's just all this evidence that men do n't respond that well and are not that flexible . People , like she says , people have measured things for many , many years about male preference . People have measured male feelings about male identity . </s>
Now , female feelings about what 's okay as a woman , and people have measured this for college students and adults have changed radically . Women now think it 's much more okay to be aggressive in the workplace . </s>
It 's much more okay to win . They ask a series of questions . The male identification has n't -- self-identification has n't changed basically in 60 years . </s>
Men always think it 's only acceptable to be a guy in this tiny , narrow range . And they 're always defining themselves against women , not towards women , where women are always doing the opposite , which is they 're defining themselves as more aggressive , competitive , et cetera . Why ? I do n't know why . I do n't know if that 's biology or what . </s>
But that 's just how it is . So we would hope so , but we do n't know . Sir , right in the aisle there . And I just want to mention that if you 're in an area where you ca n't see the numbers on your wristwatch , I ca n't see you because you 're -- the lights are n't bright enough . </s>
So that if you are in that area where it 's darker , and you want to ask a question , if you could move down , I might have a chance to find you . Sir , go ahead . Can you identify yourself ? My name is Aaron , and the group that I am a part of is men with a bachelor 's degree . </s>
That 's the relevant group that I 'm a part of . Bachelor 's degree , by the way , may be overdue for a name change . But -- </s>
I ca n't believe we never thought of that before . I think you deserve a round of applause for that . Wow . I was n't planning to start the standup comedy till next week . </s>
I look at this , I see a man and a woman -- a man and a woman , but one style of debate here , one style of debate here . And I 'm -- and it just seems that men are finished is just an unfortunate title since both groups seem to be saying it 's more about traits . And so my question is , is it -- could it be more men who have more feminine traits , who -- or traditionally feminine traits , who are succeeding . And I 'm thinking of people like Bill Gates or Mark Zuckerberg , and are succeeding for that reason . </s>
Could they then potentially reverse the trend and be more successful than women because there are the -- What are the feminine traits , though , that you would have in mind ? Well , I 'm just -- what they 've been saying , that women pay attention more , they 're more patient , they 're better at certain things . Okay . All right . </s>
I hear your question then . Why do n't we take it first to Dan Abrams . Just so I understand , what -- do I -- I think your question is , if more men could be more like women -- Yeah , look . </s>
There 's -- no , no , no , no . That 's actually a fair point . Look , I 'll take that serious . </s>
I do n't mean to -- You want to ask anything else ? Well , I -- No , no , go ahead , just take it then because -- </s>
It 's not men acting more like women just because they want to act like women or learning to act like women , it 's men who do by nature -- like I feel like people told me that I have traits that are more like a woman personality-wise , not physically and my voice -- Not your hair , it 's not your hair they 're talking about . -- but just a matter of -- and men are already in the positions of power and then men in positions of power who want to keep men in power change the rules of the game or in some way -- but ultimately yes , men with more feminine traits succeeding because people are embracing more feminine traits , okay . I 'll say this , that in the world of finance there is a clear recognition that the traders need to behave more classically female , meaning that they are now being trained at many classically male financial firms to engage in behavior , consensus building , less of the sort of typically male buying and trading like crazy , taking risks , and becoming a bit more risk averse , et cetera , to improve long term performance . Again , getting back to some of the statistics that I laid out , that 's as a result of risk aversion , now , that does n't -- that means if you 're going to swing for the homerun every time , you 're going to hit that homerun more often and you 're also going to strike out more often . </s>
And yet if you behave more in what is viewed as classically female , more risk averse , you 're going to end up with more -- and to use the sports analogy -- singles , doubles , and triples , and as a result have better returns , so just -- David , do you want to respond to that ? I think you 're a superior human being who is adapting , that 's exactly what 's going on . You are adopting certain traits that will help you survive and excel . There is nothing wrong with that . </s>
What is unfortunate is the argument can not -- of women gaining traction , which they 're trying to make this about , is not what in fact the debate is about , which is men are n't finished . And -- Right , I was talking about surpassing them , not equaling them , surpassing them . Yes , and maybe -- look , I can sit here and talk about the ratio of college-educated men to women in Birmingham being 13 to 17 and in Oakland 11 to eight , we can talk about stats all day long . But if you come back to the facts , the main facts when it comes to how wealth is distributed , the fact that men are still earning more than women , that they 're still running boards , running countries , inventing new technologies , you are in a situation where men are n't finished , and that 's why you have to vote against this motion . </s>
Yeah , right there with this -- yeah , I 'm looking right at you . And just wait for the mic . Something for Dave and then one question for the panel , but you mentioned that men still hold the majority of resources , 99 percent and they run 92 percent of the countries , do you honestly think that 's because they 're more competent ? </s>
I mean , why do you think that is ? Do you think it has something to do with deeply rooted structural patriarchy that 's been enforced through violence over the past 40,000 years , like -- -- and then one more question for the whole panel -- Wait on that one because -- I 'm sorry . -- because nobody will remember the two , and that was a pretty good one . It 's a quick one , it 's just -- </s>
No , hold off , I 'll come back to you for the second one and -- but let this one go and then -- but I 'll come back . Go ahead , David . Yeah , look , I think that men have had an enormous head start . That 's what I 'm arguing . </s>
I am for gender equality . I am just saying men are n't finished . You know , and I -- And that 's why you have to vote against the motion . And that 's why you have to vote against the motion . </s>
We have to stay very focused here . And look , I think one of the things -- so men have had a tremendous head start , that 's worldwide , the gains they 've made , certainly women have made enormous gains and will continue to make them , and we should support all of them , but it 's not what we 're debating here tonight . </s>
And it 's funny the point that Hanna made about Men 's Health as a lose your gut type magazine . Well , let 's get back to that for one second , okay ? This right here is the world 's leading women 's magazine , okay , right here . </s>
For the radio audience , tell us what you 're holding up right now . This is “Cosmopolitan , ” okay , which just happens to be the world’s leading women’s magazine . </s>
I think they’re in like 97 countries or something . Left side , naughty -- 21 naughty sex tips , bold breathless moves . </s>
Wait , so why do you want to be like that ? Shrink your inner thighs in six minutes a day . Times he wants you to be jealous . Four words that seduce any man any time . </s>
This magazine is concerned -- it seems like women are concerned a lot with men , okay . Then we go over to a magazine like “Men’s Health , ” -- -- which also happens to be the world’s largest men’s magazine . And now , here you have gym-free abs -- You know this is a non-profit organization . Get ripped workout , you know , Torn to Shreds : The Untold Story of the Afghanistan War . </s>
So why don’t we -- we’ve just proved that men are obsessed with themselves , and women are obsessed with men . I’m sorry , women -- Let me come back to your second question and make it very short because I’d like to move on to -- go back , this whole conversation also has been very binary between men and women . </s>
And I was curious , for everyone and maybe for Hanna who’s done so much on-the-ground reporting , also , where like gender non-conforming people and trans people fit into this conversation ? Well , they -- you know , I mean , one thing that we all wish for is for men to accept a broader range of self identities . So in the sense that , you know , it’s much more acceptable to be gay now , no , there’s no problem with being gay . You know , gay people can get married , they can not get married , that maybe holds up a world in which it’s okay for a wide range , like it’s okay for a guy to be a stay-at-home dad . </s>
There’s a new sitcom about a guy who’s a stay-at-home dad and maybe you should watch it , you know . </s>
Maybe more guys will become stay-at-home dads . So you don’t have to feel like super self-conscious if you’re a guy whose wife , for example , makes more money than you do , which is a -- which is now almost 30 percent of the population , which , again , was unheard of only , you know , 20 years ago is now fairly common . And you don’t have to like slink away in shame if that is you . </s>
Okay , I need to do another radio break , so I’d just like to ask you to applaud again , and I’ll come back and -- So we are in the middle of a question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I’m John Donvan , your moderator . We have four debaters , two teams of two . And they are debating this motion , `` Men are finished . '' </s>
And I want to do one more time without the applause to give them that option . So we’re in the middle of the Q and A section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I’m John Donvan of ABC News , your moderator . We have four debaters , two teams of two , debating this motion , `` Men are finished . '' So let’s go to another question . Sir , you’ve got a white card in your hand . </s>
Thank you . But one thing I want to say . The two-part questions are driving me nuts and long , long premises are driving me nuts , so just write out the question . Thanks . It’s very brief . </s>
Okay . My name is Jay Searson . I’m one of the few men in that own- your-own-company , entrepreneurial category , so I’m not finished , I think . So I’d like to point out , Ms. Rosin , your whole point seems to be , you know , you’re arguing that what we have now is the beginning of a trend . </s>
So , suppose that just before Tom Edison invents the light bulb , all the candlestick makers are Irishmen . After Edison invents the light bulb , all those candlestick-making jobs go away , and things look pretty bad for the Irish . But nobody would say that it’s the end of Irishmen . </s>
It’s the end of candlestick makers . And we’ve just had a housing bubble that eliminated a ton of construction jobs . And those construction jobs were overwhelmingly male because men actually had a genetic advantage doing construction . It requires heavy lifting . </s>
Okay , okay , okay . So why is it a trend -- One more sentence from your mouth and have a question mark at the end . Because you’ve got a good point , but focus it . </s>
That’s the question . </s>
Why is it a trend ? I think I got it . I got it , I got it . </s>
Okay . Okay , so in the first recession , that’s what we thought . </s>
We thought , “Oh , it’s just the end of construction jobs.” And then in the second recession , we thought , “Oh , it’s just the end of , you know , pipeline fitter jobs , ” and then we thought it’s just the end of this and the end of that . And then suddenly we realized , no , it’s actually the end of the manufacturing era . </s>
So you realize that this was a trend that was not going to go away or reverse itself and that all these jobs that men happened to do were sort of shrinking and shrinking and shrinking . And they were never going to come back . So , you know , I don’t know -- you want me to say it’s like the end of manufacturing -- Let’s hear from your opponents . Christina ? </s>
First of all , I just don’t accept the idea that men , the jobs that men will hold in the future are going to be -- they’re going to have to be dance therapists or executive producers . If you look at the projections from the labor department , we 're going to need vast -- millions and millions of engineers and people that are experts in information technology . And there are still going to have to be people constructing and manufacturing . </s>
So it 's naive to suggest that we 're moving away entirely from jobs that were conventionally done by men . And I just want to go back to one question that was raised before about where do transgendered people and gay people fit in . It was actually -- a lot of my positions about men and women came from sympathy that I had for transgendered and gay people , people that did n't fit into their gender role , because one of the things they tell us is that your gender role is very powerful . And it 's not socially constructed . It 's something you are born with . </s>
And what I urge in my writing is to be respectful , yes , of people who defy the stereotypes of their gender , but also to be respectful of those of us who embody the stereotypes . </s>
There are many people who are -- -- conventionally fem -- Yep . He wants -- Did you want to -- </s>
I would just say I completely agree with the point about trends . They 're called trends for a reason . </s>
They do n't last forever . </s>
That 's why we 're not all walking around -- No , they 're called trends because they 're true . </s>
But it misses the point , which is that the more important point , directly responding to your question about the candlesticks , is that what we 're seeing in society today , and Hanna has studied a lot more than have I , is the idea that the people who are making candles and engaging in jobs that are becoming outdated or whatever the case may be , women have figured out a way to navigate the tough economy better than men . </s>
And they are simply adapting better than are men . And that 's the really important point here . It 's not just that the male jobs are being eliminated . Yes . Thank you . </s>
Yes , hi . Hello . Diane Salvatore , editor of Prevention magazine . </s>
Is it true that -- that men with power and money tend to self-destruct more than women do ? And I think here of Oprah versus Charlie Sheen . </s>
Or how about anybody versus Charlie Sheen ? That 's why I said before that Dan is probably finished , but not others . I 'm just thankful to you for mentioning Charlie Sheen because I feel like you just say `` Charlie Sheen '' enough times , and everybody will vote for us . </s>
Sir , I 'm looking right at you . If you stand up -- yep . Michael , come in , please . </s>
Thank you . That was a question . </s>
That was a focused question . That 's the model . </s>
By a woman . All right . I 'm going to try and redeem the men 's side with this question . You spoke earlier about bloggers versus loggers . </s>
I guess everybody would agree that technology is the new frontier . And if you look at Silicon Valley , it 's dominated by young men . </s>
What do you say to that ? Well , whenever I look at these -- Hanna Rosin . </s>
-- questions , because we always think , oh , men are better at technology . They 're better engineers . </s>
I do , in my head what I call the cross-border biology check . Now , what is a cross-border biology check ? I try and think , okay , is this just something we think is true because we look at it , and we assume it ever has to be true , while in India , half of engineering students are women . Now , why is that ? Because it 's encouraged in India , and because that 's something everybody has to do . </s>
It 's not something that men are necessarily better than women at . </s>
So I just feel like eventually that will be true here too . We put an emphasis on it , and women will do it . Correction about India ? In countries like -- people often say , Look at India , look at Malaysia . </s>
Women are the engineers , and far more women are becoming physicists . In those countries , women do n't have as much choice of what they do . Because of economic pressures , they are forced to do careers in a society where there 's more prosperity , women have more choice , and they go into other fields . And that 's why if you look at what American women are majoring in it 's art history and education , all sorts of things . </s>
They 're not forced to do something they do n't want to do . Men do . </s>
That is their number one choice in college majors , or it 's -- of all the majors , that 's the one men choose , I guess , after business . Whereas women , it 's teaching . So there are -- there are differences in that , again , I am insisting that we need both in the new economy . Right here , second row . </s>
A mic 's going to come for you . Second -- third stand . I 'm sorry . </s>
I meant -- sorry . All right . </s>
I just wanted to clarify some things . The debate 's title is called `` Men are finished . '' </s>
And it seems that all four of you agree and disagree on different points on how to interpret that . </s>
So can you -- can each panelist give some examples on the representative man and the representative woman that they think is defining these new trends ? It 's a good question . It will take a half an hour . So I 'm going to respectfully pass , but not to disrespect the question . </s>
I just think it would chew up too much time and maybe not get us to a new place . So if you could pass to your -- see , by being persistent -- Yes . Hello . My name is David , and I am a student here at NYU . </s>
And I 'm male . But I just wanted to ask , because I 've seen that a lot of the debate has been going on about what is considered traditionally male or traditionally female . And I was wondering if it was really possible to determine whether or not men are , quote , unquote , `` finished , '' based on these traditional sort of stereotypical characteristics , because if you look at it , what is considered traditionally female is not what they 're right now . Like the female workers in business or economics or whatever tend to have more what we consider traditionally male traits . </s>
So a man going into nursing you feel would be going into a female profession ? Well , I would say that it 's what’s considered traditionally female . But I think what we consider traditionally male or female -- </s>
So -- -- so iss not really whole . So if you focus your question down to one sentence , what , what is it ? </s>
All right . Is it -- is it really possible to say that men are finished based on what we consider to be traditionally male and female -- considering the fact that in modern times the definitions of said genders -- That the world is changing . I think I see what he 's saying . </s>
Can the lady from Prevention magazine reformulate that ? Hanna Rosin , do you want to take it ? -- formulate that ? Who would like to take that ? </s>
Well , there is some evidence -- Hanna Rosin . </s>
-- that as women become more dominant , they take on more traits that we think of as traditionally masculine . So I think that a lot of these things are much more fluid than we think they are . That 's why I 'm always reluctant to enter into this gender biology question : Women are like this , and men are like this . Women have gotten vastly more aggressive . </s>
They are -- they 're much , much more likely to get arrested , especially juvenile females than they were 20 years ago . You know , so this is a sort of scale that moves along a continuum . Okay . Though , as I said -- </s>
I 'm guessing you will agree with that . So , sir -- Well -- No ? One thing she 's left out . </s>
Okay . Go on . Okay , no , no , no . Christina , if you 're serious , go ahead . Well , it 's one thing that does not change in human nature is that men tend to succeed and fail more spectacularly than females . </s>
So you find more males who are , in any economy , any situation , there are going to be males that are going to find their way to the top . And there will be males that will find their way to the bottom . Right . </s>
Men have that -- that capacity . That was Dan Abrams homerun -- swinging for the fence point . Sir , you 're standing in the aisle ? Yes . </s>
You just pointed to yourself . Yeah , that 's -- No , that 's not -- that 's me being confused , not him , all right ? Thank you . </s>
This is a point first made by Slate magazine 's Emily Bazelon who I think it was -- or what I heard is I think it 's appropriate to do it here where you 're a cosponsor . But the company Wal-Mart recently faced a lawsuit about systematically discriminating against women and whatever you think about the outcome of that . The point was , clearly Wal-Mart was n't utilizing their -- or empowering their female work force . </s>
And all the economic evidence which Wal-Mart would have definitely had at its disposal would suggest that that would be the profit maximizing thing to do . And we all know Wal-Mart loves profit . So I guess my question for the panel is , why is that , and what does that mean for our motion ? You know , I think it 's a little -- I think it 's a little bit off point on getting us to the question of whether we think men are finished or not , so respectfully , I 'm going to pass on that . But I could just reformulate it . </s>
But I -- I -- I would just like to ask , why do n't all of our leading companies , if they were really smart , fire all their males who are useless and hire females ? Well , they do n't -- </s>
Well , they 're not saying that they 're useless . </s>
They have n't gone that far . They 're not useless , but they 're on their way out . </s>
Okay . So you want to answer that ? Yeah . I mean , they do n't have to fire all of their males , but they certainly have to -- -- fire most of them . </s>
Thank you . No , that 's not where I was going with that . Right there in the aisle , to your right , right , yes . Could you please rise . </s>
Thanks . </s>
The moderator started out by saying that increasing -- Leslie Bennetts , Newsweek Daily Beast . The moderator started out by saying that increasingly men are not assuming the responsibilities of parenthood . Both the men on the panel who are middle aged , single and childless would be examples of this . And I 'd like to know why they think that this is so often the case these days , men are marrying less and less . Men are not supporting their families . </s>
The statistics on the nonpayment of things like child support are astronomical . And that 's always been one of the hallmarks of adulthood . I 'd like to know what the panel has to say about that . </s>
Since I 'm being lumped in with dead beat dads , I think I 'll probably pass on this one . I 'm not touching that . I have three children . </s>
I just like to brag about that . I 'm not going near that one . Dave and Dan , you can take that one . </s>
David Zinczenko . Well , I mean , I -- you know , obviously you 're well-read and you 've probably read the Times today and the piece about how single men or unmarried men are sometimes the biggest contributors to their family and in their community , so -- -- statistically there 's a lot of evidence -- </s>
If you 're going to come back , it 's okay to do so , but could you stand up again ? </s>
Yeah . Sure . Statistically there 's a lot of evidence and I 'm really curious about why you guys think that men are turning away from -- you know , I mean , a generation or two ago by the time men were in their late 20s they often had three or four kids . That 's not the model today . I 'm interested in what the men have to say about -- </s>
But women are also having -- but women are also having children later , I mean , it 's not a male-female . Yeah , but a lot of women are having children alone because men do n't want to participate . Yeah , no , if we look at -- Okay . Or because -- </s>
-- if we look at this from the children 's perspective and the children in this sort of 59 percent that I was talking about , we would definitely win and you would definitely have to vote for men are finished . It 's like a shocking phenomenon , 40 percent of American children are now born to single parent households . You could say that 's because the women have decided that the men are finished , they do n't need them , they do n't contribute to the household , the women are the ones doing all the work and going to school and the men are just sort of another child in the house to feed and that 's what all the women tell me . I wish that it was funny but it 's not funny . </s>
That 's the part of this that 's the tragedy about men are finished . One last question , sir . Well , my background is in the apparel industry . </s>
I was the largest employer in the State of Tennessee , and the largest employer in the State of Maryland , and the largest employer in Alabama , all women sewing apparel . And we had to train women managers , and we made a major effort to do that . So what 's your question then ? My education is business school where there was one woman in a class of 800 when I went -- </s>
Right , but I 'd like you to get to a question , sir . What we need to do is be sure that women are taught how to manage large groups of people and then they will get the important jobs , not just do the work , and we have n't done that , now how can we make more women managers , not just family managers , but managers of businesses , service businesses , and manufacturing businesses , most of which in my industry worked overseas ? Okay , I 'm not sure that , that 's getting to our question of what do we do for the men , which I think is a little bit more on point . </s>
There are women managers -- there -- 54 percent of American managers are now women , they do n't need that much help on that . </s>
I 'm going to take one more question , right down in front with . I just have a quick question . Does anybody have the statistics on how many men become women and how many women become men ? </s>
It 's -- that 's a whole ‘nother debate which we 're going to have shortly . All right . Folks , really , really , I think it has been so clear and all instances about how to do this . </s>
Sir , can you stand up ? That 's one of the parts -- My question is , can you imagine being a cofounder or founder of an island where only women live on this island ? </s>
Okay , I 'm going to go to another -- Yes , I can , but -- </s>
I have an answer . I sometimes do , but -- right down front . Someone did ask the question , what would it be like if women ran the world and the reply was there would be no more war , just lots of jealous countries refusing to speak to one another . </s>
Okay , can you rise ? And make this a -- give us a finish here . </s>
Because you might be our last question . Although it 's true that women have been earning more bachelor 's degrees , how significant of a point is that when women are still doing two thirds of the work in the world and earning 10 percent of the income and owning less than one percent of the property ? And that 's directed towards Hanna and Dan . Okay , again , it 's not on our topic about men . </s>
Somebody , hear me , hear me . You got it ? Men are not finished . You got it ? </s>
Hello ? </s>
Front row , sorry , please , do n't make me regret choosing you . </s>
I 'm a do you proud , I 'm a do you proud . </s>
My question is for Christina . You were speaking earlier about how in elementary school it 's designed against boys . Sometimes , yes , very often . </s>
Well , you were emphasizing how dire it was that we have to change that and we have to help boys . Right . In doing so , are you conceding that if something does n't change , then men are finished ? Yes . </s>
Christina , take that question . </s>
First of all , men -- that 's ridiculous , men are not finished . And that’s why you should vote against the proposition . No , but -- No , what I’m saying is we have set up an obstacle course for young men that makes it -- and we’re doing a much better job educating young women , supporting young women , encouraging young women . </s>
There is -- every scintilla of evidence suggests it . </s>
So what we have to do is find a way and , yes , it goes back to the elementary school classroom where we have to support boys . Now am I saying that means men are finished ? No , I don’t see how you hear that . I’m saying we’ve set up handicaps . </s>
We’ve set up obstacles . Yes , and unless we change and get rid of those handicaps , men are finished . No , false . Wrong , illogical . I’ll give you one statistic , patents . </s>
I’ve got to get my brother to sit down . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , ladies and gentlemen , that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
And here’s where we are . We are about to hear closing statements from each debater in turn . They will be two minute each . And remember how you voted before the debate . Right after these closing statements , we’re going to ask you once again to vote . </s>
And the team that has changed your minds -- most of your minds in the course of this debate -- I’m going to say that again . And the team that has most of your minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner . </s>
So , onto round three , closing statements . Our motion is this , `` Men are finished . '' And here to summarize his position again , her position -- and here to summarize her position against the motion , Christina Hoff Sommers , resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and author of “The War Against Boys.” </s>
I urge you to vote against this proposition for three reasons . Number one , it’s false . Okay , women are not replacing men . </s>
Women are not becoming the first sex . Women are becoming partners with men . Men continue to do most of the arduous and dangerous work , and they are the primary risk-takers and innovators . Society is driven by what the classical economist Joseph Schumpeter called “the gale of creative destruction.” </s>
Women can cause such gales , but it has always been a masculine specialty , and there is zero evidence that that is changing . </s>
Now as I said in my earlier remarks , men have been doing less well in the classroom , but this does not herald the end of men . Rather , it means that we have to find ways of making our schools more effective for male students . </s>
Reason two you should oppose this proposition : It’s chauvinistic . As I said , in the old days , we had female supremacy . </s>
It’s been replaced by this variety of “women are wonderful” phenomenon . </s>
The battle days of male supremacy are now followed by this female chauvinism . So , I believe that an act in favor of this proposition is a vote for chauvinism . Third and most important , the sexes need each other . </s>
They complement each other . </s>
They have been known to love one another . As Henry Kissinger once said , “No one will ever win the war between the sexes . </s>
There’s just too much fraternizing with the enemy.” Now women and men do not succeed at one another’s expense . We’re on the same team . </s>
We’re co-dependent . That was true on the African Savanna 100,000 years ago . It has been true ever since . It’s true in 21st century America . </s>
You can certainly find times when one sex has acquitted itself better than the other , but you will never find examples of one sex becoming irrelevant . Such a development is beyond anything in human experience . I urge you to vote in favor of reality . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Christina Hoff Sommers . Our motion is `` Men are finished , '' and here to summarize her position in support of this motion , Hanna Rosin , an award-winning journalist for Slate and The Atlantic . </s>
I’m going to start out by reading you a couple of quotes . One is from a story called , “The Decline of the American Male.” </s>
“Men , ” this writer says , “are endangered species . They are expendable.” Another quote : “Women have gained in the past century while men have fallen behind.” Who is this mystery author ? Dave Zinczenko is the mystery author who wrote this story at USA Today in 2009 . </s>
He keeps saying this is preposterous , this is preposterous . </s>
Merely two years ago , he thought that it was true . </s>
Now I’m going to read you another series of quotes . “It is boys who are the second sex . It’s a bad time to be a boy in America . The research” -- listen to this closely -- “commonly cited to support claims of male privilege and male sinfulness is riddled with errors.” Who is the mystery author of this article ? </s>
Christina Hoff Sommers , who’s also saying that this is all very preposterous . So , as you can see , it’s not that preposterous . We can all see the writing on the walls . They keep talking about how men are still running the country . </s>
Men are still doing this , men are still doing that . But that 's not interesting . That just shows a lack of imagination . As we said , this `` Men are finished '' proposition , you literally have to think of it as graffiti , as the writing on the wall pointing to an inevitable future . All the signs are there . </s>
So -- and then the final thing I want to say is , Christina says this is a vote for chauvinism , that `` Men are finished '' is a vote for chauvinism . Do n't think of it that way . You 're actually doing a public service to men if you vote for our team because I think if we finally acknowledge that this is a problem and that men are finished and that they need our help , and they might even need some affirmative action , then maybe we would behave the right way , and we would help the men who desperately need our help . So remember , vote for men are finished . '' Thank you , Hanna Rosin . </s>
Our motion is `` Men are finished . '' </s>
And here to summarize his position against the motion , David Zinczenko , executive vice president and editor in chief of Men 's Health magazine . Well , thank you . Thank you , John . Thank you . Hats off to Dan and Hanna . </s>
That article , by the way , was arguing for better healthcare for men . There are five offices of women 's health in the federal government , zero for men . That was really the context . Now , my opponents tonight have outlined some trends that seem to herald the final decent of the American male into a metaphorical trash heap of irrelevance and impotence . They are trying to bury legions of men alive , okay ? </s>
You have to vote against this measure . </s>
Sure , there are some worrisome trends . They went through them , okay ? And as we all know once a trend starts , it keeps going on forever . That 's why all of our houses are worth so much more today than they were in 2007 . </s>
Now , in the end , there are two reasons why you must vote against this motion , because they might be wrong , but they might be right . Now , the first point , consider this : Gender equality is something , we can all agree on , as an ideal . </s>
But if we are approaching gender equality , why are there fewer women in government today than there were ten years ago ? Why is it so much easier for men to hold onto their gun rights than it is for women to hold onto their reproductive rights ? Not only are n't men finished , but women have n't even begun . </s>
Let 's at least get to the point where the game is tied before we start writing all the men off . Let 's imagine , though , that the trend toward greater female political social and economic power continues unabated . Highly unlikely because the great recession started with men and now it 's starting to hit predominantly female jobs more than before . </s>
And the scales are tilting . </s>
So the more educated independent single women there are the more wonderful the world will actually get for men , okay ? So regardless of whether we one day achieve gender equality , men are not finished . And by the way , women are not either . </s>
You have to vote against this measure . Thank you , David Zinczenko . </s>
Our motion is `` Men are finished . '' And here to summarize his position in support of the motion , Dan Abrams , chief legal analyst for ABC News , author of `` Man Down . '' It seemed at times that our opponents were pleading to you as a moral matter to vote against this . </s>
It would be wrong , be horrible . Look what would happen ? </s>
You would make the guys feel bad . Look , the reality is that we 're not just talking about women catching up . We 're talking about women surpassing men . </s>
Both Hanna and I have talked to you in depth and at length about how significantly women have not caught up but surpassed men in very significant areas in our society . </s>
David mentioned before that you 're not going to see jock strap protests outside . That 's right . </s>
That 's part of the problem is that men are not alarmed by the situation . And that 's one of the main reasons that men are finished , is they do n't seem to care . They think -- they think it 's cool to be a slacker . It 's not . </s>
Dave mentioned the Chilean mines and the miners there as an effort to sort of pull at your heartstrings . There 's no question that that was a heartfelt moment . </s>
But what if a woman had designed that mine ? I 'm guessing that we might not have ever had that sort of problem . I will end with one note from my book which is that there was a study done on how long it takes men and women to get ready to leave the house . And this study , in England , of 2,000 people showed that men take , on average , four minutes longer . </s>
When you think about a Saturday night , no question women will take longer to get ready to leave the house . But when you think about the realities that women face every day of bringing up children , of working a job very often , of doing all the hard work and trying to get ready to leave the house , it starts to make sense . And if that study 's true , then men really are finished . </s>
Thank you , Dan Abrams . And that concludes our closing statements . And now it 's time to learn which side you feel has argued the best . Remember , we 've asked you to vote before the debate began . We 're going to ask you to vote `` against '' now judging the qualities of these arguments . </s>
You go to the keypad at your seat . Our motion is this : `` Men are finished . '' If you agree with the motion or feel that the argument was presented best on that side , you push number one . If you disagree , you push number two . If you remain or became undecided , you push number three . </s>
Yes . Seriously ? One , if you 're for the motion . Two if you 're against . </s>
They 're number one . We’re number 1 , they’re number 2 . That 's a very good way to put it . We 've never done that . And a woman came up with that idea . </s>
Number one , number two , undecided is number three . All right . We 're going to have the results very , very quickly . I want to just talk a little bit about a couple of things that are coming up . </s>
But first I want to thank the debaters for the quality of the arguments that they brought here . And for the unique and difficult to achieve combination of being serious and intelligent while also a lot of fun at the same time . </s>
This is also normally the point in the evening in which I thank the audience for its great questions . And I -- I want to say that it really pleased me to see those neurons firing rapidly , and in some cases randomly . But -- but all of you for having the guts to get up and face this and face what I was doing . In any case , I really appreciate it . </s>
And as an audience , you actually have been spectacular , wonderful and very vocal . </s>
So thank you very much for this evening . We 'd like to thank Slate for being our media partner for live streaming this debate and for bringing questions to us and for being part of this in the future as well . So -- we 're back here again on Tuesday , October 4th . Our next debate has this motion : `` Grandma 's Benefits Imperil Junior 's Future . '' </s>
Arguing in support of this motion , we 'll have Margaret Hoover . She is author of `` American Individualism . '' It 's a political manifesto that evokes her great-grandfather , Herbert Hoover 's , emphasis on the values of civic responsibility . Joining her as her teammate is Mort Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report who wondered , in a recent op ed , how , quote , `` a country of pioneers and self- made men could evolve into a culture of entitlement . '' Arguing against this motion , we 're going to have Howard Dean , former chairman of the Democratic National Committee , six-term governor of Vermont , a physician and one-time candidate for president in 2004 . </s>
And his partner will be Jeff Madrick editor of Challenge magazine and author of `` The Case for Big Government . '' </s>
And that argues -- that says that engaged government , a big government of high taxes and wise regulations is necessary to ensure America 's social and economic security . You can find a full listing of all of our fall debates in tonight 's program and also on our website where tickets are available for purchase . All of our debates , as we 've said already , can be heard on NPR stations across the country , including WNYC here in New York and also watched on WNET 's 13 , WLIW and NJTV . And do n't forget to follow Intelligence Squared U.S. on Twitter and make sure to become a fan of Facebook . </s>
And if you do , you will get a discount on future debates . Okay . I 'm going to announce the results . And I want to do it this way . So these debaters have spent the last hour plus trying to win you over to their point of view on our motion , `` Men are finished . '' </s>
We had you vote once before the debate and once again at the end of the debate . Both of those votes are now in . And here are the results . Before the debate , with the motion being , `` Men are finished , '' 20 percent were for the motion , 54 percent were against , and 26 percent undecided . After the debate , 66 percent are for the motion . </s>
That 's up 46 percent . 29 percent are against . That is down 25 percent . </s>
5 percent undecided . That 's down 21 percent . The side arguing for the motion , `` Men are finished , '' has carried our debate . Our congratulations to them . </s>
Thank you from me , John Donvan , and Intelligence Squared U.S. , we 'll see you next time . </s>
Well— welcome everyone to another debate from Intelligence Squared US , I’m John Donvan of ABC News , and once again it is my honor and pleasure to be serving as moderator as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University , six debaters , three against three , will be debating this motion , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” Now , normally at this point in the evening the chairman of Intelligence Squared , Robert Rosenkranz , who is also chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , takes to the stage , and he briefly outlines what’s before us , what our debate really is about and what the issues are . Unfortunately he has taken ill this evening so we will not be hearing from him and we wish him well . I’ll just say very briefly , in terms of the drug war—that language has been around a long time , it’s 40 years this year that Richard Nixon first declared a war on drugs in the United States . </s>
Mexico launched its war on drugs three years ago , the difference is , that in Mexico it really is a war , as we think of war . </s>
It involves troops , and grenades and bombs and bullets , and it has come at a huge cost of 10,000 lives lost . The question before us is whether the United States has some responsibility to bear for this , given the fact that the United States serves as such a large market for narcotics , the question is also raised , whether there would be a war at all , whether the cartels could arm themselves but for the supply of illicit weapons from the United States . Are we in essence , responsibility for those 10,000 deaths . That is the question before us but we’re putting it in this form , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” </s>
I want to remind everyone this is not a panel discussion or a seminar , this is a debate , it’s a contest , there will be winners and losers . And you in our audience will be the judges , you will pick the winners , you will have voted twice by the time the debate begins , once before , and once again after the debate . And the team that moves the most voters , that changes the most minds , will be declared our winner . Now let’s go to the preliminary vote , before the debate begins . And turn to the keypad at your left side… There’s a range of numbers , but you only need to concern yourselves with numbers 1 , 2 , or 3 . </s>
If you agree with the motion , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” push number 1 , if you disagree , push number 2 , and if you are undecided…push number 3 . If you make a mistake , just correct it , and the system will lock in your last response . All right , I will have those results fairly shortly , but we’re going to move on now , so— On to our debate and on to Round 1 , opening statements from each of the debaters , seven minutes each , uninterrupted . </s>
And , speaking first , for the motion , Fareed Zakaria , who— and if there are people out there still who doubt that an intellectual can also be popular in the United States , Fareed Zakaria is that example , he is the host— Fareed , you can make your way to the microphone—he is the host of “Fareed Zakaria , GPS” on CNN and Fareed , I’m certain that has nothing to do with getting directions off the highway . What does the “GPS” stand for ? “Global Public Square.” </s>
“Global Public Square , ” how appropriate for this , ladies and gentlemen , Fareed Zakaria . Thank you very much , it’s such a pleasure to be here . You know , I feel very comfortable , I have to say , at the outset with the opposing team , sharing a podium with people with very different views about drugs , immigration , Mexico , because , my show at CNN is actually taped in the same studios as Lou Dobbs’s . </s>
So I shared— I shared studio space with Lou Dobbs , I can share a platform with you gentlemen , I’m delighted to do so . Look , what I thought I would do is try to convince you as best I can , that you should vote for this proposition . And , we are on the 40th anniversary of the drug war . The war on drugs was declared by Richard Nixon , and it began a vast effort by the United States government , to transform the issue of drugs into one about criminality and war . And it began a massive program in the United States that has spread throughout the region . </s>
The results are in , 40 years out , I would argue . We have spent about $ 1 trillion . That does not count by the way what local and state governments spend every year , to enforce the war on drugs , which is $ 41 billion . </s>
Every year . Now , if you look at any metric , I would argue , that would be reasonable to apply the availability of drug use , the potency of drugs , for the most part the price—the metrics suggest the drug war has failed , it has done nothing to dampen demand , it has perhaps in many ways increased potency , and certainly increased criminality . So , if you look at the simplest statistic in terms of what the effect of this vast war on drugs has had over the last 40 years . In the 1970s , the United States had the same incarceration rate , as every other country in the world . </s>
We were about at the world average in terms of how many people we imprisoned , as a percentage of our population . </s>
That rate today , is five times the world average . In 1980 , those blissful , halcyon days of 1980 , we had 41,000 people in prison on drug-related charges . Today we have 500,000 people . </s>
So , if you ask yourself , what the effect in the United States has been it seems to me plain , it is blindingly obvious . The question , I suppose , we have to then ask ourselves is what is the effect outside the United States , because there has been another effect of this war on drugs , which has been to internationalize the problem . </s>
Because we began this process , by interdicting in Miami , and then started moving to the sources , because the sources also started fleeing offshore . </s>
Then we went into Central America . You all remember that before we had the heroic wars of liberation in Afghanistan and Iraq we had the heroic war of liberation in Panama , where Manuel Noriega was indicted in a US court for drug dealing and we decided to send the US Army there , play very loud rock music , I am not kidding , and effectively arrested him . What has happened in almost all those cases is , the supply then shifts . And so it then shifted to Colombia , and we began Plan Colombia , which has been a vast , multi-year effort with many , many hundreds of American soldiers . </s>
When we talk about Mexico’s drug war which I will get to , one has to remember , that the wars on drugs that the United States has initiated over the last 40 years , have very much been ones involving troops and soldiers and bullets and deaths . Mexico is only the last in a long line of these drug wars . And so we got to Colombia , where the United States has now spent something in the range of eight to $ 10 billion . </s>
Colombia for many years was the second or third largest recipient of US aid , and much of that aid has gone toward intensely military activities . </s>
The GAO , the Government Accounting Office was asked to provide a summary report on what the effect of Plan Colombia has been . And this was only a few months ago , asked for by Vice President Biden , then- Senator Biden , had commissioned the report . </s>
And the results are plain . It has had virtually no effect . </s>
It seems as though heroin production is down , but cocaine production is up . </s>
And so you see the familiar Whack-a-Mole problem of the drug trade , which is that you push something down and something else pops up . And the two most common substitutions you see are the kind of drug , so you go from heroin to cocaine , and the place that these come from . You push it out of the Caribbean , you—it goes into Panama , you push it out of Panama it goes into Colombia , you push it out of Colombia , it goes to Mexico . And thus Mexico has to be seen as the last of a long line of these battles , in America’s war on drugs . And so in that sense you have to ask yourself , are we not in some way responsible for it ? </s>
Well here’s the simple reality . </s>
We are the largest consumer of drugs in the world . We have the most demand in the world . </s>
And we also have the largest supply of weaponry in the world . 2,000 guns cross the American border every day to go into Mexico . Hillary Clinton has pointed out that we are arming the Mexican gangsters who operate the drug trade . President Obama has pointed out that 90 percent of the weapons that are found in Mexico can be traced back to the United States . </s>
There has been some contestation over the statistics… Fox News says it’s only 17 percent , Factcheck.org says it’s probably higher than 36 percent , but maybe not quite as high as 90 percent . </s>
Let me give you a simple statistic . The United States has 280 million guns . 50 percent of all gun production every year is bought in the United States . There are 80 million registered gun users in the United States . There are 2,500 in Mexico . </s>
I think we may have something to do with this problem . So if you accept my proposition that the supply of weapons is coming from one place and the demand for drugs is coming from one place , it seems self-evident that we are responsible . You will hear many convincing arguments by honorable people on that side . Honorable opponents of the Mexican government like Mr. Castañeda who ran against President Calderón . </s>
Asa Hutchinson who ran the Drug Enforcement Agency . But remember one thing . </s>
The only question we are asking you is are we in some way responsible . Let us not one more time shirk our responsibility , and accept that the United States , as the leading consumer of drugs , and the leading supplier of weapons , has got to be partly or substantially to blame for this . Mexico is the latest battle— Fareed Zakaria— —in America’s drug war— </s>
—your time is up , thank you . Thank you . Our motion is “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” and speaking first against the motion , Asa Hutchinson who was a Congressman from Arkansas , an elected position , but he’s also held significant appointed positions , he was a US Attorney , he was in the Department of Homeland Security for controlling border security , and was also Director of the Drug Enforcement Agency which , Asa , makes it sound like , in terms of this narcotics issue , for a long time , you were the law . Indeed , and we enforced the law . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Asa Hutchinson . Thank you , and seriously , I did have occasion to head up the Drug Enforcement Administration , the DEA , and there’s one thing I learned , Fareed , very quickly as head of the DEA , that when you made a speech somewhere you had a way of drawing protesters . </s>
And particularly if you debated drug policy in San Francisco , so I am delighted that this audience is a little bit more friendly . </s>
And the other thing I learned that as a dad of a teenaged daughter , that being head of the DEA was a good way to drive away boyfriends that you didn’t want calling on your daughter . So , there are a few advantages to that . I am here today , on this debate topic because I believe it is critically important to the national security of the United States . I believe what happens in Mexico is critically important to that country , but I also believe that what happens in the overall fight against illegal drugs is important for this generation and the next of Americans . And I would agree with Fareed that we do have responsibilities , as United States citizens to reduce the demand for drugs in our country . </s>
There is a responsibility but ladies and gentlemen , I’ve noticed something thus far today , and they’re trying to change the proposition . The proposition is not that the United States shares some responsibility . The proposition is that America is to blame . And I believe there’s a distinction between blame and responsibility , or joint responsibility , or some responsibility . </s>
And “blame” is a heavy word , that implies that we as a government of the United States are doing something wrong . I agree that we have responsibility but it’s a shared responsibility . Drug consumption is not unique to the United States . I met with Vincente Fox in Mexico City . And I was there as Under-Secretary at Homeland Security but he didn’t want to talk about that subject with Secretary Ridge , he turned to me and said Asa , you were head of the DEA , we’ve got a problem in Mexico with drug consumption and addiction that we need to do something about . </s>
He was talking about Mexicans , and he’s talking about the challenges of drugs in his society . And that is across the globe that there is that problem . </s>
And…to respond to Fareed about where we are in our fight against drugs today , we should be reminded of some of our successes . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , since the late ‘70s and early ‘80s , when we initiated strong effort against the fight against drugs , we have reduced overall drug consumption in the United States by 50 percent . Please remember that statistic , you can go on monitoring the future websites , a consistent poll and survey that’s done , as well as SAMHSA’s survey…overall drug use has declined 50 percent in our country , cocaine use has declined 75 percent , since the height of the drug problems in the ‘70s , and in the ‘80s . Ladies and gentlemen , that is progress that represents saved lives . Now let me move quickly to why the Mexican drug war , the United States is not to blame for Mexico’s drug war . And the first answer is that Mexico has allowed itself to be a major transit and source country . </s>
They are a transit country obviously for drugs but the source drugs that come from Mexico , heroin , marijuana that they grow in the hills , as well as methamphetamine that they produce , they’re sources of that , and they as a sovereign country have allowed themselves to be in that predicament . Secondly , Mexico has resisted US help . This is important to put this in the context of history . </s>
In the 1980s , as Fareed pointed out , two thirds of our illegal drugs in the United States came through the Caribbean basin into Miami . We had Miami Vice , we slowed it down in the Caribbean basin , but they moved toward other avenues to bring it in , and that being Mexico and today 90 percent of the cocaine comes through Mexico . How did this happen . It’s because Mexico did not shoulder the burden to say we want to resist in our country , it is a long historic problem that goes back to the ‘80s , decades , it’s not something that’s just happened in the last three years . </s>
A key event happened . In February of 1985 , Kiki Camarena , a wonderful DEA agent , was captured in Guadalajara , brutally beaten , tortured , and murdered . It was a seminal event in our relations . As a result of that there was a massive manhunt for the perpetrators of that . Mexico believed that we were infringing upon their sovereignty . </s>
And therefore , they resisted any US assistance after that event in 1985 , in fact in 1986 the Foreign Minister of Mexico said , that “the activities of the DEA trample our sovereignty.” And ladies and gentlemen , I am here today respecting fully the government of Mexico for their sovereignty , but they have made their own decisions , as we have made our decisions and they are a responsible nation and they would not want to blame the United States of America , they are the ones that resisted our assistance during that time . President Calderón has most recently reinvigorated this fight against the drug-trafficking organizations in Mexico . But whose decision was it to move from , you’re infringing upon our sovereignty , in the ‘80s , and DEA get out , we don’t want to have anything to do with you , to the partnership that President Calderón wants to have . It was a sovereign decision by the leader of Mexico that said we’re going to go to war against the drug cartels . </s>
That decision should not be blamed on the United States of America , it was a Mexican decision . And then fourthly , it is very important to understand , that the culture of corruption that has developed in Mexico , the failure of the rule of law in Mexico , is one of the largest contributing factors to the violence that we see today . And , I was on the Crime Subcommittee . I asked a question of a cartel member who was brought there to testify . </s>
I said what is the greatest weapon that you fear in the United States arsenal , or in the law enforcement arsenal . The answer came back very quickly , we fear extradition . And why is that . </s>
They did not fear law enforcement in Mexico or in Central America . It was extradition to the United States of America , you can not have a failure of the rule of law , and be successful in the fight against drugs . The cartels have operated with impunity , and that is not the fault of the United States . The United States is not at fault for the historic problems in Mexico , we are not to blame for what has happened . </s>
Thank you , Asa Hutchinson . Speaking now for our motion , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” Jeffrey Miron who is a Harvard economist and whose views on narcotics in this country I think among this panel are probably unique . On most drugs he believes in decriminalization , and with decriminalization , no war . Ladies and gentlemen , Jeffrey Miron . Thank you very much , it’s very nice to be here , see so many people interested in this topic . </s>
Let me start by responding very briefly to a few of things that Mr. Hutchinson said . He said that in fact there’s evidence that the war on drugs has been effective in reducing drug use , as he mentioned that’s not really on point , that’s not really the question . But it’s also not correct . There’s tons of evidence , and I’m responsible for some of that evidence in my academic writing , on whether attempts to reduce consumption of drugs with prohibition are effective , and it universally finds little if any effect . Yes , you can cherry-pick certain statistics to find that in some periods drug use went down , okay , but in other periods it’s gone up , or some other kind of drug use went up , the overall result is clearly no evidence for the efficacy of prohibition . </s>
And note that over the last 40 years , we have dramatically ramped up our efforts to enforce prohibition , so we should have seen some effects if those effects were in any way going to be effective . Now turning to the proposition itself . Is America to blame for Mexico’s drug wars . The answer is indisputably yes . I want to argue it in three steps . </s>
First , there’s a fact already mentioned , that the US consumes a lot of drugs produced or trans-shipped through Mexico . No one disputes that and that’s clearly a part of the issue , but it’s not the whole issue , and it’s not the most important part of the issue , why , well…one , there’s not really anything we can do about the fact that the US consumers choose to consume drugs . Other countries consume some of the drugs from Mexico including Mexicans , including Canada or Europe , et cetera . But it is a piece of the story and it is one sense in which you might say that the proposition that America is to blame , is correct . </s>
But there’s a much , much more important sense . Why are there drug wars in Mexico . Why is there violence in the drug trade in the US , and many other countries . </s>
The reason there are drug wars is because the drug trade is prohibited . Whether you think drugs should be legal or not , it’s an indisputable fact , based on theory and evidence , that when you drive a market underground , it becomes violent . </s>
Why does it become violent ? Because participants in an underground market can not resolve their disputes with courts , with lawyers , by complaining to the Consumer Product Safety Commission or things like that . They can only resolve their disputes by shooting each other or by threatening to shoot each other . We see evidence of this from all over history and all over the world . </s>
The US alcohol industry was not violent before 1920 , when we passed alcohol prohibition . </s>
It was then dramatically violent for 14 years , until we repealed alcohol prohibition , and then the trade became perfectly nonviolent just like any other legal good . If we look at the history of prohibition of drugs , that trade was not violent until we prohibited drugs , and ramped up and escalated the war on drugs . </s>
If you look at other commodities from gambling to prostitution to blue jeans supplied in controlled economies where they were in short supply , to commodities driven underground by high tax rates , whenever you drive a market underground , that market becomes violent because participants resolve their disputes with violence , okay , completely independent of the characteristics of the good , whether you’re in favor or not of prohibiting that good , it’s just a fact of nature that the prohibition creates the violence . Now the second thing to recognize is that the US , far and away above any other country , has historically and repeatedly and persistently been the country that has foisted prohibition on the entire world . Starting in 1919 , in Paris , at the signing of the Treaty of Versailles which ended World War I , the US said it would not sign unless there was a clause in the treaty that required every other country to immediately go back and adopt drug prohibition . This is in 1919 . Throughout the history of the United Nations the US has made fighting drugs and prohibiting drugs in particular a key part of the UN’s mission . </s>
And very recently , the US has actively tried to push Canada , England , other countries , and in particular Mexico , to enforce drug prohibition and to adopt drug laws that we approve of . </s>
Let me read you some quotes that suggest someone else thinks this is right as well . </s>
“While every Mexican administration since the ‘60s has piously declared that it intended to intensify its drug enforcement efforts for domestic motivations , the fact is that the real reason has always been American pressure.” Okay ? Quote one . Quote two . </s>
“All this starts to show why current US drug policy would have to change in order for Mexico to change its stance . It also explains why it is virtually impossible for Mexico to follow a different policy unilaterally.” </s>
Okay ? So who wrote those words , suggesting that the US policy , the US insistence , the US pressure on Mexico , is the crucial factor , in determining Mexico’s drug policy . </s>
Well , it turns out it’s one of my opponents , Jorge Castañeda , in an article that I found on the Web a few days ago . So I don’t think that point , that the US has tried very , very hard , not always successfully , but has tried consistently , to make sure every country adopts drug prohibition -- that point is just not beyond rational dispute . So , part of the discussion here clearly is about what people think about legalization . I’ll comment on that in a second . But you actually don’t need to take a stand on whether it’s good to have drug legalization or drug prohibition , to take a view on the motion . </s>
You should be in favor of the motion because it’s just a matter of science and the evidence , that the US pressure to enforce prohibition in Mexico and the US prohibition in the US , are the reasons for the drug violence . </s>
Now some people may argue that violence is a cost of doing something that’s worthwhile . </s>
They may argue that prohibition reduces drug use , they may argue that drug prohibition has some other moral statement or something like that . </s>
Many other people including me would argue that prohibition mainly does bad things , not only the violence but the corruption , the restrictions on medicinal uses of drugs for people who are suffering , the infringements on civil liberties and on and on . Okay , and so you would think that for lots of reasons legalization is the right policy . But you don’t have to take a stand on that , regardless of your views on that , the correct position about the motion is that the US is indeed the single factor to blame for Mexico’s drug wars . Thank you very much . Thank you , Jeffrey Miron . </s>
A reminder of where we are , we are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared US debate , I’m John Donvan of ABC News . We have six debaters , two teams of three , and they’re debating this motion , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” You have heard three opening statements , and now on to the fourth , I’d like to introduce Chris Cox , the argument has already been made , that one of the reasons for Mexico’s drug war is the availability of an illicit supply of weapons from the United States . Chris Cox is going to debate that point , as chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association . </s>
Chris Cox . </s>
Thank you . Look , we can all agree that Mexico’s violent drug war is destroying innocent lives on both sides of the border . But some have suggested tonight that lax US gun laws or the lack of enough anti-gun laws are somehow to blame for this crisis . Yes ! </s>
I’m here to tell you—I’m here to tell you that it’s not just wrong , and it’s not just dishonest , it’s also a deliberate diversion away from the issues that really matter . So tonight let’s dispose of the lies and start telling the truth on this issue for a change . One that you just heard tonight was how 90 percent of the guns that are used by the drug cartels , come from the United States . </s>
Well , and not from CNN but after independent fact-checking organizations looked into it , it turned out the number wasn’t 90 percent . It wasn’t even close but Fareed , the question shouldn’t be how many guns , whether it’s 1 percent or 100 percent the question should be , well how can we reduce that number . That should be the question before us and the question is , well , maybe we can make smuggling guns into Mexico illegal , but the problem is we’ve already made it illegal . </s>
It’s illegal on both sides of the border , and you can’t really make something any more illegal than it already is . So let’s be absolutely clear . If you’re smuggling drugs , or running guns or doing anything illegal with a gun , whether it’s in Mexico City or New York City , you oughta be arrested , prosecuted , and thrown in jail . I think that’s something we can all agree with . </s>
No one more so than the National Rifle Association . Because these armed criminals don’t just endanger our families , they endanger our freedoms . </s>
And that’s why the NRA’s worked to pass meaningful laws , so if you misuse a gun in the commission of a crime , you’re going to go to jail . Let me mention just a few that we’ve worked on . </s>
If you give or even lend a gun to someone that you even think isn’t allowed to have one , you can go to jail for 10 years . If you’re arrested for dealing drugs and carrying a gun in this country , your sentence starts at five years , and that’s just for the gun . Pull the trigger , 10 years . </s>
If you shoot someone , you can go to jail for life or get the death penalty . And that’s not three strikes and you’re out , that’s one strike and you’re out . </s>
I challenge anyone to look at me with a straight face and say we could end the drug war in Mexico if we just pass one more gun law in the United States . It’s absurd , it won’t work , so let’s stop pretending that it will . Ask yourself . If American criminals don’t obey American gun laws , and Mexican criminals don’t obey Mexican gun laws , how is it that some new gun control law here in the United States is suddenly going to be obeyed by both . </s>
It’s not . Look , if you get caught trying to smuggle a gun into Mexico , you’re going to a US jail for a long time . And if you get caught on the Mexican side of the border , you could go to a Mexican jail for even longer . That is unless you can afford to make a donation to the Arresting Officer Scholarship Fund , which to these drug cartels , is nothing more than a small tax on doing business . </s>
So let’s not dance around the truth . The truth is they pump about $ 40 billion worth of product into our country . And it’s not just drugs . This is a sophisticated criminal enterprise , that seems to be involved in child prostitution , money- laundering , trafficking of pirated DVD’s , it’s a sophisticated enterprise . So it’s no wonder , they post profits of somewhere between 14 and $ 25 billion every year . </s>
That’s more profit than Microsoft makes . With that kind of money they’re buying whoever they want , whatever they want , wherever it is , no matter what it costs . </s>
Judging from the weapons that are seized , we know what they want . Fully automatic machine guns , RPG’s , hand grenades , armored personnel carriers , everything from airplanes to boats . Now intelligence sources say that this type of weaponry comes from the international black market . Places like China and Guatemala . But I got ta tell you the one place it doesn’t come from , are American gun shows or some mom-and-pop gun store in Texas or Arizona , ‘cause you can’t buy fully automatic weapons there , and you sure as hell can’t buy hand grenades , RPG’s and helicopter gunships . </s>
But there is another place that it’s available . The Mexican government . According to the New York Times , in the last seven years , more than 100,000 soldiers have deserted the Mexican army . </s>
Now how many people here think that all 100,000 turned their guns in before they betrayed their country . It’s ridiculous . </s>
Most of them were Special Forces , former Special Forces commandos or many of them went on to form their own drug cartel , the Zetas . </s>
Which our government says is the most sophisticated , technologically advanced , and dangerous cartel operating in Mexico . And the number-one organization responsible for most of the narcotic-related homicides , beheadings , kidnappings and extortions that take place in Mexico . </s>
But it’s not just the military . The cartels are working with the current administration as well . Last year more than a dozen ranking or former officials of the Calderón administration , were arrested for passing tips on to the drug traffickers . One of them , Mexico’s former drug czar . </s>
So if you want to talk seriously about this drug war , you’ve got ta talk seriously about the undeniable , institutionalized level of corruption , within the Mexican government . We need to stop talking around the issues , we’ve got enough laws . Everything the drug cartels are doing is already illegal , a hundred different ways on both sides of the border . We don’t need more laws , we’ve got all the tools we need . </s>
We’ve got the know-how , we’ve got the tools , the intelligence . </s>
What’s lacking is the guts , the political backbone to look each other in truth , and have an honest discussion about this issue . Instead of talking around the issues with some superficial discussion about how gun laws , which are going to continue to be ignored by criminals , could somehow make the difference . Nothing—and until we do that , nothing’s going to change and people on both sides of the border , will continue to pay the price with their lives . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Chris Cox . Our motion is “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” and to debate next for the motion , Andrés Martinez of the New America Foundation , ANDRÉS was born in Mexico but came to this country and went to a bunch of Ivy League schools and then he discovered Pittsburgh and the Post-Gazette and became a writer , an editorial writer , and since has written and been on the editorial boards of papers such as the Wall Street Journal , the Washington Post , the New York Times , and I give you , ladies and gentlemen , Andrés Martinez . ANDRÉS MARTINEZ Thank you . First off I want to make clear that I understand that some of Professor Castañeda’s students are in the auditorium . </s>
And I think it’s very important to reiterate and remind you that your vote is secret at the end of this , so— Your grades will not be affected by coming to the right side here . And I want to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation for holding this debate . As John mentioned , I grew up in Mexico in the 1970s , in the northern state of Chihuahua , and the capitol city of the same name . </s>
And back then it was a pretty easygoing mid-size city . My friends and I wouldn’t really think twice about hitchhiking home from school , or hopping on a city bus to go downtown to watch a movie , then grab a taco at our favorite hole-in-the-wall joint . Our parents didn’t really worry much about us then . I don’t mean to suggest that Chihuahua was Denmark . </s>
The state does sit on the border with the United States . And while the bulk of the hard drug trade in those days as Fareed mentioned , went through the Caribbean , there were plenty of trafficking organizations in the mountains of Chihuahua near the city . But we weren’t really aware of this , there was no violence , I didn’t even know anyone who did drugs . I got my first exposure to the consumer end of the pipeline when I came to school in the States . And it’s actually important to make clear that , contrary to something that was suggested earlier , consumption rates in Mexico still remain very low and that’s something we can explore later in the debate . </s>
The state of Chihuahua only became a bloody battleground , its border city of Ciudad Juarez synonymous practically with murder , after the US clamped down on the Caribbean routes via Miami once favored by the cartels . And that is what transformed Mexico into the global hub of the trade for drugs . I was talking to a childhood friend recently in Chihuahua and he told me that the city bears little resemblance to the place that we grew up in , and that he doesn’t dare now leave his kids out of sight . </s>
Lest they be kidnapped or caught in the crossfire between the cartels , or between the cartels and the security forces . </s>
I am proud I grew up in Mexico , and I’m even more proud to be an American . Which is why it’s doubly painful for me to acknowledge that America is responsible for what’s happened to Chihuahua , and that America is to blame for Mexico’s drug war . The United States can not continue to have it both ways . We Americans need to make a choice . Either we get serious about clamping down on the consumption of illegal drugs , or we should legalize them . </s>
Wherever you come down on the moral health , economic merits of criminalizing versus legalizing drugs , please acknowledge that a continuation of the hypocritical status quo , which criminalizes socially accepted behavior , undermines the rule of law , both in our country , and in countries overrun by the goons who arbitrage between our supposed morality , and our actual behavior . </s>
That may all sound a bit abstract . What’s a little erosion of the rule of law between friends . Until you start counting the corpses piling up south of the border . They are closing in on 15,000 just since President Calderón took office in late 2006 . </s>
And that’s nearly three times the number of US servicemen killed in Iraq and Afghanistan this decade . So let’s not be distracted by talk of corruption in Mexico or what percentage of guns in Mexico comes from where . Our debate isn’t about whether Mexico is like Denmark , or about America’s gun laws . It is about what happens to a nation that shares a 2,000-mile border with the richest nation on earth when that richest nation on earth insists on consuming some $ 65 billion worth of drugs a year , and insists on ceding control of that market , of that industry , to offshore criminal organizations . </s>
There’s an old saying in Mexico , perhaps you’ve heard it . “Poor Mexico , so far from God , so close to the United States.” </s>
But the real curse isn’t merely proximity to America . It’s being sandwiched between America’s insatiable demand for illicit drugs , and the sources of the most valuable of those drugs , the coca fields in Colombia and Bolivia . So let’s not be confused . Whatever Mexico’s shortcomings are , and there are plenty…and say Canada’s virtues , whatever those are— If our two neighboring countries…traded places , we’d be here talking about a Canadian war tonight . </s>
Geography sometimes is destiny . As Americans we believe in individual empowerment and the concept that our actions have consequences . As consumers we may shun products that harm the environment , maybe you buy fair-trade coffee . You know , we believe that our choices have consequences . </s>
On college campuses students have long thought globally but acted locally . You know , they mobilize against overseas sweatshops… Or they press institutions to to divest from investments that may harm people in Darfur or elsewhere . When I was in college in the States , the issue of the day was divestment from South Africa . Activists erected shantytowns on campus to pressure the college to stop investing in companies that were doing business there . Again , a laudable impulse . </s>
But even then I was struck by how some of these activists disregarded their socially responsible investment creed , when it came to recreational drugs . Their cash after all was underwriting the murder of elected officials , judges , and policemen in Colombia . As Fareed said back then that was the hub , and now it’s shifted to Mexico . And I do worry that we still haven’t made that connection . I actually shared this view with a girlfriend at the time in college , as an argument for our not indulging , and that may have hastened the demise of our relationship . </s>
She didn’t quite call me Buzzkill Martinez but maybe she did and I’ve omitted that memory . </s>
I must say though , President Obama to his credit has acknowledged this nexus . Saying that as the ultimate consumers of the drugs flowing north , we have a shared responsibility with Mexico in confronting its war . So we should count him as a member of our team here tonight . And even Ronald Reagan back in 1988 meeting with President de la Madrid said similar things , that the solution to the problem was for Americans to quit buying illegal drugs . And I would suggest another option , as has been suggested , is decriminalization . </s>
But we can’t continue to have it both ways . I recently read a best-selling book in Mexico by an author I respect a great deal , and from whom I’ve learned a lot . And on page 85 of that book , he wrote that the US wants Mexico… “to wage the war and provide the corpses , so it doesn’t have to.” And he refers to the US as exporting its internal conflict on drugs . </s>
The author of this book , and I’m sorry , Jorge , to pile on , but— You’re such prolific writer . The book is excellent . Is Jorge Castañeda of course , and , there’s still time , Jorge , for you to switch sides and come over to— to join us and Presidents Obama and Reagan . But I look forward to continuing this conversation , and thank you so much for your interest . Thank you , Andrés Martinez . </s>
Well , our next debater is Jorge Castañeda and as you’ve heard his words keep coming back to bite him tonight , that’s because he writes an awful lot , Jorge served as Mexico’s Foreign Minister in the early 2000’s , also your dad as well held that position back in the ‘70s , am I correct— JORGE CASTAÑEDA That’s right . He is also on the faculty here at New York University , ladies and gentlemen , Jorge Castañeda . JORGE CASTAÑEDA Very quickly first for my students , in Mexico we have ways of knowing how you vote . Be careful . </s>
Secondly , this is a tilted playing field . Because on that side , I have two of my current and former bosses and that’s not fair . Andrés Martinez is my boss at the New America Foundation , and Fareed had been my boss at Newsweek magazine for a long , long period of time . So obviously , you know , I feel somewhat constrained . </s>
My point is very simple here . The United States is not to blame for Mexico’s drug war , Mexico is not to blame for Mexico’s drug war , President Felipe Calderón is to blame for Mexico’s drug war , a war of choice that he should not have declared , that can not be won , and is doing enormous damage to Mexico . It was started on false premises , that Mexican consumption had grown by 2006 which is false according to the government’s own health statistics . </s>
Not only has Mexican consumption not grown , it is lower than the consumption not only of the United States and Western Europe , but of practically all of Latin America . It was premised on an increase in violence in Mexico through 2006 , which is also false . Willful homicides had been decreasing Mexico , for the previous 15 years , down to levels way below those of Central America , Brazil , Colombia , et cetera , though still higher than the United States . Thirdly , it was premised on a loss of state capacity to enforce the law in Mexico , from what you’ve heard here and quite rightly on both sides of the table , that state capacity in Mexico has never been immense , and it’s not necessarily worse today than it was before . </s>
Yes , there is corruption in Mexico , the point is there is more corruption today than there was 20 , 25 years ago . </s>
I say no there isn’t . And finally , this was also a war that was predicated on the issue , that there was a current explosion of war , which had to be stopped , it can not be stopped . Why did President Calderón declare this war of choice ? Because he felt that he needed to legitimize himself in the view of the Mexican people , because his election was questioned . </s>
Fareed , I’m sorry on this point , I tried to run against President— Candidate Calderón , and wasn’t allowed to , and supported him actively , and wrote in many of the places I wrote and that you all quote , that I actively supported , called on readers to vote for him , supported him actively , during the campaign , during the election , and during the post-election discussion on whether the election was free and fair , which I thought it was . I thought he won , most Mexicans thought he won , but he decided that he had to legitimize himself in the eyes of the Mexican people for a questioned election . And he thought that this was the way to do it , by calling the Army out into the streets , donning a military uniform for the first time in 50 years of Mexican history , and trying to achieve , through the war on drugs , what he could have achieved in a much more useful way . This war can not be won , simply because it is failing to comply with the fundamental tenets of a very good friend of mine , that some of you may know , Colin Powell’s view of the first Gulf War . To go into war like this , you need to have overwhelming force , we don’t have it . </s>
You need to have a definition of victory , we don’t have it . You need to have an exit strategy , we don’t have it . </s>
And you should have the support of the Mexican people in this case , which President Calderón does have , but he’s running out of it very quickly . Is the US to blame for this ? </s>
I tend to think it’s not directly to blame , although there is a case to be made for the consumption and arms argument . The problem with the consumption argument , is that if the United States is going to reduce consumption significantly , well , it’s time to do so . </s>
And frankly that doesn’t seem to be what American society wants to do . I don’t see the United States wanting to reduce American consumption or demand . Frankly , if I was an American citizen and was asked to vote on this question , I would vote against reducing US consumption . Why bother ? There’re much more intelligent things to do with US consumption , I believe , than trying to reduce it . </s>
For example , legalize or decriminalize the consumption of as many drugs as is reasonable right now . Start with what you can , see what happens , and then move forward . Is there an alternative issue—approach , of course there is . We don’t have to proceed the way President Calderón has , we don’t have to proceed the way both the Bush and Obama administration , who on this point , are exactly identical in their policy toward Mexico… We don’t have to proceed the way Calderón has proceeded and the way Bush and Obama have supported him . We don’t have to declare a war on all the cartels all the time as Carlos Fuentes has said . </s>
We can do either what the Colombians did , combat collateral damages . We can pursue a policy of harm reduction in Mexico . And we can pursue a policy in the United States , Mexicans , we Mexicans , of trying to lobby in the United States in favor of decriminalization where it can be done . But we certainly don’t have to go to war with more than 15,000 people already killed in drug-related killings , and the number rising every week , every month , every year . </s>
We have far more executions today in Mexico , than we had four years ago . But the last point I want to make is the most absurd one . </s>
We have tens of people dying every day in Tijuana . On the border , with the United States . Sometimes , 50 , 60 , 70 . And , they are there basically dying to stop Mexican marijuana , among other drugs , from entering the United States . </s>
The small problem is that 120 miles north of Tijuana , in Los Angeles , there are more public , legal dispensaries of medical marijuana than public schools . There are more than a thousand medical dispensaries of marijuana in Los Angeles , perfectly legal . So we have our guys dying south of the border , to stop the marijuana from entering the United States , and being sold legally in Los Angeles . </s>
I think there’s something fundamentally wrong with that idea , it doesn’t work , it’s a war that can not be won , it’s a war that should not have been waged , and it’s a war that we should call off promptly . The United States is not to blame for it , Mexico is not to blame for it , it’s a war of choice that President Calderón declared for strictly political reasons , thank you . Thank you , Jorge Castañeda . And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared debate . </s>
Our motion is , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” and we now have the results of where you our live audience stood before this debate began . You are the judges in this debate , you’re voting both before and again at the end , and the team that changes the most of your minds will be declared our winner . Here are the results where things started at the beginning . Our motion is “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” at the start , 43 percent of you were for…22 percent against , and 35 percent undecided . So we’ll have you vote once again at the end of the debate , and the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner . </s>
On now to Round 2 of this Intelligence Squared US debate , it’s our middle round , in which the debaters talk directly to one another , can challenge one another , and also we’ll take questions from myself and from you in the audience , and I’d like to start by asking you , Fareed , the point that Jorge Castañeda just made that , Mexico’s drug war basically is the fault of one man…do you buy it ? I’m a little confused listening to that whole team because , Asa Hutchinson says , consumption is down . Jorge Castañeda says consumption is up . </s>
I mean I’ve welcomed diversity but this is ridiculous . And more fundamentally it seems as though there is a contradiction here which is…Asa Hutchinson says , the problem , the reason Mexico has become this hellhole is because it did not declare war on drugs and did not prosecute efficiently and did not take the fight to the enemy . So then they do that , and Jorge Castañeda says , that’s the problem . I think it just proves that this is all kabuki . What we are talking about fundamentally is , these countries , among the poorer countries in the world , they are trying to fulfill insatiable demand for $ 65 billion of product . </s>
If it goes away from Mexico we will be back here next year , and we will be talking about , you know , the drug war in Peru , or somewhere else , because , the supply—Asa Hutchinson , as a Republican you surely believe , that , if there is a huge amount of demand from the richest country in the world , somebody is going to figure out a way to supply it . All right , team—team— That somebody is Mexico right now and we’re blaming them . </s>
Team against , Fareed Zakaria has just said you’re contradicting each other . Asa Hutchinson , can you find unity . Well , I think first of all , among the six of us up here there’s probably a different position on this issue for each one of us . </s>
But what this side is united upon is the proposition , and we have to come back to the proposition , that America is to blame for Mexico’s drug war . And there is unity on this side that that is not the case . Whether you take the argument that it is the decision of President Calderón , or whether it’s the fact of the historic problems in Mexico , their lack of cooperation or lack of the rule of law , America is not to blame . </s>
Now let me see if there’s unity on your side , Fareed . I just want to make it clear that if you’re saying America’s to blame to me that implies that there’s something wrong with our governmental policy . Now you can argue that as individual citizens , we should be making better decisions not to use drugs . But as you have libertarians on your side , that’s an individual citizen , not a governmental decision . </s>
So I assume that you’re saying our government is doing something wrong . We’ve had a balanced approach , strategy , of supply reduction , demand reduction , trying to teach young people to make good decisions , and rehabilitation . </s>
Do you want to move away from that to legalize marijuana , to legalize cocaine , to legalize heroin , to legalize methamphetamine , to legalize Ecstasy that comes from other countries . What is the position of your team , do you want to legalize all drugs , is that the shift in policy that you— </s>
Jeffrey— —wish to take . </s>
Jeffrey Miron . I don’t want to speak for others on that question— </s>
I want an answer from Fareed first too , though . No , let me , I want to go to the libertarian . </s>
My— My position , separate from—independent of this debate is that we should legalize all drugs . I think the unity amongst the three of us although we probably differ in nuances of that view , is that , unquestionably the magnitude of resources we devote to prohibition is grotesquely excessive , that the set of things that we prohibit is substantially excessive , that there may be a role for government to try to address the negatives associated with drug use , through treatment , through harm reduction , through various policies , but that the current practice of spending tens of billions , by my estimates about $ 80 billion a year , locking people up , to try to get rid of the drug trade , is an incredibly counterproductive policy and we should stop . Chris Cox , what’s wrong with that argument ? Well , I’d like to point out what may be another contradiction , Fareed seems to think that gun control is— </s>
No , no , I want you to answer the question , what’s wrong with that argument . I’ll defer to Asa Hutchinson on the— </s>
Okay— —the drug— Fair enough— —on the drug question . </s>
Well , should I answer Asa’s… Because he’s charging me with— </s>
Please— ANDRÉS MARTINEZ Can I butt in on that too— I mean , you— Take it , Fareed— —you might be surprised but Asa , I would join with the former presidents of Brazil and Mexico and Colombia , who recently put out a report in which they said , we just need a paradigm shift here because what we have done is criminalize and terrorize this entire process , by waging war on drugs , and what we need to start doing , is a comprehensive review of whether there are ways to decriminalize it . Look , many people have decriminalized drugs , I would be in favor of a controlled , slow , incremental approach , to see what happens . </s>
But I think there’s no question , that our current approach , massive criminalization , massive prohibitions , and most importantly the exporting of that war to other countries , is producing all the violence , it’s producing the criminality as Jeff pointed out . The reason this whole business is violent and criminal is because we have prosecuted it as a war . That is to me the fundamental responsibility we have , which we can not shirk from . There are people dying in Mexico because of those choices that we have made . Chris Cox , your expertise is the weapons issue , and the others—you made an argument that , laws restricting weapons won’t work , the other side is making more a simple argument , the very presence of American , of weapons sourced in the United States , are responsible for the war to some degree . </s>
Can you take on that question , the weapons are there—are those weapons part of the reason that—and they’re in the hands of the cartels—are those weapons part of the reason , that the war is going on and being prosecuted . Well there’s no question when drug cartels are armed with hand grenades , when they’re armed with RPG’s , fully automatic weapons , that there’s a devastating effect on not only the drug cartels themselves fighting with one another but the innocent people in Mexico , who have no ability to defend themselves whatsoever . But the question becomes more of a common-sense type question . Is there something that the US can do , from a more gun control standpoint , that’s going to work any better than what works now , there’s a total ban— </s>
Okay— —on guns , basically— </s>
Fair question— —in Mexico now— —let me take it to the other side— </s>
It’s not working in Mexico . ANDRÉS MARTINEZ All right— </s>
Andrés Martinez . ANDRÉS MARTINEZ Yeah , first off , I think Asa is twisting the proposition a bit by bringing it back constantly to the American government . </s>
“America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” the “America” there is , is a larger entity , it’s all of society . There are government policies but there’s also individual behavior and societal norms , and the disconnect between our laws and our behavior . </s>
And as a good Republican I would think that you wouldn’t necessarily always equate America with the American government . I think the dynamic— The dynamic here is there’s a pattern of behavior in terms of that this bilateral relationship . Where the United States historically has seen Mexico as a kind of back-yard Las Vegas where , the usual rules don’t apply , what happens in Mexico can stay in Mexico . So we can export our , our unresolved contradictions down there . People in Mexico are bearing the burdens of our conflict on drugs , and the fact that we have dysfunctional laws , it’s Mexicans doing the dying for our unresolved— We can’t bear as a society to go without these drugs , but we also can’t bring ourselves to legalize them . </s>
And— Andrés , Andrés , I— ANDRÉS MARTINEZ —what’s the cost of this— —you’re not actually answering Chris’s question , Chris , restate your question— ANDRÉS MARTINEZ I don’t— —in one sentence— ANDRÉS MARTINEZ I didn’t have an opportunity to talk about the— Okay , my question was , there’s basically a total gun ban in Mexico now . </s>
How effective is that working and do you think that we should bring that sort of gun ban to America , when if you look at cities like Juarez , Mexico , which are just devastated with cri—with drug cartel violence , and El Paso which is just a stone’s throw across the Rio Grande , that’s the third safest city in America , how do you rectify— ANDRÉS MARTINEZ Well you’re also trying to twist the proposition into making it “America’s Gun Laws are to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” </s>
I think there’s a broader issue here , I mean I would follow the money , not necessarily the guns . There are an awful lot of American guns making their way to Mexico . However , it is true , that if you’re making $ 20-30 billion in the United States because American society has decided that this one industry that it doesn’t want to go away is going to be ceded to criminal organizations , you would be able to buy those guns elsewhere , I will grant you that . </s>
If the United States had the toughest gun control laws in the entire world…the Mexican drug cartels would still be armed to the teeth . What they’re really getting out of the United States , first and foremost , is guns , the fact that it’s very convenient for them to pick up guns while they’re here tallying up their profits , that just adds insult to injury . Jorge Castañeda . JORGE CASTAÑEDA I would sort of go back to another question , my impression is that , at least on that side , you all seem to agree that this is a failed war . </s>
Which is certainly what I think , it’s the title of my book . I quote at length , Zedillo , Cardoso and Gaviria document at the end , who also said it’s a failed war . And I think that this is—failed wars should not be waged . </s>
If you continue , if you persevere in a failed war , you will continue to fail . </s>
So I think the key issue there is , what should Mexico and the United States , and basically the two governments because there , Andrés , it’s difficult to decide on the part of American society or Mexican society , that’s why you vote , that’s why we vote now . We didn’t always— We always voted but sometimes we voted for people or sometimes people voted for us but anyway . </s>
Or the government did . But , the fact is that now the question is what should the governments do . And the problem is that the Obama administration and the Calderón administration are in total synch in continuing this failed war . Pouring money into it , having more people die in Mexico because of it , while at the same time—and I agree with the Obama administration— at the same time , President Obama and Attorney General Holder say they are not going to apply federal anti-marijuana laws in those states that have legalized medical marijuana . Which I think is wonderful by the way . </s>
What I don’t understand is why President Obama and Attorney General Holder on the one hand do that , and on the other hand , give money to Calderón to wage a failed war on drugs . I think that’s the real question , not so much if I may be allowed to say so , who is to blame for Mexico’s drug war , which perhaps was not the right way to phrase the debate . I’ll come back to you , Asa , Jeffrey Miron . I will come back to you . Just want to say I agree with that— </s>
Okay , let— Are— you wanted to say very briefly ? Oh no , I just for once I do agree with my debate partner— I think he sorta nailed it— It’s so nice when it works out that way . </s>
You just heard— Jeffrey Miron— Just heard Mr. Hutchinson say it that they’ve only agreed with each other once so far this evening . To go back to the gun point . What Christopher Cox is arguing is that if you take a substance , a commodity , that a large number of people want to own , and you prohibit it , a whole bunch of consequences happen . </s>
The market goes underground , it may shrink a bit , you may make it more costly , but it’s not going to disappear . It’s going to go underground . Then there will be corruption , as people try to evade those laws , there will be violence as people in the underground market resolve their disputes . There will be poor quality control and so on and so forth . Mr. Cox makes that argument , with respect to guns . </s>
Okay , he’s opposed to strenuous gun laws to prohibiting guns , but exactly the same arguments , apply to prohibiting drugs . The structure of the argument , the logic of the argument , is totally compelling , and it’s right for both commodities , not just one , and not just the others , so libertarians think that guns should be legal , and drugs should be legal . I hope that my opponent agrees with that proposition . </s>
CHRIS COX Actually , I agree— I agree with quite a bit of Jeff’s arguments , certainly— Chris Cox— —not with regards to guns but I certainly agree with your study— Oh , they’re dropping like flies on that side— Actually—there is a contradiction , believe it or not there is a contradiction on the other side . </s>
Fareed has pointed out some false statistics to suggest that more gun control laws would somehow have a major impact in this drug war . Ice agents have said we already have— Fareed , did you make that— </s>
I don’t think he said— Did you make the point about gun control— No , my point was the one you raised , the general prevalence of 280 million guns here , which is about a third of all guns worldwide , the fact that we share a border with one of the poorer countries in the world , and there is vast drug trade and vast cartels means…this is an easy way to criminalize and to accelerate the violence of this trade . All right , I interrupted you because I didn’t hear Fareed make that argument , so— Okay , what I heard Fareed say was parrot many of the arguments that have been made by the gun control community but perhaps that’s not a fair reflection on Fareed’s own personal views but the contradiction is that , to suggest that we have a lot of guns , therefore , we’re part of the problem is to suggest that more gun control would make us less of a problem , and I think what Jeff has argued , certainly in his past writings is that , homicide rates amongst countries with the highest gun control , tend to be higher than homicide rates with those countries with the lowest gun control . </s>
So that’s certainly an area where I agree with Jeff but I would not agree with Jeff that , crystal meth , crystal meth addicts all over this country that are devastating communities all over this country are somehow a fair comparison to law-abiding gun owners in this country . Can I—could I respond to that , I mean— Yes , please do . Throughout the last— </s>
We talked about— —90 years— —legalizing drugs— </s>
—the drug prohibitionists have identified one— —we’re talking about legalizing crystal meth ? </s>
Sorry ? We’re talking about legalizing crystal meth now— </s>
Yes . Yes , because if you go back and read what people were writing in the 1950s— </s>
Jeffrey Miron— —about marijuana . </s>
They were saying things absolutely as strong , absolutely worse than what people are claiming now about crystal meth , if you look at the data on the— Whoa-hoahhh— —number of people who use crystal meth , there’s zillions of people using it every day and a teeny fraction of them are doing the kinds of things that you’re describing . The drug prohibitionists for 90 years have constantly had a moving target , as soon as they identify one drug and say this is the killer drug , this is the one that’s the most evil , this is the one that’s going to destroy society . </s>
But , relevant to— And there’s some violence— —relevant to our motion— —associated with trying to prohibit that— </s>
—relevant to our motion , Jeffrey’s point is that if you decriminalize , the need for war would go away because the bad guys wouldn’t have to defend and fight out on the streets , they could do it in courtrooms . But , and— Do— what do you think of that . </s>
Again , I think the point’s almost irrelevant . The point is , whether or not the weapons that we’re suggesting , and Jeff has written as well that… violence— Weapons don’t create violence , violence creates a need for weapons and that these weapons are coming as even Andrés has pointed out from other areas , not only Central America but Russian , the former Soviet blocs that dumped guns in Mexico during the Cold War by the millions , if certainly by the tens of thousands . These weapons are there , and so , it’s really—I tend to agree with Jorge , we’re missing the point here— </s>
Right . Is America to blame , of course we’re not— Well let me ask Asa , the whole decriminalization question seems to get your hackles up . Well— I think— </s>
His point is not whether it’s good or bad for the users , his point is whether it would make the war go away . </s>
And I’m going to get to that , but I would think— I would think , I was hoping that we would have agreement that cocaine , methamphetamine , heroin are harmful drugs and our goal in society would be to reduce the usage of those drugs . Well do you think— After hearing Jeffrey say— —alcohol and tobacco are harmful drugs— After Jeffrey argues that methamphetamine is not as harmful as everybody says , and that would include the decriminalization , we can’t even reach an agreement on that point . </s>
But if you want to reduce usage , for example Alaska in the ‘70s voted to decriminalize marijuana . And once they did that guess what happened . </s>
The usage went up , parents did not like what they saw , and so the Alaskan voters voted to recriminalize that offense . Because usage went up , and that should not be the goal of parents , that’s the concern of parents . In terms of the drug trafficking and the war , I would make the argument it might have some peripheral impact , it depends on the extent that you legalize , if you just legalize marijuana , they’re not going to go away . </s>
Guess what , they’ve got cocaine , they’ve got heroin , et cetera , to market . </s>
If you legalize all of them , guess what . You still have prescription drugs there would be a black market on , that are totally regulated . They’re moving into other areas from alien trafficking , they’re business people . </s>
And the only solution to the war on drugs , is the rule of law . And Mexico does not have that right now . I want them to have that , Calderón seems to want them to have it . </s>
The fight is on the rule of law and unless you establish that , decriminalization is not going to rid Mexico of the drug war . Andrés , just one second , I’m going to come right to you , I want to go after Andrés speaks to questions from the audience , I want to remind you once again , raise your hand , I’ll find you , a microphone will be handed over to you , stand up , if you’re a member of the news media please identify yourself , and please make it a question . Andrés . ANDRÉS MARTINEZ I totally agree that the issue is the rule of law but it’s the rule of law in this country , it’s our failure to uphold the rule of law that is to blame for Mexico’s drug war . We are the ones with an addiction rate of illicit drugs that’s six times higher than in Mexico . </s>
We are the ones who are abusing this stuff , but can’t bring ourselves to legalize it , and it’s people in Mexico who are dying for that . We as a society , and I don’t think -- you can be agnostic about whether or not drugs should be legalized , if that were the subject , the proposition tonight , I’m not sure which side I would be on . You can be agnostic on that , and still recognize the , the basic fact that the United States is to blame for the war on drugs . And I’m glad you mentioned immigration because you say , well , they’re diversifying into human trafficking . </s>
Well geez , I wonder why , again . Our failure to enact an immigration reform that matches supply and demand , again , we—again , back to my point about— You’re blaming the United States for a lot of ills , in the world— ANDRÉS MARTINEZ Well…let’s think about this , we are as addicted to Mexican low-cost labor as we are to imported drugs— </s>
And Mexico has no— ANDRÉS MARTINEZ —but we fail—but we— —responsibility whatsoever— ? </s>
ANDRÉS MARTINEZ But we can not — But we can not bring ourselves to create legal channels for that . So either we have to decide , let’s close down the border , not import low-cost labor , and it’s the similar—it’s a parallel debate to what’s happening on the drug front . </s>
Let’s— ANDRÉS MARTINEZ Your point about marijuana , 60 percent of the cartels’ profits come from marijuana— Audience questions now . If you just bring your hand up… There’s a gentleman , with a blue shirt , necktie , no jacket . Thank you . </s>
Hello , this is a question for Mr. Hutchinson . </s>
And I want to remind everybody how Mr. Hutchinson started talking . Mr. Hutchinson started talking that as a representative of the US government , he was in Mexico , and he was trying to pressure the government of Mr. Fox , to bring troops to go after , or people , to go after the people that had killed Mr. Camarena . </s>
And had tortured Mr. Camarena . I have these two—there are two questions that arise from . </s>
Both of them— Just , just—I , I’ll just take one . Okay . </s>
The , the question that arises from that , doesn’t he feel , as a representative of the American government , that he has a special duty to respect the sensitivity of the Mexican people about bringing American armed forces into Mexico . Because there is a special event in the Amer—Mexican— </s>
Okay , I—sir , I’ll stop you there because , you did ask a question— No , but this is very important that he forgets— Sir , I’m sorry , I need you to— —the United States took away— </s>
—get to your point and we do understand— —50 percent of Mexican— Asa , why don’t you take it and then Jorge wants to try— </s>
Yeah , I think that it— JOHN DONVAN Thank you , sir . Thank you , sir , it is actually a very good point that , if the United States did not regard Mexican sovereignty , and we wanted to solve the transit and source country problems we would send our troops there . </s>
But they’re a sovereign nation and we can not go in there without an act of— declaration of war or some good cause which doesn’t exist , we’re not doing that , we’re regarding their sovereignty . But whenever we have a high regard for their sovereignty , that means America is not to blame . And yes , it wasn’t President Fox that I—I did go to see him but , Camarena was killed under a previous administration , I was not administrator then . But I know that history very well because it lives in the hearts of every DEA agent . And the fact is that he was murdered brutally , but more importantly , we wanted to assist Mexico and we were not allowed to do so because of the sovereignty of that country . </s>
Responsibility is something that’s shared , blame is something that is uniquely America’s fault , and that is not the case here . Fareed Zakaria . Can I just point out that we are respecting Mexico’s sovereignty , we are not respecting so much Afghanistan’s sovereignty , we have a hundred thousand troops in there , NATO and the US , we will have 130,000 troops in there . </s>
And yet , we have not been able to do anything about the opium trade . I doubt very much if we send American troops into Mexico it would change the fundamental fact , where there is demand there will be supply— Guess what , we’re not doing that , that’s not the suggestion— </s>
Jorge Castañeda— —it’s not on the table— JORGE CASTAÑEDA Just as a point of factual issues here . To the best of my knowledge , and although I was not present at all of the meetings but between my father , my brother and myself we have been present at most of the summit meetings between American and Mexican presidents over the last 30 years , I do not recall ever the United States having asked for US troops to go to Mexico , firstly . And secondly , strangely enough , though obviously I stand by what you both quoted , in the case of President Calderón , in December of 2006 , my impression , I don’t know this as a fact . My impression is actually , that the Bush people did not pressure him into declaring this war . </s>
This was a decision he made absolutely on his own . </s>
Unlike what had happened on other occasions under Echeverría , López Portillo , mainly de la Madrid , and then again on—under Salinas , my impression back then , the US did pressure these Mexican presidents to engage in more active drug enforcement , but the Bush people , not because they believed in not holding , pursuing this war , but perhaps because they had other wars to pursue , which were concentrating their attention at the time— Okay , halfway up the aisle there— JORGE CASTAÑEDA —did not pressure Mexico . Hi , I’m Robert Aleto , I’m a student . My question concerns the Mexican national economy and what role you think that plays in this issue . </s>
Because , there’s been a lot of demographic — And will you be able to relate this to our question about whether America is to blame . Well— I think you probably can but— Transformation of the Mexican economy over the last several decades , I mean , America has a lot to do with that . </s>
And so I’m wondering if that transformation plays a role , in this drug violence , ‘cause a lotta these other factors , doing drugs , the transfer of guns , they seem fairly static , whereas , you know , the violence in Mexico has increased tremendously over the last few years , what is not static , what is changing— </s>
Okay . Andrés Martinez . ANDRÉS MARTINEZ Well , I think it’s true that Mexico has , really undergone a tremendous transformation , it’s a poor country compared to the US but it’s actually , if you look at it in global terms , it’s a fairly successful , relatively successful middle-income country plodding along , it’s just a stark contrast that it shares a border with the US . </s>
I think that the United States has opened up Mexico’s economy through NAFTA and through other ways so , it probably has given—the Mexican cartels have been able to take advantage of that—I don’t—I think it’s a little bit of a side issue to our main discussion here . But if you think about Mexico becoming a logistical hub for this global enterprise , a lot of what’s changed in Mexico has probably accelerated that and aided it . </s>
But— Does this mean NAFTA is to blame for Mexico’s drug war— ANDRÉS MARTINEZ But it’s— You know , I think just because it’s a lot easier for a lotta people in Mexico now to do business , likewise for the drug cartels , but I think this is a bit of a side issue . Okay . </s>
There’s a gentleman , with the eyeglasses , and your hand is up , doing one of these . And the mic’s coming down to you . And again I urge you to be… question terse— Hi , my name’s Tony Amato , I’m a Penn State student . </s>
My question is to the panel that is motioning against . What I want to know is… the amount of money that’s made in the drug trade , is astronomical . </s>
If you were to legalize or decriminalize or end prohibition on drugs , how would these drug cartels pay for this organization . </s>
I mean you did comment and say they , they could traffic people , they could traffic illegal goods , but the bulk of the money , comes from illegal drugs , so if you take the revenue stream out , how could they finance the , the organization , that’s what I’d like to know . </s>
Okay , so Jorge Castañeda , why don’t you take that— JORGE CASTAÑEDA Well— —and Asa , do you want to also— JORGE CASTAÑEDA I think it would be very difficult for them to finance which is why I also favor growing decriminalization or depenalization , I think that it would help , it’s easy or relatively easy I think with the marijuana and heroin issues , cocaine and methamphetamine issues are complicated , they’re more complicated . </s>
But you can start with something and see where it goes . The main point is I think you’re absolutely right , a lot of the profits would diminish . They’d go into the other businesses , yes , that’s absolutely true what Asa what saying . But the core business remains drugs . Let’s not get that part wrong , that’s the core business , and if you legalize that then , yes , you will probably have them making less money . </s>
The other side care to respond , if not I’ll move on . Okay . The experience of US alcohol prohibition , was that the vast majority— Jeffrey Miron— </s>
—of the illegal alcohol producers , became legal alcohol producers , and there was not a big surge in violence as they went into some other industry because initially there were not other industries that were highly prohibited for which they could make a lot of profit , they had to make an honest living in legal industries and the rates of returns were modest . </s>
La Cosa Nostra , organized crime , came into existence and benefited tremendously after Prohibition , they had plenty of work to do , organized crime in the United States , even after Prohibition . From trafficking in drugs , which were illegal . Well , they , in a whole— They— and a whole host— Gentleman in the red tie ? </s>
And if you can stand the mic will be handed over to you . </s>
The term “black market” invariably means , free markets that have been driven underground as Mr. Miron has eloquently demonstrated , particularly with the example of Prohibition . That happens because of bad laws or I would say , immoral laws . </s>
Mr. Miron , can you relate , the discussion has been more on practical matters , this works , that doesn’t work . But this is a moral issue and it’s an issue of individual rights , can you relate…the drug laws to individual rights and perhaps being a libertarian you might be able to relate it to the objectivist position . Um… I’m actually more of a consequential libertarian than a rights-based libertarian , but we shouldn’t probably get into that— Well , we’re getting some real inside libertarian baseball here . Yeah . </s>
But I think that your question can be phrased in one of two ways , one way some people think about this issue of drug use is to say , individuals have rights to consume what they want , to do what they want as long as they’re not harming innocent third parties . A different way that people would say it is that , we should prohibit actions which negatively impact third parties without really using the word “rights.” We should let them consume what they want because it makes them happy , we don’t necessarily have to use those words , but they lead you to exactly the same positions . Both the moral perspective and the sort of mundane , practical perspective . </s>
We think about what the policies are , the policies have different consequences , and you can include morality as one of those sets of consequences . But the libertarian position is we should look at all the sets of consequences , not just the feel-good consequences—not just the alleged consequences , say eliminating drug use , which in fact doesn’t happen—when we decide whether to criminalize drugs . </s>
I just , yes , right here . Thank you , sir . I wonder if you look back on the history of drug abuse in this country , it feels not only an underground element , but it fuels other addictions—sexual addictions , it fuels the necessity , the necessity to try and buy drugs—regardless of what they cost . Because the ultimate problem with drugs is that they cost money . </s>
And if you know , if we legalize ‘em , they are going to be more expensive than they are now , because the government will get involved in trying to… Of course , we put a… Sir , sir , how… ? Could… ? Yeah . </s>
With respect to your question… Well , what I want to say is… …how would you relate it to our , to our discussion ? </s>
Well , what… The question is… Legalization of drugs is not going to change anything , and it’s not the reason for America’s blame on the Mexican drug problem , or the Mexican drug war . Now what I want to understand from you people is….how do you feel that the legalization is going to make , all of a sudden , everything great ? And no one is going to do drugs , and no one is going to create crimes , and nothing is going to happen that’s going to become more problems… </s>
But you , I don’t think that’s what your point is here… Well , you… Well , let’s take a hack at it . You have a controlled experiment . </s>
It is very rare in history to have a very simple , controlled experiment—which was the prohibition of alcohol . And all these arguments were made—and that’s alcohol consumption did decline somewhat during Prohibition , but it produced a vast criminal enterprise . </s>
It produced associated crimes in exactly the way you are describing . And then , once it was decriminalized , most of it—the vast majority of it—went away . So you know , nothing… No analogy is perfect , but it’s very rare in history that you have actually , a case that’s about as close as you can get… It’s very important also to point out , I think , for people thinking about this . There are many different ways you can decriminalize . You can decriminalize with , you know , medical use . </s>
You can decriminalize with a very strong public health campaign , the way we have done with tobacco . </s>
It can be even stronger in terms of the regulatory issues involved . So it… That you can decriminalize some and not others . I do not agree that it is impossible to draw some lines . </s>
Well , we draw lines all the time . </s>
Alcohol is , at some level , a drug , and we have decriminalized it . </s>
So it is possible to do this in many different ways . We do have one historical example that’s pretty powerful . OK . Just a little bit of radio business . </s>
We are in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I am John Donvan . As moderator , we have six debaters—two teams of three— debating this motion : “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” I’d like to know , is there a question on the weapons issue , because we have Chris Cox here , and that is , that is his purview and that… Do I see a hand going up ? Yeah , yes , down in the…the third row . I’ll bring a mike over to you . </s>
My name is Alan Borstein , and I have a pistol license for three pistols and five shotguns in my apartment on Park Avenue . Stand clear . Yeah . Go ahead . Well , birds , which I eat . </s>
And , um… I think the gun issue is a totally separate issue and maybe something for debate at some point as to how they should be controlled . As far as the drug issue is concerned , I think that taxing it would be a great help . And , I wonder if you think there are other ways to reduce consumption in the United States , besides the drug war and what… </s>
All right , fair question . Since… And why don’t you take that , uh , Jeffrey ? There are certainly possibilities for reducing use of any substance that we legalize , relative to what you would get otherwise . </s>
Minimum purchase ages might have some effect , although the evidence suggests they have relatively minor effects . A tax is almost certainly the most effective way , because that unambiguously raises the price . But there are clearly limits to what you can do with the tax , because if you make the tax high , try to make the price really high , you drive the market back underground . </s>
So the accurate view is—you can adjust how much people consume somewhat , but you can’t fundamentally change the fact that people are going to use these substances . And whether you are getting the people you would like to discourage to stop using is much , much less clear . </s>
In particular , by making it illegal , people who have no respect for the law are likely the ones who go ahead and consume it anyway . The people who are likely the responsible users—the ones who might do it in moderation were it legal—are the ones who are deterred , so that’s exactly backwards under a policy of Prohibition . </s>
There is a gentleman with a…waving a green card ? The mike is coming to you . </s>
Thank you , good evening . I have been an avid reader of Jorge Castañeda for years and years . </s>
And aside of his very well recommended agenda against President Calderón , he tried to change the terms of the debate tonight and put the blame on President Calderón . </s>
To me , it is crazy for President Calderón to wage a war the way he is doing . </s>
He is very courageous and I applaud him . And today , Jorge failed to present a side—just throwing punches against the President of Mexico—for him to present an alternative . He failed tonight . </s>
He failed in his recent book . </s>
I would like to hear something , a real proposal like this—without the comprehensive , comprehensive strategy against President Calderón . Thank you . Well , do you really want to take that , ‘cause I am… JORGE CASTAÑEDA Yes . </s>
…willing to give a pass on that… JORGE CASTAÑEDA No . No . I am very glad to hear my very good friend , Ruben Beltran , the Consul General of Mexico in New York , defend the government he works for . </s>
But… JORGE CASTAÑEDA …in the interest of full disclosure… Oh… JORGE CASTAÑEDA …Ruben , it’s always better to be as open as possible on these matters… </s>
Yeah . JORGE CASTAÑEDA …and I have great respect for Ruben’s professional wisdom as a Foreign Service Officer . He was an excellent officer when he served under me , and he continues to be an excellent officer . </s>
OK , we understand . Go ahead . JORGE CASTAÑEDA Yeah . </s>
Just in case… Yeah , yeah . JORGE CASTAÑEDA …if there was a little confusion there… Yeah . </s>
JORGE CASTAÑEDA OK . </s>
I think there is an alternative , I think it is in the book . And of course , in the one or two minutes of the seven I had for this , I did try to lay it out . One of them has to do with not waging a war against all the cartels all the time , but concentrating on limiting collateral damage—that is , violence , kidnappings , corruption , etc.— without necessarily going after the drug trafficking itself , which is essentially what Uribe has done in Colombia . And I go back to the issue : There has been no reduction in coca leaf acreage in Colombia over the past 10 years . </s>
Second , creating a national police force so that you don’t have to use the army . Every time we use the army , we get into human rights violations , we get into corruption of the army . This is a bad idea . We haven’t created a national police force . Zedillo didn’t do it ; Fox , when I was in government , didn’t do it ; and Calderón hasn’t done it . </s>
And until we do that , it won’t work . And that’s another part of the alternative . </s>
OK . JORGE CASTAÑEDA And the third part of the alternative is , once again , moving in the direction of decriminalization , so that we try and reduce the profits for that . And fourthly , yes , there is something to be done in truly sealing the border in Mexico—not at the southern border with Guatemala—but at the , which requires much more cooperation from the United States to do . </s>
What we’d be doing is just pushing the drugs out into the sea coming into the United States , but there is a good case to be made : Drugs want to come to the United States because Americans want to keep consuming them . What we in Mexico are interested , quite honestly , is that they don’t come through Mexico . Hmmm . </s>
Andrés , do you want to be very brief ? ANDRÉS MARTINEZ I just want to very briefly take issue with Jorge’s repeated insistence that this “war” started in December of 2006 . Yes , President Calderón ratcheted up the effort , but as we have been discussing here tonight , this problem in Mexico specifically—but in the broader regions , the region more generally—dates back many decades . And even the year before Calderón took office in 2005 , if you had been living in , you would feel there was a helluva war going on . </s>
So I just wanted to make that clear . Is there… Is there not a single woman in the audience who wants to ask a question here ? </s>
ANDRÉS MARTINEZ OK . ANDRÉS MARTINEZ A single woman or a married woman ? Well , why are you wording it that way ? </s>
But thank you for doing that… </s>
Hi , I am a student at NYU , my name is Alexandria Newton . Thank you guys for being here , and it’s really great to have you on our campus . </s>
But I just wanted to ask . Would either side believe , does… ? </s>
Does either side believe that the international drug wars could have been prevented if Richard Nixon and America didn’t declare that war on drugs ? Asa Hutchinson . Well , I really have problems with the language that Richard—that President Nixon used : “War on Drugs.” I think that’s very unfortunate , because one , it implies an end ; you like to have wars end ; and secondly , it implies too much violence in that name . And so , I , as head of the DEA , resisted using that ; I like to use “the fight against illegal drugs.” </s>
The fight for our families . </s>
You know , reducing , use agent addictions . So I think that is very unfortunate . </s>
In terms of internationally , sure . The United States provides leadership whether it’s in the area of democracy and freedom , or whether it’s in trade . People do respond to the United States , so we have provided some leadership in terms of the fight against illegal drugs . But the bottom line is : Each of those decisions— well , they would never do anything , just because the United States wants them to do it . You look at the Netherlands , for example . </s>
The Netherlands started down the path of decriminalization . They are toughening it up a little bit . </s>
They see some serious problems there . And so every country is making decisions on their own . But I would say , by and large , the consensus historically has been : drugs are harmful . Let’s keep ‘em out of our families . The best way to do that is to keep them illegal . </s>
And that concludes Round 2 of our debate . </s>
Here is where we are . We are about to hear closing statements from each debater . </s>
They will be two minutes each , and it’s their last chance to change your minds . After you hear them speak , you will vote for the final time on where you stand on the motion . But to remind you of where you stood before the debate : Before the debate , our motion being “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” 43 percent of you were for the motion , 22 percent were against , and 35 percent were undecided . We’ll have you vote again in just a few minutes . And we are a short time away from learning who is the winner of this debate . </s>
So Round 3 : closing statements . </s>
And first to summarize his position against our motion “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” Asa Hutchinson , former Congressman , DEA administrator , and Undersecretary for the Department of Homeland Security . Thank you . And I am grateful for this chance to debate with my colleagues in respectful fashion . </s>
If I have been rude , please forgive me . It’s been a very healthy debate . I am a little bit startled by the push toward legalization because I don’t think that is particularly relevant toward the topic . The topic being : Is America to blame ? And quite frankly , if you would have asked the question , “Does America have some responsibility , in terms of their drug consumption , as to the challenges that Mexico faces , ” I would have to agree with that . </s>
But I think that is totally different . </s>
And that’s not your decision today . It is : “Is America to Blame ? ” That implies that we are doing something wrong in our policy . And I don’t believe that we are . </s>
And secondly , it implies that somehow we have made Mexico make these decisions . And I do not believe that the affirmative side has taken that burden of proof . They have not had any facts to support the proposition that somehow the United States has made Calderón—President Calderón—go after the drug cartels . </s>
I think the history is clear from everyone’s statements , that Mexico—and rightfully so—stands tall among the sovereign nations of the world . It was their congress that has said drugs are illegal in their country . It is their culture that has resulted in the society they have that—which there is according to President Calderón , a “culture of corruption” in that country—that they have to address . Historically though , you have to go back 25 and 30 years and these problems are systematic . </s>
They are integral to the history of Mexico . </s>
And the United States is not to blame for that . America is not to blame for what is being phased in Mexico today . They say it’s because we have a consumption problem . That might be debate . </s>
I think the evidence is that marijuana use has declined from the ‘90s from 9.1 percent to 6.8 percent . Asa Hutchinson… It might go up , it might go down . …your time is up . </s>
Thank you . Asa Hutchinson . Our motion is : “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” And now summarizing his position for this motion , Fareed Zakaria , Editor of Newsweek International , and host of CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS . </s>
Thank you all very much . And I want to tell you an anecdote . I was in Singapore about 15 years ago and the leader of Singapore , Lee Kuan Yew—a tough guy who runs a pretty tough shop—was coming under some pressure because he had very strict drug testing programs in Singapore . And he explained the problem to me this way . He said , “You see , you Americans look at things very differently than we do . </s>
When you have a drug problem , you look around and say , ‘Well , where are the drugs coming from ? Panama . Let’s go in and invade Panama , arrest the president , put him in jail , and that’s how we’ll solve the drug problem.’ ” He said , “I don’t have that option in Singapore . </s>
I have got to actually deal with the problem I have in my society . </s>
And for that reason , I am going to have intrusive drug testing.” </s>
I raise this to make two points . </s>
One , you don’t have to believe in decriminalization to believe that we are exporting this problem and have been exporting the war and the criminalization from the Caribbean through Colombia , and now into Mexico . </s>
But the more important point I want to make—and I urge you… You know , it’s often you could look at these things as games . It is very important that America own up to its responsibilities . That we not push the blame on one more poor country , on one more neighbor . That we recognize that we do have something to do with what is going on . </s>
This is a disease in American foreign policy , it is a disease in American society . And it is very important that you and the vote you make—and we as a society— own up to it . There is this wonderful quote from Fitzgerald’s Gatsby that I always remember about Tom and Daisy Buchanan . He says of them—as typical Americans—he says , “They were careless people , Tom and Daisy- they smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness.” </s>
Let’s not be like that . Let’s take responsibility . Thank you , Fareed Zakaria . “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War” is our motion . </s>
And summarizing his position against that motion , Chris Cox , Chief Lobbyist for the National Rifle Association . Thank you . What’s clearly not to blame is America’s Second Amendment or the lack of some law to outlaw what’s already illegal on both sides of the border . To even suggest that this criminal enterprise has anything to do with our rights is absurd . </s>
It’s preposterous . So let me be clear where we come from . Do we support the current administration’s proclaimed conviction to hunt down and root out the drug cartels ? </s>
Absolutely . Do we feel for the poor Mexican people who are being terrorized by narco terrorists ? </s>
They are abandoned by their own officials . They are left defenseless by their own , their own government ? Of course we do , passionately . But we are going to give up our Second Amendment rights on some empty promise that’s going to—this is going to make the Mexican people safer ? Not now , and not ever . </s>
Our rights don’t endanger anyone—and they make this country freer , safer , and a lot more stable than other countries around the world , including Mexico . </s>
American law enforcement can work with the Mexican government , should work and does work with the Mexican law enforcement to bring people to justice who break the law . Collectively , we have the tools , we have the intelligence , we have the manpower , but what we apparently lack is the guts—that straight and high integrity to tell each other the truth on all these issues . </s>
Until we get to that point , until we can look each other in the eye and tell the truth and be honest , this whole question is irrelevant . Thank you . Thank you , Chris Cox . Summarizing for our motion , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” Jeffrey Miron , a senior lecturer and Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Economics at Harvard . Again , thank you very much for being here and for listening . </s>
Let me start by conceding some elements of merit in my opponents’ points . First , I think Mr. Cox is absolutely right , U.S. gun policy has nothing to do with the issue . </s>
There would be just as much of a drug war , just as much violence , if we banished U.S. guns ; the guns would come from somewhere else . I think Mr. Hutchinson has a fair point . Countries are meant to be sovereign . Mexico could , in principle , say “We don’t care what U.S. policy is . </s>
We don’t care about NAFTA . </s>
We don’t care how much the U.S. is harassing us . We are going to legalize drugs , ” or “We are going to de-escalate our own drug wars , because that’s a sensible thing to do.” In principle , could they do that on their own ? Yes . Would they come under enormous international pressure and U.S. pressure ? </s>
Absolutely . So I think he is painting much , much too optimistic a case . I think that Jorge Castañeda has a very valid point . </s>
Certainly , the situation got much worse when Calderón escalated , OK ? </s>
And the degree to which you try to enforce a “drug war” plays a huge role in how bad it is . Many European countries have laws which are not so different than the U.S. laws , but they basically do almost nothing to try to enforce them . </s>
They leave the cartels , they leave the suppliers basically alone , and they don’t get nearly the magnitude of the violence and other negative side effects . So there is certainly a valid point there as well . I would also note , I think , that four of the six of us here could agree that we would have liked the question to have been , “Should the U.S. and Mexico de-escalate their war on drugs , ” OK ? And I think the three of us here—along with Jorge—would all agree with…in the affirmative for that . </s>
So perhaps we can have another discussion on that point . </s>
But at the end of the day , the fact is that the U.S.—throughout the last 90 years—has done everything in its power to push its Puritanical , Prohibitionist message and policy on the rest of the world , Mexico being very much at the forefront , and going back well before Felipe Calderón . So yes , America is to blame for the for the drug wars in Mexico . Thank you , Jeffrey Miron . </s>
Summarizing against our motion , Jorge Castañeda , former Foreign Minister of Mexico , and here at New York University , Professor of Political Silence—sorry , Political… Oh… JORGE CASTAÑEDA As my students can testify… Yes , yeah . </s>
Well , let me finish , let me finish my windup for you , without the Freudian slip . Jorge Castañeda , former Foreign Minister of Mexico , and Professor of Political Science and Latin American Studies at New York University . </s>
JORGE CASTAÑEDA I am very glad to hear at this point that , yes , at least four of us— and I am not so sure , well , perhaps , well , the rest of my members of my team would disagree entirely that the way this war has been declared , waged and is being fought , perhaps was not the most intelligent idea and that perhaps a series of modifications should be made . But in any case , on the fundamental issue . I think that if we accept the premise that the United States is to blame for the war—which I do not , because as I said , I think this is President Calderón’s war , and it did begin now . The previous six presidents of Mexico have contained with more or less corruption , more or less violence , more or less intelligence , the cartels , but did not declare this generalized war on them . </s>
The first time that has happened is now . </s>
The question is : Is there any change in the United States’ situation…in the last two or three years…that has had a direct impact on Mexican production , violence , corruption , etc. ? And there is no evidence of that . I would just respectfully disagree with my colleague Asa on the question of U.S. demand . Fareed brought it up , and he is right . I don’t know what “demand” has been , but I do know—from DEA figures—that the price of drugs in the United States over the last 40 years has tended to decrease for all drugs . Now , it may be that some “demand” has dropped and prices have also dropped , but that is hard to argue directly . </s>
My sense is that , overall , demand has been more or less stable for all drugs , except for changes within them . And on the gun question , I also think that there is no significant change . It’s not that all of a sudden there are more guns going to Mexico . </s>
There are a lot though . Fareed , I would tend to disagree with “the 2,000 per day , ” that’s 700,000 per year . That would be two million , just in the past three years . </s>
The numbers don’t add up . And by the way , there are three million registered guns in Mexico , including those of the government . There are more than two and a half billion registered , legal gun owners in Mexico today . Thank you , Jorge Castañeda . </s>
And finally , with our motion , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War , ” summarizing for the motion , Andrés Martinez , Director of the New America Foundation , Bernard L. Schwartz Fellows Program , and a former editor at the L.A. Times . ANDRÉS MARTINEZ Thank you . And again , I want to reiterate my appreciation for your being here and for the Rosenkranz Foundation for hosting this important forum . First off , I just quickly wanted to take issue again with Jorge on this question of whether the drug war started under President Calderón . </s>
And yes , there was a “surge , ” if you will—or a “frontal declaration against all cartels , all the time , ” as you put it . But I think the alternative… It’s very cynical to say , “Well , the government should have continued accommodating with these cartels.” </s>
And clearly , this day of reckoning was in the offing when— sooner or later . But I think , again , America is to blame for the violence , for the war . Asa Hutchinson said , “We offered no facts , we offered no evidence.” I just point you again to a 65 billion dollar consumption demand for this , these illicit drugs in this country . </s>
I think the fact that we have spent so much time talking about whether or not to legalize is indicative—and again , I am agnostic on that question—but I think it’s indicative that we all understand that the root cause here is the fact that we have this massive market in this country for a product that we have also made illegal . </s>
65 billion dollars is more than 5 percent of Mexico’s GDP . According to Jorge’s fantastic book , Mexico has a consumption—illicit drug consumption rates—that are below international averages . Only 5 percent of Mexicans have ever tried illegal drugs , compared to 42 percent of Americans . When I was a kid , they used to make stamps , “Mexico Exporta , ” stamps of export products . They could have…might as well made illicit drugs . </s>
This is all about supply and demand . It’s all about supplying the American market . 90 percent of the cocaine that is consumed in this country now goes through Mexico , because of some of the shifts that Fareed mentioned earlier . We have to accept that our actions have consequences . </s>
We can’t constantly outsource the repercussions of our hypocrisy . Please accept responsibility and vote with us that America is to blame for Mexico’s drug war . And that concludes our closing statements . And now it is time to learn which side argued best . </s>
You are going to choose our winner . Once again , going to the keypads near your seat . </s>
You voted before the debate . </s>
Your position on our motion , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” We would like to ask you to vote once again on this position , having heard the arguments . Press number 1 if you support the motion , number 2 if you are against , and number 3 if you remain or became undecided . The motion , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” And it looks like everyone is done . </s>
We are going to have the results probably in about 90 seconds . In the meantime , I want to tell you what’s coming up in our next season . First of all , I want to thank all of you in the audience and our panel for a compelling discussion and for arguing honestly , fairly and good naturedly . </s>
So this is our last debate of 2009 . </s>
And looking forward to 2010 , here is what we are going to be debating at this point in our spring series . On January 19th , our motion is “California is the first failed state.” It will feature former Governor Gray Davis and Van Jones , who recently left his post as White House environmental advisor . </s>
On February 9th , the motion is “The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel.” We are going to have New York Times columnist Roger Cohen and Columbia University pressure—or professor Rashid Khalidi , and Israel’s former Ambassador to the United States , Itamar Rabinovitz . On March 16th , the motion is “Don’t blame teachers unions for our failing schools.” We’ll have former Education Secretary Rod Paige . April 13th , “Organic food is marketing hype.” </s>
We’ll have Blue Hill chef Dan Barber , and Vogue food writer Jeffrey Steingarten . Finally , on May 11th , the motion will be “Give every U.S. educated Ph.D. a Green Card.” </s>
We’ll have Intel’s Craig Barrett as part of that panel . Individual tickets and packages are now available by visiting our Web site , and at the Skirball box office . </s>
And make sure to become a fan of Intelligence Squared U.S. on Facebook , and you will receive discount on next season’s debates . And finally , a special thank you to NPR and to Bloomberg Television for distributing the IQ2 debates this season , and to our media partner Newsweek magazine . Don’t forget to pick up a copy on your way out . And now it is in . You have voted twice . </s>
And I have just been given the results . Remember , the side that changes the most minds here will be declared our winner . </s>
Our motion has been , “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” Before the debate , 43 percent of you were for the motion , 22 percent of you were against , and 35 percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , 72 percent of you are for the motion , 22 percent remain against , and 6 percent undecided . The side for the motion wins . </s>
Congratulations to that side . And thank you from me , John Donvan , and Intelligence Squared U.S . </s>
And now to open what is our spring season of our fifth year of Intelligence Squared U.S. the chairman of the organization that makes it all possible , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Well thank you all . </s>
Thank you all for braving the weather to come and for joining us tonight . You know I do have in addition to my role on Intelligence Squared a day job and it’s running an insurance company which gets around two percent of its premiums from medical insurance . So this debate is not very material to our business but I thought I should share that fact with you in the interest of full disclosure . You know , I also want to share some of my own insurance expertise as it relates to tonight’s motion . </s>
What seems clear to me is that healthcare costs are out of control . They amount to around 16 percent of the U.S. economy compared to nine percent in other rich countries . </s>
Health costs have been a major drag on employment and growth and have jeopardized the financial position of the federal government , state governments and frankly we have no better health outcomes to show for these costs . </s>
In considering the arguments of our panelists tonight , you might want to think about the effect of this bill on costs . There is a credible argument that the bill makes a serious effort to address Medicare costs in particular . </s>
After all , some 30 percent of all healthcare costs in America are incurred in the last hundred and eighty days of life . Some Republicans , by the way , have been quite disingenuous about this , raising the specter of “death panels” and World War II vets languishing without appropriate care . </s>
But another major driver of out-of-control costs are tort lawyers , medical malpractice insurance premiums and especially the defense of cover-you-rear medicine that they foster . </s>
Democrats , traditional allies of the tort bar , have hardly been forthright about this aspect of the situation . Another factor is that consumers of health care generally have little incentive to control costs . Why should they economize if insurance companies are paying ? Most insurance covers things you can’t budget . Car insurance doesn’t cover oil changes . </s>
Home owners insurance doesn’t cover a soiled rug . </s>
But when it comes to health insurance , we expect coverage of every conceivable medical benefit . Most insurance policies are priced to reflect risk . Teenagers pay more for auto insurance . Smokers pay more for life insurance and so forth . But for health coverage , most states have mandated that everyone in the community pays the same . </s>
What this means is that healthy young people pay excessive premiums they can’t well afford in order to subsidize their better-off but more illness prone elders . They often quite rationally elect to not buy the over-priced coverage . This bill would force them to do so . But whether requiring someone to purchase something they don’t want is even constitutional will surely be touched on in tonight’s debate . </s>
So in considering the arguments you’ll hear this evening , I encourage you to listen with the following kinds of questions in mind . </s>
Does the bill address unproductive and undignified end-of-life care ? </s>
Does it rein in tort lawyers to discourage defensive medicine ? Does it encourage us as consumers to care about what we spend ? Does it provide appropriate incentives for healthy life styles and preventive care ? These are not rhetorical questions . </s>
But they’re very complex just like the bill we’re discussing . We have a stellar roster of panelists to help illuminate these issues and it’s now my pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator , John Donvan . Thank you very much . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Robert . </s>
And I would just like another round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz . Two words , “Repeal Obamacare , ” that is our motion . That is what we are here to debate . I’m John Donvan of ABC News at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University and on hundreds of NPR stations across the nation for another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. “Repeal Obamacare , ” and to debate this motion we have a congressman , presidential advisers , and a man who has written more about the topic than anybody , I think we can say literally . </s>
And in this debate , we want you to listen carefully because you are a live audience . You act as our judges . By the time this debate has ended , you will have been asked to vote two times , once before the debate and once again afterwards . </s>
And the team that has been most persuasive , that has changed most of your minds will be declared our winner . So let 's go to our preliminary vote . Go to those key pads at the right hand side of your seat . Our motion is `` Repeal Obamacare . '' And if you agree with this motion , push number one . </s>
If you 're for repeal , it 's number one . </s>
If you disagree , it you are against repeal , it 's number two . If you are undecided , it 's number three . </s>
And if you feel that you 've made an error , just correct it , and the system will lock in your last vote . And you can ignore the other keys . All right . We 're locking out the system , and we will present the results of both votes at the end of the debate . So on to round one . </s>
Our motion is it `` Repeal Obamacare . '' And first , to argue for this motion , for repeal , I 'd like to introduce John Shadegg , a congressman from Arizona . </s>
Let me say , former congressman . After eight terms , John Shadegg decided to step away from the job which is not something that a lot of people in your position -- actually , he tried twice . The first time -- the first time your fellow Republicans asked you not to leave . That 's true . Finally , you got away , John . </s>
And they liked your rhetoric , which included on this topic a reference to the Obama reform program as Soviet style gulag healthcare . I want to say , come now . Hey . </s>
Do you stand by that ? </s>
No . I think that it is a -- it is a part of the dialogue that you try to get attention . And that was an attempt to gather some attention . </s>
And it worked . We 'll see what else you have to say tonight . Ladies and gentlemen , John Shadegg . </s>
Thank you very much , John . And thank you to the audience . You play a key role here tonight . I want to thank Intelligence Squared for sponsoring this debate . And I want to recognize my opponents , one of whom has written more than anybody else in the world on this topic . </s>
And most of all , I want to thank my debate partner , Douglas Holtz-Eakin , former CBO director and a senior policy advisor to Senator John McCain . My partner , Douglas Holtz-Eakin is a numbers guy , and he will focus on the numbers . And I believe he will be able to clearly show you that Obamacare both wo n't work and perhaps more importantly , will put a critical strain on our nation 's fiscal stability . </s>
Let me begin , however , by refuting two arguments . First , supporters of Obamacare will say that Republicans simply do n't believe in healthcare and indeed that they favor the status quo . </s>
That is simply wrong . I believe in my tenure in Congress I had written more healthcare reform bills than any other member of Congress . I wrote a number of patients rights bills in the early debate . But I was also joined throughout this with the help of Paul Ryan and Tom Coburn and Jim DeMint and Richard Burr and Dr. Tom Price and Dr. Burgess and on and on . </s>
And you would find countless proposals by Republicans to reform our nation 's healthcare . Second , supporters of Obamacare will tell you that it will actually save the government money . And they will tell you that repealing it will cost the government money . Now , Douglas Holtz-Eakin will demonstrate with the numbers that those claims are unfounded . But I urge you to begin by just looking at this question with common sense . </s>
Obamacare insures roughly 32 million additional Americans , most through Medicaid . </s>
That will increase costs . It creates a massive new bureaucracy , some 150 plus agencies and bureaus . That 's got to increase costs . </s>
And it extends dramatic new mandates over health insurance in America . And that will increase costs . Now , let me move on to one point that I think is very important to understand . </s>
The current system is in fact broken . </s>
As I said , I have written numerous bills to try to fix it . Costs are way too high , and they 're going up too quickly . There are too many uninsured and too many Americans have pre-existing conditions and can not get affordable coverage . I have a pre-existing condition , and I have an older sister who has -- who is a breast cancer survivor , probably the worst kind of pre-existing condition . </s>
One aspect of the current system is in fact indefensible . </s>
It 's the provision that says your employee-provided care is tax free . It costs them no taxes and you no taxes . But it punishes those without employee-provided care . </s>
Indeed , it tells them , we want you to get insurance so much we 're going to force you to pay for it with after-tax dollars , making it a third more expensive . That is simply outrageous and indefensible . And stunningly , Obamacare does not fix that problem . Obamacare is simply the wrong answer . First , it addresses symptoms , namely the uninsured , which are too high . </s>
But it does not address , I do not believe appropriately , certainly not with incentives , cost . Second , it will not only increase the cost to the government , but it will drive up your premiums . </s>
And the experts agree on that point . It moves -- and perhaps this is most important -- healthcare decision making away from employers and the insurance companies they hire , and they 're making lousy decisions , and they should n't be deciding . </s>
But it does n't give those decisions to you and me . </s>
It gives them to the government . What we need to do is take decision making away from employers and insurance companies and give it to people . </s>
Give it to patients , individuals and their families , and let them consult with their doctor and make those decisions . Republican proposals in Congress do exactly that . Why ? Because if the health insurance is yours , not your employer 's and not the government 's , it 's personal , and it belongs to you . You can make the changes . </s>
You are n't trapped in a plan your employer picked . You can force the insurance companies to compete , which they do n't do now . </s>
You can hire the plan of your choice . And because it 's yours , you can fire it , meaning you can hold it accountable to you . Briefly , let me touch on why Obamacare will drive costs up . By its terms , Obamacare institutes lots of mandates . </s>
One is guaranteed issue , meaning nobody can be turned down . That will increase cost . One is modified community rating . </s>
That will increase costs . </s>
And a third is an array of new benefit mandates . All of those will increase costs . Indeed , in every state , with guaranteed issue and community rating , and in every state where they mandated more and more benefits , costs have gone up dramatically . </s>
In Massachusetts , after adopting a plan very similar to Obamacare , costs have continued to go up at a rate faster than the national average . </s>
Let me touch on some of Obamacare 's broken promises . The president told us over and over , and quite frankly , over again , that if you like your plan , you can keep it . Not true . He said if you like your doctor , you can keep it . You can keep him or her . </s>
Not true . And he said that Obamacare would send the cost curve down . None of those promises , as we examine the plan , turn out to be true . </s>
The Medicare actuary has already estimated that some 14 million people will lose their current coverage . Leading experts say few plans will actually survive . How could they survive ? They have to meet benefit mandates that have n't even yet been written . In fact , thousands of Americans will lose their employer-provided healthcare because their small employer or large employer can not afford to continue to offer it . </s>
They will lose their healthcare . </s>
AT & T , a study was done and provided to the commerce committee that showed AT & T will save $ 2 billion , $ 2 billion if they cancel their employees ' care and pay the fine . John Deere will lose $ 150 million a year . Caterpillar , $ 100 million a year . 3M , $ 90 million a year . The numbers go on and on . </s>
Those employers will have no choice to their stockholders but to drop that care . They 'll be forced . And think about their workers . Their workers will lose their current plan , and they 'll lose their doctor . We simply have to do better than that . </s>
The new , indeed , one provision of the law is outrageously unfair , as unfair as the tax code is now . It provides , in the new healthcare exchanges , that if you are uninsured , or if you buy in the individual market , you can enjoin the exchange . And if you join the exchange , you can get a government subsidy . </s>
But if you have employer-provided care , you can not join the exchange . That simply is n't fair because it means the cost of your care is subsidized , some with the exact same income can not get subsidized care . John Shadegg , your time is up . </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you very much . Thank you , John Shadegg . We 're debating a motion , `` Repeal Obamacare '' in this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . And now to argue against the motion , Paul Starr , who is a professor of sociology and public affairs at Princeton . </s>
He 's a Pulitzer Prize winner for his book on healthcare called “The Social Transformation of American Medicine.” </s>
Paul , you also were an advisor to President Clinton the first time the Democrats tried to pull off a major reform and failed . What got right this time that you got wrong last time to at least get the act -- get the law passed ? Well , I think one of the big differences this time was more consensus . </s>
Might seem strange in the light of what Congressman Shadegg has said , but more consensus among Democrats in Congress , consensus between the White House and Congress , more consensus also with the stakeholder groups in healthcare who realize that the current course is unsustainable , that we need to change and -- </s>
Well , let me let you get launched on your seven minutes . Okay , well , because -- </s>
I feel like I should deduct . All right . I 'm joking . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Paul Starr . Thank you . We should uphold the Affordable Care Act because it is morally the right thing to do and it is in our common interest . </s>
And when I first began work on the healthcare back in the 1970s , the official number for the uninsured was 26 million , 12 percent of the population . By the early '90s , it was up to 37 million . Now it 's reached 50 million . </s>
And if we were to do the kinds of things that the Congressman has advocated , the number will go higher . Fifty million , that 's already a lot of people for whom illness is devastating , who may lose everything they have because of illness . For years surveys have shown that anxiety about not being able to pay for the healthcare you need ranks at the top of Americans ' anxieties . </s>
And Americans are more likely -- much more likely than people in the other rich democracies to put off getting medical care for fear of the cost . </s>
Still , the majority of Americans , and I guess most of the people here tonight , do have insurance , and it 's tricky to figure out how to help the millions who get a raw deal while protecting the interests of those who already have protection . The Affordable Care Act is an intelligently crafted effort to do that . It extends coverage in two ways , by expanding Medicaid for poor people who 've been cut out of that program , and by creating insurance exchanges where other people can easily and efficiently buy a private insurance plan under a new set of rules that , for example , prevent insurers from excluding preexisting conditions , and where subsidies are available to keep the premium for a medium leveled package at no more than eight percent of income . Now , the insurance exchange is not just a hypothetical concept . Massachusetts has a working exchange , The Health Connector , adopted as part of the reforms introduced by Governor Mitt Romney and passed overwhelmingly by both parties . </s>
If you move to Massachusetts , you can use The Connector 's website and , in half an hour , sign up for an insurance plan , no broker 's fees , no hassle . No wonder brokers don’t like the idea of the insurance exchange but we don’t kill off Expedia or Travelocity for the sake of the travel agents , do we ? And currently , if you buy coverage individually or through a small business , and if we all bought coverage individually the way the Congressman wants , 30 cents or more out of every premium dollar gets sucked up in administrative and marketing costs . The exchanges are just one way the reform squeezes out costs from the system . </s>
In regard to coverage , the Affordable Care Act is modeled on the Massachusetts reforms . It does a lot more on cost containment , and far from being a government takeover , the program aims to create a better functioning market for private insurance . </s>
The origins of this idea go back to old Republicans -- Republican proposals , to a plan that Richard Nixon proposed in 1974 , and to a bill introduced by Senator John Chafee , with 20 Republican cosponsors , back in 1981 -- 1991 , a bill by the way that had an individual mandate in it . And substantively , the Affordable Care Act is bipartisan legislation . We just don’t happen to live in a bipartisan political era . Consider the law 's moderate responsible approach to financing . </s>
The basic idea is to find most of the money to expand coverage from within the healthcare system . We spend enough on healthcare , we just don’t allocate it well . Healthcare providers and insurers will get more than 30 million new paying customers , and since the law 's purpose is not to provide them with windfall profits , it claws back some of the revenue , for example , by reducing the future growth in Medicare payments , and by cutting excessive payments to private Medicare plans . The law also imposes a tax on high cost health plans that really should bring a smile to Douglas Holtz-Eakin because he defended a proposal that was functionally identical when he was John McCain’s Health Policy Advisor . Our Republican friends will tell you that this legislation will explode the deficit , even though the CBO tells us it will reduce the deficit . </s>
Now , Jon is my partner in this . Jon Cohn is going to talk more about cost . But while you 're listening to the other side , please bear in mind that when Bill Clinton left office we were looking at a $ 3.1 trillion surplus back then . And Bush came in , cut taxes , passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit with no financing , sent us to war in Iraq without taxes to pay for it and , of course , the deficit exploded . It exploded on their watch leaving us in the end with a financial crisis and the great recession . </s>
What happened to health care costs in that period , in the years between 2001 and 2006 when Republicans had control of both the White House and Congress ? </s>
What did they do about health care costs ? Here are the facts . Family health insurance premiums went up 87 percent compared to 20 percent increase in general inflation and a decline of three percent in real median household income . Faced with a potential death spiral in the individual and small group markets , many of the interest groups that opposed healthcare reform in the past , the American Medical Association , the hospitals , the for- profit hospitals , too , even many of the insurers decided that the current situation had to be changed . </s>
And that’s why we got legislation in 2010 and not just because of the Democrats but because so many in healthcare saw it was wrong and worked to make it -- to change it . Now just a word on Mr. Shadegg’s proposals . We have low-regulation states , states that don’t regulate the insurance industry . </s>
His own state of Arizona is one of those states and their costs are just as high as elsewhere . Arizona has 20 percent uninsured . The high deductible insurance policies combined with tax-advantage savings accounts that he and other Republicans favor and put into law haven’t shown any sign of reducing costs or extending coverage . </s>
They are , however , a great tax shelter and in fact if you’re in a high tax bracket , it’s great to have a health savings account . </s>
You can put money in the account , don’t even use it for healthcare and withdraw it after age 65 without penalty . So those are proposals that are great for people who are healthy and well-off . They just don’t happen to do much for the low-income workers and the others who really face the difficulties in paying for healthcare . Sir , your time is up . </s>
Thank you very much . We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I’m John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We have four debaters , two teams of two , who are fighting it out over this motion , “Repeal Obamacare.” You have heard from the first two debaters and now on to the third . </s>
To argue for the motion , to argue for the repeal of Obamacare , I’d like to introduce Douglas Holtz-Eakin , who is president of the American Action Forum . He was with the McCain campaign as an adviser and in his critiques of the Obama health plan , came up with the telling phrase , “fantasy in , fantasy out.” I believe that’s yours . </s>
You own that . You also -- Not very profitable but I own it . </s>
Yes . I also learned through Google another delicious fact -- you were a good sport about it -- but after leaving the McCain campaign , you couldn’t get health insurance for some time . </s>
Not exactly right but I have a pre-existing condition . </s>
Actually , I have two kidneys on my left side from some extensive work before the 21st Century and I was left on COBRA coverage and the solution , of course , is to start your own employer so I started a think tank to get insurance . So you’re covered . I am covered . </s>
You took it the hard way . Ladies and gentlemen , Douglas Holtz-Eakin . Thank you . </s>
So thank you very much for the chance to be here tonight to our sponsors and to our opponents . You know , I’m going to ask you to support the motion but in the end , you’ve all realized that what we’re debating tonight is about getting healthcare reform in the United States because there is no dispute about the need for healthcare reform . My own history , John’s history , probably the histories on the other side of the table of which I’m unaware are stark tribute to the need to do things better in the United States . </s>
Real healthcare reform has two pieces . Number one , it extends healthcare coverage to Americans , gives them options for insurance and insurance is a product which shifts around the cost of your healthcare . </s>
In the end , an insurance system takes the nation’s health care bill and shifts around who picks up the ultimate cost , moving it from some people who are unable to shoulder the full burden of the cost of their care to some others who may be able to . The second piece , the piece that drives everything , is the overall healthcare bill . </s>
And the United States has a health care bill which is far too large and certainly far too large for what we get . </s>
At one-sixth of our economy , it’s one of the most inefficient pieces of economics that one could imagine . </s>
And the key fact to remember in thinking about this debate is that over the past four decades . If you look at income per person in the United States and healthcare spending per person , the resources versus the costs , costs have been winning at two to two and a half percentage points every year for four decades . Republicans , Democrats alike . It is the costs and the spending on healthcare that ultimately has to be covered by insurance premiums . </s>
And if you do n't control costs , you can not control insurance premiums , and you can not deal with extending coverage to Americans , which is ultimately what real healthcare reform is about . I favor repeal because this reform flunks the test of healthcare reform . </s>
It does not deal with the cost problem . Now , I do n't need to say so . Many people , far more qualified than I , have said so . The Congressional Budget Office , in the aftermath of passage of the Affordable Care Act , put out its new long-term care -- or its new long-term budget projections . Did health spending in the federal budget grow more slowly as a result of this ? </s>
No , it does not . You can look at the CMS actuary , the administration , the Obama administration 's own chief actuary , Richard Foster , who estimates that the affordable care actually will raise national healthcare spending , not lower it , and will actually endanger the future of Medicare , not make it more solid . You can ask Jonathan Gruber . Jonathan Gruber is one of the architects of Obamacare . He 's one of the architects of the Massachusetts reform on which Obamacare was founded . </s>
And in his article in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management , he says , “This is n't about cost reform . This is health insurance reform . There 's nothing in it . </s>
Much like Massachusetts , it 's just about covering people . It does n't control costs.” And you can look at the experience in Massachusetts where , prior to reform , Massachusetts had costs that were 25 percent higher than the national average . And after reform , they were at 30 percent higher than the national average , no improvement in the fundamental requirement of healthcare reform . </s>
So we need to get the healthcare reform . And without that , we will never control the budgetary costs that threaten our nation . Now , I 'm a former CBO director . It is my obligation to stand up in public and say apocalyptic things about the budgetary future . I 'll spare you the numbers tonight because I like you more than my children . </s>
But the bottom line is this nation , looking forward -- forget re-litigating the past . Mr. Starr is good at that . </s>
But looking forward in the administration’s budget 10 years from now , after the financial crisis is in memory , after we’re soon to be out of Iraq , out of Iran , after the economy is back at five percent unemployment , we are running a deficit of a trillion dollars . </s>
Nine hundred billion of it 's to pay interest on previous borrowing . We are headed to that magical position where we 're borrowing to pay previous borrowing and nothing else . </s>
Along the road , we will pass the criteria for downgrade as a sovereign nation . We will no longer be a top- rated borrower . This act makes that situation worse , not better . It says that two new open-ended entitlement programs that will grow , according to CBO , at eight percent a year , as far as the eye can see , the economy is not going to grow at eight percent . Revenue 's not going to grow at eight percent . </s>
The only way you could make that kind of a move add up budgetarily is smoke , mirrors and gimmicks . And that 's what the Affordable Care Act is riddled with , in which the CBO was forced to acknowledge in its score . </s>
If you give them handcuffs , they 'll come up with any answer that you might want . </s>
So we ca n't afford this as a nation . It is dangerous because it does n't control costs . It 's not really healthcare reform . You need to vote for healthcare reform , not Obamacare . One sixth of our economy is underperforming . </s>
If we care about economic performance , we should repeal Obamacare . </s>
Forget the mandates , forget the taxes . We had a system that was broken to begin with . </s>
One-sixth of our economy is broken . Why not fix it instead of writing checks and papering over it ? But you hear some other arguments from the other side , the popular ones , now , the issues of fairness . </s>
Let us stipulate this is one of the most unfair pieces of legislation ever passed . </s>
There are the inequities between two people similarly situated , making $ 70,000 . </s>
One 's going to get $ 7,000 in federal subsidies , 10 percent of their income . The other 's going to get zip . That is grotesquely unfair . And if any future Congress acts pass one , it 'll get solved in a nanosecond . They 'll give everybody the money . </s>
And my first problem will blow up even worse . Terrible idea . And for every young person in this audience , this is a disaster . Through the individual mandate you 'll be obligated to be in the pool . </s>
The purpose is to put you in there to pay the healthcare bills of people who are older and sicker than you . And at the end of your life , you get to pick up the debt that 's been incurred through Obamacare . You 'll get it at the front end . You 'll get it at the back end . </s>
It is one of the most inter-generationally unfair things that has ever been scripted by the United States Congress . Should be repealed on those grounds alone . There are other sort of detours along the way . The insurance companies , that 's where all the costs come from . </s>
Oh , my God , there are administrative costs . There are profits . The top 10 insurance companies in 2009 made $ 260 billion . </s>
That 's a lot of money . I 'd like to have it . The cost growth problem every year is $ 175 billion . So go for it . </s>
Nationalize the insurance companies , confiscate their profits . You get about a year and a half 's worth of relief , and we 're right back where we were . </s>
This is n't about insurance companies . This is about fundamental changes to the delivery system so that we coordinate care so that we deliver high quality care at lower costs . And the greatest missed opportunity here was the chance to fix Medicare , which is at the root of our problems . Medicare pays doctors . </s>
It pays hospitals . It pays some insurance companies , and it pays drug companies . And it has silos to pay them all . </s>
And nowhere in there can you find a beneficiary . Nowhere in there can you get coordination of care . Nowhere in there is the kind of healthcare Americans deserve . We should fix that first . </s>
We should repeal this now . Thank you . Thank you , Douglas Holtz-Eakin . Our motion , `` Repeal Obamacare '' and our final speaker in opening statements to speak against the motion , Jonathan Cohn who is a senior editor at the New Republic . </s>
He wrote a book called “Sick : The Untold Story of America 's Healthcare Crisis , ” which in some ways explains his evolution from pure journalist into advocate with these scores and scores of stories of people in dire straits that he reported and is very passionate about . You also had a blog throughout the debate called The Treatment . And you signed off , after the legislation passed , saying , and I quote you , `` The debate has ended . '' So why are we here ? I like to think it 's been a full employment act for people like me who write about healthcare . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Jonathan Cohn . Thank you . I want to thank the audience . I want to thank the foundation . </s>
I want to thank my opponents . I want to thank Doug Holtz-Eakin in particular for some of the comments he just made about the dire fiscal straits of the country , the importance of trying to get healthcare costs under control because if we do n't get healthcare costs under control , we 're not only going to bankrupt our government , we 're going to bankrupt our entire society . And you know , I agree with all of that . I do . Where we differ you may -- as you may imagine , is that I happen to think the Affordable Care Act , Obamacare , helps us in that regard . </s>
Now , you listened to this team over here . </s>
You 've listened to their argument . </s>
And they painted a very dire picture of a program out of control that 's going to cost more than anybody thinks . It 's going to leave us all paying tons in insurance premiums . And you know , they have to paint an apocalyptic picture because I think the honest truth is most of us , when we hear that -- about the benefits of the plan , that we 'll be able to guarantee coverage for people who have pre-existing conditions , the right to appeal treatments when their insurance company turns it down , subsidies for people who ca n't buy coverage now . </s>
People like that . </s>
They think that is a good idea . So they focus on this cost question . And , you know , during the healthcare debate , we had all this scare talk about death panels and other things that just were simply not in the -- with all due respect to my -- to our debating opponents here who I know have spent a lot of time talking about it , I think they 're giving you , well , I do n't want so say they 're making things up out of whole costs , but I think they 're giving you a slightly , let 's say , one-sided picture of things . So I did two things here . </s>
First , I want to explain why I have faith that the Obama healthcare bill will in fact reduce costs . And I want to specifically go through some of the arguments they have made and tell you why they are misleading . Now , why do I have faith that this healthcare bill will save money ? </s>
I mean is n't -- Congressman Shadegg said , is n't it common sense that it wo n't ? I do n't think it 's common sense . </s>
I look around the world . I look at countries like France and Germany and Switzerland and Japan , countries that get just as good healthcare as we do or better , people who have easier access to healthcare , and yet they spend less than we do . Now , is there something about the United States that we 're not capable ? We 're not innovative enough ? We ca n't do that ? </s>
I do n't think so . Certainly it is possible , certainly , to get excellent healthcare , cover everybody and save money . So the question is , will this bill do it ? And I believe it will . </s>
Let me take a second to explain how the bill is designed to do that . It has three basic approaches . One is to get the low-hanging fruit of healthcare , the waste . </s>
A lot of it 's corporate welfare . </s>
Right now , for example , insurance companies that provide benefits through Medicare , study after study has shown that we pay them too much . They 're making too much in profits . So we say we 're going to take some of that back . We 're going to take back that corporate welfare . </s>
Another source of offsetting revenue for the healthcare program is to go and ask people who have benefited the most from our economy , the people who are the very wealthiest in our society , to pay back a little more in taxes . </s>
And we get money from there . Now , I do n't think either of those propositions are in dispute in terms of that those things will generate money to offset the costs of the healthcare plan . Now , they may not like those ideas . </s>
And that 's fine . And maybe in the question and answer period they can tell us why they think we need to keep giving insurance companies corporate welfare . Why the richest people in this country , who are enjoying far lower tax rates than they had during the Clinton administration , ca n't afford to pay a little more . But it 's the third part of healthcare reform , the third part of cost control that 's the most important . And this is where we really look at the way the American medical care system works . </s>
Everybody who is -- every expert left and right says we waste a ton of money in our medical care system . </s>
Some of this is administrative waste because everyone 's dealing with 10 different insurance companies . Some of this is duplicative treatments because Dr. A does n't know what Dr. B is doing to patient C. Some of this is the fact that we pay tons of money for treatments that do n't work . </s>
The Obama healthcare bill , what it does is it tries to attack those , and it tries dozens of different approaches , and it 's not a liberal takeover , it is not something crazy extremists cooked up on one side , it 's actually the best ideas of the left and the right . It 's ideas like not paying hospitals if they run high rates of in-hospital infection . It 's things like developing electronic medical records so we can keep track of what patients are getting as they move through the medical system . It 's about giving financial incentives to doctors and hospitals that coordinate care and focus on prevention , and efforts like this that together , the smartest people have stated this , all believe will help control healthcare costs . Now , Douglas Holtz-Eakin got up here and said these numbers are crazy , that of course this is going to explode the deficit , and again , common sense , well , the most reliable authority we have on this is the Congressional Budget Office . </s>
Congressional Budget Office is the gold standard of accounting . The CBO -- my reading of the CBO report is that they looked at the healthcare bill and they said , `` You know what ? This bill will reduce the deficit . </s>
It will reduce the deficit in the first 10 years , it will reduce it by a lot more afterwards . '' </s>
And by the way , the rate of growth in healthcare spending is going to start to slow down . Now , it is true that the CBO , you can say , `` Well , the CBO ought to use these rules , '' or whatever . Well , what the CBO rules mean is that we are assuming that the laws that we have passed are going to be implemented , and that is the way -- and that is the way the government accounting system works . </s>
Douglas Holtz-Eakin says , `` Well , that never works because we 've never seen it happen . '' Well , you know what ? It 's happened before . During the late 1990s we tried to control costs in Medicare and we did for a while . </s>
We passed very large cuts to Medicare during the Balanced Budget Act . </s>
It was the late 1990s , and you know what ? Those cuts stuck , and we were able to reduce the growth of Medicare from where it would’ve been otherwise . It’s entirely possible to do this . Now , in order to do this you have to actually stick with a program . </s>
As my colleague mentioned , during the Bush administration they passed a different -- they tried to approach healthcare in a different way . They said , “All right , let’s try a different approach , and let’s have a healthcare bill , let 's not pay the cost for it.” Well , that did increase the deficit , and that is the sort of choice we’re talking about facing here . </s>
Now , my colleague -- my opponent , Mr. Holtz-Eakin , cited a number of authorities he believed , and he said , “Well , John Gruber of MIT says this is not good , ” or he said , “The CMS actuary said this . '' </s>
Well , in fact , if you look at the written record , the people -- the list of experts who have endorsed this , it’s not just the Congressional Budget Office , it’s people like David Cutler , a professor at Harvard University , who won the John Base Clark Medal for the most accomplished economist under 40 . It 's people like Jonathan Gruber from MIT -- I know he quoted Jonathan Gruber -- Jonathan Gruber has said many times he endorses this bill . He thinks it 's our best shot right now to get healthcare costs under control . It 's people like Mark McClellan , who hasn said that he believes the Affordable Care Act will start to reduce healthcare spending , and why do we care about Mark McClellan ? Because Mark McClellan ran Medicare in the Bush administration , and it’s people like the Simpson-Bowles Commission , the bipartisan fiscal commission said , `` The cost control in the Affordable Care Act will be affected , and we need if anything to double down on it . '' </s>
This is not my opinion , it’s not some crazy opinion , it is in fact the opinion of the best experts of left and right . </s>
Jonathan Cohn , your time is up . </s>
Thank you . Thank you very much . </s>
And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate , where the motion being argued is `` Repeal Obamacare . '' Now , keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening , because you’re going to be asked to vote again at the conclusion , and I want to remind you that the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner . So , now , on to round two where the debaters can address one another directly , and also take questions from me and you in the audience . </s>
I’m John Donvan of `` ABC News . '' We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . We have two teams of debaters , two against two , who are arguing over this motion , `` Repeal Obamacare . '' On one side , a former Congressman and former aide to John McCain are arguing that the plan passed by the Obama administration is going to blow up financially and will hurt America and is headed for the dust bin . Arguing against them , a former advisor to the Clinton administration and a journalist who has written extensively about healthcare , arguing that this act -- that this law should be preserved , and not only preserved , but built upon . </s>
I want to ask a question about philosophy . Both sides agree that the system we’ve lived with for the last 30 years , particularly in its last 15 or 20 years , is broken . You agree that something needs to be done . </s>
You 're arguing over the solutions . Your opposition on one side to the president’s program and you’re supporting the other side says what fundamentally about what you think we are as a nation , as Americans . I want to put that question first to you , John Shadegg , former congressman . I’m thrilled to have that question because I think it’s vitally important . I think we’re already -- we’re a nation that does support taking care of those who can’t care for themselves . </s>
We’re a nation -- and my legislation covers every single American -- we’re a nation that thinks it’s outrageous that anybody would lose coverage because there are pre-existing condition like my heart condition or my sister’s breast cancer . </s>
But we’re also a nation that honors limited government and honors individual choice . I think on the one hand what you hear from the other side is that the government can manage this issue better . And what I would suggest to you is we are in this problem because the government made changes that took you and I out of the equation . </s>
The government said health insurance is available only if your employer buys it and you get a tax deduction . </s>
But if you go out and buy it , it’s one-third more expensive . If you can’t hire and fire somebody’s who delivering a service to you , you can’t hold it accountable including its costs . John , you’re saying there’s an issue of individual freedom here Absolutely . The individual freedom is tied back to the cost of the service and because we can’t control it , you are controlling its cost . </s>
Let me take your response to the other side , Paul Starr who worked for the Clinton administration . I do think this is a question of our public philosophy and the obligations that we owe to one another . </s>
And it is , I think , a sad commentary on us that we remain the only advanced country that doesn’t provide protection to all of our citizens . Now the reason that we have -- let’s go back to why we have this employer-based system . If you don’t have government share , spread the costs of healthcare , there needs to be some organization that serves as the pool for risk . </s>
And the employer is the most convenient way to do it . That’s actually why this first developed in the 1930s and ‘40s before we had the tax advantages . It’s simply going to default from the government to employers . </s>
It’s not as though the government took this away from individuals . That individual market that the Congressman loves is phenomenally inefficient . But Paul , what about your opponents point that as a nation , philosophically as a nation , we’re defined by a commitment to limited government and that this program actually assaults that notion ? But it is a program , as I said before , that is trying to create a functioning market , a better functioning market than the one that currently exists . Those exchanges will give people choices that they don’t now have . </s>
All the Republicans are arguing is that you ought to give that choice to people . </s>
I do not favor individual purchase . That was the attack made against Senator McCain throughout the campaign and it was absolutely unfair . </s>
I favor a plan which says I as an individual can buy an individual plan , I can take my employer’s plan or I can buy from a whole group of expanded choices . We could have my social club . The Kiwanis Club can offer a plan . </s>
My university alumni can offer a plan . Give me that choice , force those insurance companies to compete . They don’t compete right now . They don’t care what you and I pay for health insurance and they don’t , quite frankly , care whether it treats us well . </s>
They only care that our employer bought the plan . </s>
Jonathan Cohn . Jonathan Cohn , arguing against repeal . Well , I would say I think all of us favor choice . Choice is a wonderful thing . </s>
We want to give choice . People who buy , I mean , we need to realize that the employer -- people who are getting private insurance are now divided into two groups . There are people who get it from their employers and there are people who buy it on their own . Neither of them has choices right now . You’re buying insurance on your own ? </s>
Good luck buying a coverage policy . You’re going to have trouble finding one , particularly if you have pre-existing conditions . </s>
You’ve got to shop across state lines . </s>
We’ll talk about that in a second . This Affordable Care Plan , what it does is it says , all right , let’s create a market , a real market , a place -- kind of like Expedia , like they have in Massachusetts now where everybody who’s buying one actually gets a choice of insurance programs , a set of plans that they know they can afford that will be made available to them regardless if they’re a cancer survivor and let all of those people shop . Meanwhile , employers who have insurance for their employees will continue to provide that . Look , at some point it is very easy to say we want to open up exchanges for everybody and let everybody shop . You can build on this system to do that . </s>
You can do that . But you’re never going to get to that system you’re talking about . You will never get to a system where people have choice and a choice of actual plans that are available to everybody , that cover what they need , until you build these exchanges that are in the affordable care act . </s>
Douglas Holtz-Eaken . You’re against the plan . </s>
I want to ask you , what -- what do you think the public actually wants ? </s>
I have no idea . </s>
Let me just -- I would never speak for 300 million Americans . And that 's one of the beautiful things about this country . And I think the -- you know , I agree , obviously , with a lot of what Jon has said . </s>
Go back to the beginning of the evening when we were asked to think about end of life care . </s>
Now , do you really think that Americans want an insurance company making decisions about the end of life care ? </s>
No . They 've already seen that model and rejected it -- </s>
So you are telling us what Americans want , or not . </s>
That you ca n't do that . They told us , I’ll read that evidence . </s>
I do n't think they want the government making those decisions . I think we know who makes those decisions . </s>
It 's the family . </s>
It 's -- those are the only people who are ethically well situated to make those tough calls . And so we must , in the end , invest in families , the authority to make decisions , invest in them , their insurance . Invest in them the information and the ability to make those decisions and center this system around families and Americans , not around these large government entities . What does that mean in practice ? I 'm an economist . </s>
I mean , economists are practical people . You follow your nose and incentives . If I have an insurance policy when I 'm 21 , and then I develop an odd thing where I have to have my kidneys transplanted , I 'm still on that insurance policy . Any insurance company now has to recognize they 've got me for life . </s>
It 's not a one-year sign-up proposition where they can minimize on preventive care or they can try to cut off covering some things . They have to deal with the right lifetime incentives . </s>
Pay for the cheap prevention up front . A lot of them eventually want to do that . And align the insurance and the medical incentives to transform the way we deliver medicine in America . </s>
That 's what we need . And in the process , guess what ? </s>
My insurance goes with me from job to job , job to home when I stayed home with my kids . You do n't have to spend the whole time fighting over who works full time to get the insurance . It 's madness . </s>
Americans are rearranging their lives for the insurance . Let 's rearrange the insurance so it fits American lives . That 's what this system will be . </s>
Jonathan Cohn , you said in your opening remarks -- Jonathan Cohn , you have said that the Obama plan took the best from both left and right . Give me one idea from the right that your opponents will recognize as an idea that is from their side , that they just love . </s>
Sure , absolutely . Well , first of all , to start , there 's a pilot program funding for malpractice reform . </s>
You know , believe it or not , people who wrote the Affordable Care Act , and I would include myself among this , actually believe that there is some money to be saved by reforming the malpractice system . So there 's money out there for -- </s>
Let me just take that to this side . </s>
Do you recognize that as one of your ideas ? Can I just say the big problem -- Douglas Holtz-Eakin . I will stipulate late one thing I want to get very clear on the table . I support exchanges . </s>
I support -- I always support good competitive markets . And you can build exchanges that enhance competition left to do that . There is a lot in the bill that is bipartisan . </s>
It 's in the delivery system reforms , not in the coverage expansions which are madness . But they 're all tiny . </s>
They 're pilots . Pilots have a terrible track record of actually turning into real policy . In fact the road to healthcare hell is paved with pilots and demonstrations . And that 's a pilot and a demonstration for a known problem . </s>
If you 've got a problem , fix it . The problem with this bill , it does n't fix what we know is the issue , healthcare costs . Instead , it 's got a bunch of pilots that Congress will never actually implement . And it does n't fix the biggest source of our problem , which is the Medicare system which pays for fragmentation , pays for overuse . It 's a fee for service system . </s>
We have more problems created by those programs than this could ever solve . So what 's the point of the program . I have to respond to this because really , you know , that 's amazing for you to say about the Medicare program . We had legislation under the Republicans to reform Medicare , to introduce private insurance plans into Medicare . </s>
And what is the result ? </s>
We now know that those plans cost Medicare an extra $ 1,000 per beneficiary compared to what it would have cost Medicare just to deal with them in a traditional program . So . -- this is a very important point . John . </s>
You want to share some time with your -- No . I 'd like to -- -- 30 seconds of getting facts straight . The problem is the healthcare bill . </s>
Medicare Advantage is one way to shift it from one person to another . Tax policy , which he said would save us money , does n't . It just shifts the bill around from one person to another . The problem is the bill . </s>
This law does not change our healthcare bill . That 's its issue . </s>
Can I just say -- Jonathan Cohn . With all due -- did you read the bill ? I mean , I -- is . And did you read the -- I know you 've cited CBO reports . </s>
There are page -- I mean , we all know it 's a thousand-page bill . Let me tell you -- No , no , it 's not a thousand page bill . It 's $ 2800 . </s>
2800 pages . Okay . </s>
Well , the type 's very big . That 's how they do congressional -- There you go . Okay . </s>
Whatever . You know , I think if you condense it -- true story , if you condense it , it actually comes down to about 300 pages , which you know , is less than a John Grisham book so take that into account . But not nearly as good , right ? Not nearly as good . I 'm actually not a John Grisham fan . </s>
But your mileage may vary . But I mean there are -- and you yourself admitted the delivery reforms in there -- you think they 're not big enough , okay ? And you know what ? I would agree with you . I would like those delivery reforms to be stronger . </s>
So here is a proposition . You 're talking about repealing Obamacare . Yes . How about let 's reinforce it . </s>
Let 's make those bigger . Why do you want to go back and start from scratch ? John Shadegg . </s>
I have to raise an issue which your side has raised , and that is you say it gives people choices . It takes a lot of gall to say that it gives people choices . For example , in Medicare Advantage , it repeals Medicare Advantage for millions of Americans and takes them off . It reduces subsidies that are . </s>
No , no . It takes -- it will drive people off of Medicare Advantage . Every expert agrees on that . </s>
Two , you say that people will have choice of plans . </s>
There is one plan prescribed by the government , actually has three different components , but that 's it . Three . Secretary Sebelius can grant exemptions . She already has too many companies . </s>
She has the ability to impose new benefit mandates . She has ability to say what premium increase is effective or not effective . The notion that this bill gives the average American more choice is ridiculous . It 's going to take away the choices Americans have now , and it 's going to force them into essentially a one-size-fits-all plan . When you say , for example , to employers , that your costs are going to up , such as AT & T , to the tune where you could pay the fine for not insuring every one of your employees and still save $ 2 billion , they 're going to have no choice but to drop their coverage and put people into the government- run plan . </s>
Can I just respond to this because this is the second time that you 've mentioned this . Let me finish . Let me finish . </s>
Let him finish , Paul , because I do want to hear the response to this . John Shadegg . </s>
If AT & T or any of these other companies wanted to drop coverage now -- Hold on just one minute . And you get 15 more seconds to finish your point . </s>
Sit this thing down . </s>
No , he can go . That 's fine . Oh , I give you 15 seconds , and you throw it away . </s>
I mean -- Okay . </s>
Paul . Under current law , if any of those companies wanted to drop coverage , they could do it legally . This law introduces a penalty for dropping coverage . So how can you say that the law encourages them to -- </s>
Precisely because right now they choose to provide that coverage for their employees because that competitive market requires them to do that . People want good coverage . If they drop that coverage , there 's no place for those employees to go . </s>
Under this bill , they will all get government subsidies . And oh , by the way , AT & T can take that $ 2 billion savings and add it to people 's salaries . So the notion that this is going to give you more choice , when , for example , we do n't allow interstate competition in health insurance now . </s>
Your employer makes the choice of your plan . You ca n't hire -- Okay . </s>
You ca n't fire . </s>
Jonathan -- Jonathan -- I want you to have -- </s>
It 's actually quite cogently put . And you know , it makes sense . </s>
And then , gosh , why would AT & T keep providing coverage ? </s>
If you 're right , and I know Doug has written a paper on this also , if you guys are right , that in offering all of these subsidies companies are going to drop , then we should see that in Massachusetts right now because that 's what they have in Massachusetts . They offer the subsidies , and companies -- but you know what ? It has n't happened . Employer-sponsored insurance in Massachusetts -- </s>
No , no , no , no . Let me ... It has n't happened . And the best estimates from the experts are that it wo n't happen . </s>
And there 's a very complicated -- I mean , I could go through all the math -- I read Doug 's paper on this , and I know it seems like it makes sense , but it does n't happen . Would it happen right now with Medicaid ? </s>
And you know , you do n't see company -- half the people who qualify for Medicaid -- Let 's let your Massachusetts . Respond to that . Actually , number one , in Massachusetts , we 're down to , I think , to only four carriers . </s>
Several of them are in dire straits . Many of them have demanded from the governor that he allow them to raise rates . </s>
The governor has said no . And some of them -- -- are on the verge of folding . Now , let me ask you something . </s>
The plan , under Obamacare , says that if you 're in an exchange , a government-run exchange , and you only offer the policy that the government exchange allows , then you can get a subsidy . Every Republican plan says let 's give every single American a tax refund , a tax credit to go buy the plan of their choice . Now , I guarantee you , if we do that , so we say to every American , you get a refundable tax credit , a refund , and for the poor , it 's cash , to go buy the plan of your choice . And you can buy your employer 's plan . </s>
You can buy in the individual market . You can join a new group sponsored by the Kiwanis club . </s>
You can join a new group sponsored by -- Would you mandate a purchase ? </s>
Would you mandate it ? No , I would not mandate it because I think freedom is a hallmark of this country . And I think if we offer great -- So maybe a lot of that money would end up at the amusement park or the race track ? Well , let me tell you how my plan works . </s>
It offers every single American , every single American that refundable tax credit if they do n't make enough money if they do not enroll because they are homeless and do n't get the notice we automatically enroll them because we know their Social Security number and we knew it as one point , they show up for care somewhere , and they say , `` What plan did you enroll in ? '' And the individual says -- she 's a mother of three that was moving from Idaho to Arizona on the day that the notice came to her , she says , `` I did n't enroll . '' </s>
They look her up on a Social Security number and they say , `` Oh , yeah , you 're in the pool . '' Okay . </s>
`` And you 're covered . '' That 's the way Paul Ryan 's bill works , that 's the way Tom Coburn 's -- Okay , John , you 've made that point . I want to stay on the merits of the Obama plan . </s>
Do you want to respond to that , either of you , gentlemen ? I want to respond to this whole notion that it 's a complete individual free market here , to talk a little bit about the way insurance works . </s>
Healthcare is very different from other kinds of services and commodities . Seventy percent of the healthcare costs in any year are concentrated in 10 percent of the people . So insurance companies have a very strong incentive to cherry pick , to go out and to look for the 50 percent of people who actually account for only three percent of the costs . And when you have this market where supposedly everybody has individual choices , you also have a market where the insurance companies are going to cherry pick and avoid the sick people . They will do everything in their -- it is the best business model for them . </s>
Rather than try to control healthcare costs , it 's just to avoid sick people . The way the exchanges work is that if you want to sell insurance in the exchange , you have to agree to take anybody . That’s the bargain . And what the exchange does , so the people pay in on a community rated basis , but the insurance companies get paid according to the risk of the population they enroll . </s>
So if they enroll an older population , if they enroll a sicker population , they get paid more . That’s what goes on through the exchange that won’t go on through this market . </s>
I realize this is complicated . Insurance is a complicated business , and this law is trying to take account of the way this business characteristically malfunctions . </s>
That’s why we end up with millions of people uninsured . Okay , I’m going to come to questions and -- I’m going to come to questions from you in just a minute . I want to give this side one 35- second shot at -- </s>
So John Shadegg is taking . </s>
This criticism is often made , and the Democrat answer , the Obamacare answer is to say , “Okay , we’re going to do guaranteed issue , everybody gets insurance even if you 're already sick . '' The incentive of that is not to buy insurance until it’s too late or until the costs have gone up . </s>
I’d like to ask Paul , “How is it the insurance companies know who’s going to get sick before the people know , and how is it that they can cherry pick the healthy ? ” But let me tell you how Republicans solve this problem . </s>
Let me tell you how Republicans would solve this problem , I know because I happen to have written it , what you do is you say to everyone that has a preexisting condition or has a chronic illness , `` You have the right , the absolute right to join what’s called a high risk pool . </s>
You may enroll in that plan if you are either denied coverage altogether or if your coverage is priced at , we’ll say , 20 percent , or 30 percent , or more above the average cost , because you have a preexisting condition . </s>
Once you enroll in the high risk pool , your health is covered comprehensively including my sister 's breast cancer or my heart condition , and the -- so that means that the cost of insuring that pool is higher than the cost of insuring any other pool . That’s a high risk pool . The costs of insuring that group are then subsidized either by dividing it equally , the extra costs amongst every insurance company in the jurisdiction , it could be the state or it could be federal , or by general revenues from the state , often done by sin taxes . I happen to know that because it’s already the law in 22 different states . All right . </s>
I happen to know it because I wrote the last federal law that allows it . John , John , let me move on to some questions from the audience . And if you -- what I’d like to ask you to do , I’ll call on you , wait till a microphone reaches you , and then hold the microphone about one fist 's distance from your mouth so that the television and radio can hear you very clearly . And there’s a gentleman in a black sweater . </s>
Hey , sir , before you begin , I just want to ask you something , what have you heard so far that you thought , `` Well , I hadn’t thought of that before '' ? Hmm . That 's a tough question . I thought I was asking the question . Guess we have n't -- Your turn will come . </s>
And I’ll give you a pass if you don’t have a ready answer to that . And I 'm not meaning to put you on the spot , I’m actually quite curious to know how it’s being received out there . So if you have no thoughts on that , we will pretend that question didn’t come up . My only thought is , next time I will not be the first questioner . </s>
Go ahead . My question is for the gentleman on this side . Recently my house burned down and I tried to buy fire insurance after the fact and the insurance company said it was a pre- existing fire . Now , that doesn’t sound fair to me . </s>
Does it sound fair to you ? No , no it’s not . That is why -- So I should be able to buy fire insurance after my house burns down . </s>
No , no absolutely not . </s>
Look , one of the reasons that there is a mandate in this law is precisely to avoid the possibility that people will refuse to buy insurance until they get sick . </s>
That’s the whole rationale for the mandate . </s>
Now I’ve actually proposed another way to accomplish the same purpose because the mandate is the single most unpopular part of the bill . People don’t understand that the mandate is directly related to the elimination of pre-existing condition exclusion . You can’t eliminate those exclusions just for the reasons you said unless you have some way to get the people into the pool . </s>
My alternative is the following . If you want to opt out , if you don’t want to be part of the system , okay , you can do that without penalty . But you have to sign a form saying “I won’t come back and I can not come back in . For five years , I can’t use the exchanges , I can’t get the subsidies , I can’t get a policy without the pre-existing conditions.” </s>
So I understand your position completely . We need to be able to avoid the possibility that people will behave opportunistically . </s>
So Paul , you don’t want to repeal but you do want to tinker . </s>
Oh , I am willing to make changes . Tinkering’s fine . We’re not against it . </s>
Everybody who understands this plan thinks it’s not a perfect bill . No bill is perfect . The question is is it a good foundation . </s>
Let me do a very quick thing for radio . This is a U.S. debate -- This is a great debate . I just wanted to say that . </s>
I’m John Donvan of ABC News . This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University , New York and hundreds of NPR stations across the nation . </s>
Our motion is “Repeal Obamacare” and we are taking questions from the audience . How was that ? Not bad . Very good . Woman with your hand up right there . </s>
Yep . I’m going to ask you the same question and if you’re not prepared to answer that’s fine , I just want to -- what are you hearing that has caught your ear ? What I’m hearing is that the Republicans have a plan . I’ve never heard of any Republican plan in all the years that Republicans were in control . Okay , your question . </s>
Maybe that was it . </s>
That was it . </s>
Oh , that was a comment . </s>
Okay . </s>
Well , there you go . </s>
On the side , gentleman , yes , right there . Thanks . If you could stand . </s>
Also if you happen to be a member of the news media , we would appreciate it if you could identify yourself as such . </s>
I’m from the state of Massachusetts , actually . My question is not about that . I’m the son of a surgeon and I’m wondering if the bill does anything to address the so-called doctor fix with regards to Medicare pay outs to doctors ? That comes up in Congress pretty frequently . </s>
I was wondering -- Fourteen seconds on what that means for people who don’t know what that is . To my knowledge , I’m not an expert on it . </s>
I just hear my father rant and rave about it . The -- I believe it was in the cost bills back in the ‘90s to try to reform Medicare , they had a formula to try to pay doctors at some rate pegged to inflation and it doesn’t work . </s>
I’m not an expert on it myself . </s>
But I know it comes up in Congress quite frequently . It causes a stir . </s>
I think it somehow drives pay outs to doctors who see Medicare patients . Down 40 or 50 percent every six months . I know it comes up in Congress pretty frequently . I -- </s>
Okay . If you don’t mind , I’m going to pass on the question unless it’s quite relevant . </s>
-- on this broken formula that reimburses doctors under Medicare , part of the BBA that Jonathan lauded which in the end failed miserably . The bottom line is it’s not part of the bill because they left it out . </s>
It’s part of the cost they don’t want to acknowledge . If you want to know why this doesn’t reduce the deficit , they left out $ 300 billion worth of costs . </s>
And the CBO doesn’t have the option of saying hey , you left that out . </s>
They have the obligation to price only what is in there . Jonathan Cohn . And they are precluded by law from raising their hand and saying but you left out the doctors . </s>
Jonathan Cohn . I ran the CBO . </s>
Here’s something else . You look at the CBO report on the Affordable Care Act and you’ll discover something shocking . It doesn’t account for the cost of the war in Afghanistan . </s>
Now that’s because the war in Afghanistan is a separate piece of legislation . During the late 1990’s , as part of a much larger balanced budget bill that I recall quite correctly working and getting us balanced budgets for a while -- You’ve given back all those savings . You’ve given them all back . They don’t work . </s>
Before the— tax cut , I remember , I was against it . </s>
-- has nothing to do with tax cuts . Nothing to do with tax cuts ? Nothing to do with tax cuts ? Really . </s>
The BBA health provisions have -- </s>
Wait , wait , wait . You 're really saying the Bush tax cuts have nothing to do with the deficits ? </s>
No . It has nothing to do with healthcare . </s>
I agree . So this is -- You 're making my point . This is a debate about healthcare . And the fact of the matter is the balanced budget agreement healthcare provisions passed in the late '90s failed . </s>
They did not control costs . </s>
And in the end , the Congress had to give the money back , as they will have to give it to the physicians under Medicare . That -- Jonathan , 20 seconds . -- did not work . Okay . </s>
You 're hearing a very interesting version of the history of the '90s and healthcare . The doctor fix was built into our budgets for the government long before healthcare reform came on the scene . It is something that needs to be fixed separately . </s>
It would have to be fixed separately if we never had Obamacare . It is a separate cost . </s>
Who can tell me in 15 seconds what it is , because I do n't know . It is literally this . It was a formula for reimbursements for doctors . Doctors are very expensive . </s>
And so they keep pretending they 're not going to fulfill the formula . And then doctors face a big pay cut . And then Congress says , “Well , I guess we do have to pay doctors . </s>
Doctors are part of healthcare.” They are part of healthcare . </s>
Part of healthcare reform . So your dad is afraid he 's going to be paid less , but he is n't -- Twenty five percent less next year unless they , once again , put the money back in . Another question , please . From the far side with the gray hair . </s>
I found it interesting that the panel is assuming that healthcare runs on a perfect market economy , which is fundamentally flawed . </s>
I wanted to know about , you keep addressing costs . And I think that this debate is mostly about access to care and not really about costs . Do either of you have an answer to utilization and patient and physician-induced demand , which is really the cost -- So is the bill designed to get people insured , or is it designed to keep the costs down primarily ? Paul Starr . </s>
But nobody 's addressed cost , which is utilization . Well , it 's both of those things . But the questioner used a phrase which probably went by a lot of people . He talked about physician-induced demand or provider-induced demand . So this is another aspect of how healthcare is different . </s>
Normally , when you are the customer , you make decisions about what to buy . But when you 're a patient , particularly when you 're very sick , you 're in the hospital , other people are making decisions . </s>
They 're prescribing drugs , procedures and so forth . And if you 're really sick , and most of the big costs are generated for people who are very ill , it 's not -- the demand is n't coming from you . It 's coming from the supplier . This is a very bizarre system . a very interesting point . </s>
I want to hear -- and that 's one of Paul Starr 's basic arguments for why this is not like other things that you pay money for . Can you respond to that , John -- Douglas Holtz-Eakin . Couple responses . Number one , there are no perfect markets . And to somehow compare health markets against perfection misses the point . </s>
All markets are , at some level , imperfect and have anomalies of the same type . The solution to this is to better inform -- hang on . Let me finish . Let me finish . The important thing here is to have reforms which Republicans include as well as the -- your arguments , to better inform patients so they can distinguish between valuable and invaluable treatments . </s>
And we have a system riddled with low-value care . </s>
And all of the reforms Republicans propose address that issue . An important thing to recognize , the reason I 'm deeply opposed to this bill is , it is fundamentally -- there are pages attached to all the issues . </s>
But it is fundamentally a coverage bill . And if you look at half the expansions , they are in Medicaid . Sixteen million Americans we 've put into Medicaid . Medicaid 's a terrible system . Fifty percent of providers will not see Medicaid patients . </s>
Medicaid patients are twice as likely to show up at the ER for regular medical care than are the uninsured . </s>
And it is a great joke to give someone an insurance policy called Medicaid and not let them actually see a physician . John Shadegg , you want to add to that briefly ? I do . To what your partner said . </s>
In a New Republic article that came out some time ago , I 'm sorry , the New York Times -- New York -- </s>
One of those . -- article . New Yorker magazine was the article . It documented -- John , start that again for the editing later on . </s>
You 're taking out our -- </s>
For radio . In a recent authoritative article which appeared in the New Yorker , they studied where healthcare costs are the highest . And interestingly , they found that the highest place for healthcare costs in America is a little town called McAllen , Texas . </s>
And they went to McAllen , Texas , and tried to find out why are costs so high . And what they found was a couple of different factors . Number one , they found that doctors in fact do prescribe lots of procedures that are unnecessary . And they do so in McAllen , Texas . They noted that , for example , great healthcare centers do not prescribe that many procedures . </s>
And so they figured out there needed to be a way . </s>
They actually began interviewing doctors . And they said , you know what ? In the current system , we are not incentivized to control costs . Why are they not incentivized to control costs ? Because nobody 's watching the store . </s>
The reality is -- But you’re agreeing with that sort of monitoring . As Paul said , if the consumer is n't paying the bill , then nobody 's watching . Yeah , yeah . And in this circumstance , yeah , if you 're sick , you 're not making the decision . </s>
But right now , your family could be making that decision . But right now under the current system and under Obamacare , you will not be making that cost decision because you 're cut out of the process . So I 'm having this very disoriented feeling listening to a lot of this because you 're stealing some of my talking points here . Maybe -- I love to do that . </s>
But , no , I agree . </s>
That article was very influential . Actually President Obama was known to have read it . He did . He handed it around to his staff . </s>
And I think most people who study the healthcare system agree that , you know , one of the weird things about our healthcare system is you have these bizarre regional variations . So you go to some parts of the country , and they 're doing all kinds of extra procedures , and other parts of the country , they 're not . And why is that ? Well , the people who wrote this bill , they all read that article . </s>
They all know this . </s>
And the article actually built on years and years of studies showing that and it’s very specifically designed to help address that problem . And there 're all kinds of ways it does . </s>
I mean , it would be -- I would love to be able to sit here and say , here is the silver bullet that will change it . Because that 's what he thinks . </s>
“Oh , you know , if we just give everyone choice , you know , if we give everyone the consumer power it will somehow sort this all out.” Well , good luck with that . I mean , I do n't know about you . </s>
But the last time my kid was sick , it took me three hours on WebMD to figure out even what the symptoms were . Did you -- do you just not like what you 're hearing , or did you have a question to follow ? </s>
40 percent of all healthcare costs , so -- Okay . I 'm going to pass on to another question . This gentleman right in the center . You 've been very patient . </s>
Here . I 'd sort of like to get to the heart of the cost things because I think there 's a little bit of denial going on . An early mentor said to me if the financial analysis defies common sense , go with common sense . So now we get 35 million new people coming into Medicaid . We 've got baby boomers retiring in droves going into the Medicare program . </s>
And we 've got all that intercepting with all advancements in care and treatments , procedures and drugs which extend life and make life more livable . </s>
And a big underpinning , a big way that the Obama bill is going to get this under control is by slowing the cost of Medicare and Medicaid . I believe the number is about -- So can you focus to a question . Pardon me ? </s>
Can you focus to a question , having studied your premise . Well , yeah , yeah , yeah . Here 's what I think is going to happen . I want you to tell me it 's not . Yeah . </s>
That will result -- there 's a videotape of every president since Richard Nixon saying they 're going to solve this problem by getting waste and fraud out of the system . I think it 's going to reduce reimbursements . </s>
And I think that 's going to drive more and more of the better docs out of the system . It 's already happening . </s>
Where I live in Sarasota , Florida -- I need a question , please . Tell me why that 's not going to happen and why it 's not going to hurt the people at the bottom of our economic scale . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Jonathan Cohn , who is against repeal . Very quickly on this question about physician -- and what you 're -- if I understand what you 're saying , your last question there is about if we 're going to spend less on Medicare , if Medicare is going to pay less , then why wo n't doctors just leave the system ? Well , we 've done reductions in Medicare like this before . We 've done reductions larger than the ones we 've done before . </s>
And by the way , during the McCain campaign , Mr. Holtz- Eakin , I remember , very vividly , saying that they were going to pay for their healthcare plan by enacting Medicare cuts that were even larger . Now , I do n't think he was trying to deprive Medicare patients of access . But the fact is we 've had these cuts before . And every time it happens , you hear a lot of predictions , oh , my God , people are going to stop seeing Medicare patients . </s>
And I understand that . </s>
Look , my father is a surgeon . He 's in south Florida where you see people walking around with little dollar signs because there are cataract surgeries and , you know , that 's what it 's like . And I understand that . The fact is , every single time that we have done this , there have been predictions that doctors are going to flee the system . And you 'll always get the anecdotal , of course , this doctor is leaving that -- but the Medicare payment advisory committee looks at this . </s>
There 's a government , independent , not partisan authority that looks at these statistics to monitor this , because they want to make sure that 's not happening . </s>
There 's a group called the Center for the Study of Healthcare System Change , which is the longest acronym ever for a think tank . But believe me , they 're very reliable , totally nonpartisan . Everyone trusts -- And what they all found is it never happens . </s>
The doctors have not left the system . Douglas Holtz-Eakin . Douglas Holtz-Eakin . </s>
I want to , first , stipulate late , that the place they send old CBO directors to die is the Medicare payment advisory commission . I 've been there . And prospectively , the MedPAC as well as the CMS actuary would say that the kinds of cuts and vision for Medicare will either lead to inadequate care , inability to see providers , or you can go put the money back in . So there are no real changes in the business model that would allow a physician to practice more cheaply in Medicare , and that is why we should have fixed the problem instead of written the checks that is this system . I think that is the fundamental indictment , we are not fixing the problem , and it is important to recognize that although there 's all these bells and whistles that Jonathan likes to point to , there are lots of pages , they do n't have any teeth . </s>
They put something in called the `` Independent Payment Advisory Board , '' that 's like MedPAC on steroids , and -- but the law says they ca n't make beneficiaries pay more , they ca n't touch the hospitals and the nursing homes for 10 years , they ca n't mess with the way the docs get paid , so where 's the big change in the way the delivery system 's going to happen ? Let 's go to the audience for more questions . Ma'am . Yes . </s>
Can you stand , please ? Hi . And just give a second for the camera to find you . Yes . I am retired psychiatric social worker , and I have n't really heard much about the pain and suffering , it 's cost , cost , and I know money 's an issue , but I have n't heard the human side of this at all , and it 's very dismaying . </s>
The other thing is , what about the issue of Americans are not taking very good care of themselves and they say 75 percent of the health issues of course are people 's bad habits , or a lot of them . But do you think that 's about a law ? </s>
Well , no , but , I mean , but a law , I mean , I think one of the things Obamacare wanted to do was try to get people to take care of themselves better and reward , you know , doctors who concentrate on prevention , and change of habits , and diet , and exercise . And that’s a very important -- Paul Starr , is there any traction in that argument ? And I’ll come back to you , John . </s>
Well , there are a number of measures in the bill that promote preventive services but -- and they are very important . Medicare beneficiaries will get preventive services that have never been covered before . </s>
Those are some of the terrible mandates for private insurance that’s going to have to cover vaccinations , things like that . But , you know , I’m not counting on that for big savings . I don’t think the government really can change personal behavior in that profound a way , and I -- personally , actually , I don’t want to change that . I bet , John Shadegg , you agree with that point ? I don’t think government can change personal behavior , but I think law can change personal behavior because right now this system does not incentivize you or I to take care of ourselves . </s>
There are companies that have looked at this . Safeway , for example , has said , “You know what ? Having obese employees , having employees with out of control blood pressure , having employees with severe cholesterol is a severe problem , '' and so they’ve gone in and they have -- </s>
John , you’re talking about the system that existed prior to the reform , or you’re talking about the reform plan does not address these issues ? The reform plan says government’s going to do it . What I’m saying is you have to incentivize people to do it , and the way you can incentivize people to do it is to give them skin in the game . Actually , Safeway cuts the cost of its employees’ healthcare if they lower their blood pressure , or if they consistently take their cholesterol medicine . </s>
We can’t -- May I just say so does the Walt Disney Company , of which I am an employee . There you go . </s>
I take the human side of this argument very , very seriously . </s>
When we were kids growing up , our parents bought indemnity plans , and the doctors cared about us because there was a physician-patient relationship . We put the cash on their table . The system we have created now divorces us completely from our doctor . It says your doctor isn’t hired by you , your doctor is hired by a plan who was hired by your employer . </s>
And that is what has caused medicine to -- caused damage to the physician-patient relationship , it’s caused a loss of control in costs , and it has caused the kind of devastation that you’re talking about . I know people that can’t afford care because the insurance companies don’t give a damn about what it cares . </s>
It’s time to stop shoveling money to them and put the power and control in your hands , not to give it to the government so Secretary Sebelius could write a thousand new regulations . </s>
That’s not going to make it more personal , and then the plan I propose covers every single American , every one . I think you agree with most of that . Do I agree that I -- I think that people sometimes are at the mercy of their insurance company ? Absolutely , and that is why I support this bill and don’t think we should repeal it . </s>
I mean , remember right now your insurance company says you can’t get that treatment , you’re stuck . Right now you’re moving between insurance companies -- You know , you 're -- right now you 're moving between insurance company and insurance company , you change plans and tomorrow you have to change doctors because they’re not in the same network . </s>
This plan allows people to stay on the same insurance plan longer and when that denial comes down , guess what ? You can appeal it . </s>
What a notion . You can actually go to an impartial person and say “You know what ? </s>
They’re saying I can’t get this premium because they think it’s too expensive . </s>
I think I have the medical evidence that it works , ” and the board says , “You know what ? You’re right.” </s>
That’s a mandate . </s>
That’s a regulation , and you know what ? </s>
It helps people . </s>
Yeah . You just raised your right hand . </s>
Will you stand up and the mic will come to you , thanks . Can I ask you what you’re hearing so far that in any way changed your mind ? </s>
It hasn’t changed my mind . It’s been a lot of the same rhetoric I think . But I keep hearing always the proponents of repealing the law about consumer choice and way before this law they kept talking about consumer choice will lower costs . And I want to ask you if you really believe that a parent with a child that needs heart surgery is going to choose the cheapest heart surgeon and the cheapest hospital . And when your father’s dying of prostate cancer they’re going to choose to not give four months of very expensive treatment and thus lower cost . </s>
That’s a question for the side arguing for repeal . I’m going to give you a bad answer and I will hand it over to Mr. Shadegg . </s>
This is what I would say to you . Healthcare is not a one thing . It’s not just the circumstances tragic and threatening as you described . Healthcare and where we spend this is an enormous range that involves elective procedures , it involves chronic conditions , it involves traumatic injury and we have a system that does not provide individuals with anything like the ability to manage their care , anything like information needed to choose from high and low value care and never gets them in a preventive way in a position to avoid being stuck with a tragic choice . </s>
That’s wrong . We need a system that they control all aspects of their life cycle up to those very moments . And I have a great faith in the ability of the American people . They do it in every other aspect of their lives some of which are enormous , they have kids . That’s a pretty life and death situation . </s>
Paul Starr who is against repeal . I have great faith in the ability to do it . </s>
Paul Starr who is against repeal . </s>
Well , I agree with the sympathies of the questioner that there’s something really fundamentally amiss here , this image of the patient as economic man . How really out of touch it is with the conditions of illness . How , in fact , it assumes a kind of marketplace where , for example , prices would be available . Actually , you can’t find out what the prices are for different things . </s>
And in fact a hospital has 12 different prices for the same thing depending on who it’s treating . We don’t have a system of posted prices in healthcare . Now , maybe you want to change all that . Maybe you want to transform it but you were in power for years and you didn’t do anything about it . John Shadegg . </s>
Yeah . The decision point that you referred to , once they’ve gotten sick , is not the right one . The reality is people are economic beings and they do make economic decisions . Indeed , I proposed a bill in the United States Congress that would allow you if you live in New Jersey to buy a plan that was written and offered for sale in Arizona or Idaho or Illinois or Connecticut . No , no . </s>
Let me explain how it works . You could buy that policy -- and the reason I wrote that bill is because the people in New Jersey today pay at least four times more than the people in Pennsylvania because of those strictures of the law in New Jersey . Indeed , Americans who go to New Jersey are going to their friends that live in Pennsylvania and say , “What are you paying ? And they’re saying “Well , I’m paying one-fourth of what you’re paying.” And people are actually buying health insurance by pretending they live in Pennsylvania when they really live in New Jersey because it costs one-fourth as much . </s>
Now we heard the argument that nobody would shop but people really do shop . </s>
But here’s why shopping -- ah -- if they can shop -- what makes me maddest about all of this- - To quote you , you’re saying from the audience , cheaper premiums do not mean cheaper healthcare . John , respond to that . The ability , for example , to buy across lines . </s>
People are not going to pay , are not going to choose to pay cheaper premiums unless they have to . What they’re going to do is pay , they’re going to spend as much as they can on healthcare and get the best product they can . </s>
They won’t choose to buy a cheap policy , some may , but most people buy the most expensive policy they can . In fact , that was a study done on my bill allowing across state line health insurance sales and indeed , no less than the Department of Health and Human Services said if you simply allowed cross state sales of health insurance we would have eight million fewer people uninsured in America today . </s>
Now , here 's the point . It 's not -- the key is n't that you will be able to get a cheaper policy . The problem is the insurance companies are cheating us right now . They 're charging too much because they do n't have to compete . </s>
Okay -- The reality is -- </s>
On the far right . You 're standing in the aisle and making yourself known . Thank you . Hi . I know we 're here to discuss to repeal or not to repeal . </s>
But that is not the question . I think the central question should be -- and it is also my question to you , what is our path to a truly universal , affordable healthcare system ? Because whether we have the Affordable Care Act or whether we have the status quo , both systems are asking us to put our faith in the private health insurance industry which is profit driven . And life and death matters should not be decided by the profit motive . </s>
So that what is the path -- What is the path to an improved Medicare system open to all ? Repealing Obamacare is the question . But given your passion and verve , I 'd just like to give each side 30 seconds each to respond to that . And either of you can take it from there . </s>
This law reflects a conviction that we can regulate a private system , not just private insurers , but also private hospitals , private doctors , and achieve the goals that you 're interested in , a universal system . And in fact , really , if you look at other countries , they 're not all government controlled . </s>
They have many private insurance funds in many European countries and achieve a universal -- </s>
Thank you . On this side . </s>
Douglas Holtz-Eakin . There 's nothing about insurance companies , per se , that anyone should like . </s>
But the alternative , a monopoly that you have to deal with , is completely inferior to having a vibrant insurance industry that has to compete for your business . I would much rather force them to give me a decent service than have a mandate that I have to use the one that 's supplied by the government . </s>
The second thing is , remember , for those advocates of a single big national payer , a national payer can not negotiate any better between one hospital in Wichita and another hospital in Wichita which is ultimately where you have to negotiate who can provide this care at the cheapest price . </s>
They ca n't do it any better than the guy in Wichita . </s>
So there is literally no advantage to a national plan . It 's a charade . John Shadegg , your partner . Your goal is my -- </s>
All right . Debaters are here on this one . John Shadegg , very quickly . Your goal is my goal . Long ago , I embraced universal coverage . </s>
One point we have n't talked about tonight very much is how many people are going to lose the coverage they have . You said how do we get to that right healthcare system . </s>
I 'll tell you how . Number one , allow the people that like their plan to keep their plan . Number two , deal with the issue of the uninsured by giving them a refundable tax credit . </s>
Give them cash -- </s>
John , you 've made this point before so I 'm going to -- in the interest of time , I 'm going to move on . One more question . And , ma'am , purple scarf , yeah . My question is , why should we not trust our elected officials ? </s>
Why , if people have their lives in public service -- well , I mean , you were voted into office . Why should we not ? </s>
I lived in Great Britain for 25 years . I was a beneficiary of the National Health Service as well as private medicine . But there was an implicit trust that my tax pounds from my paycheck would help subsidize healthcare . Okay . </s>
But I trusted that they would , regardless of whether they were labor or conservative . And same in this country , Republican , Democrats , we 're all -- So your question is why be so suspicious and skeptical of the ability of the bureaucracy to do the job well . I want to put that -- </s>
Bureaucracy -- people who have devoted their lives to public service who are elected officials , because some Americans -- The elected officials . Let 's put that to the side that 's arguing to repeal . John Shadegg . </s>
I think we should trust them . However , in this instance , we did n't . And point of fact , when Obamacare passed , it was opposed by roughly 54 percent of the American people . Each day it 's opposed by somewhere closer to 60 percent of the people . There is no poll out there yet that says that it 's favored by more people than not . </s>
But more importantly than that -- and this is a key point -- when a nation that is a democracy makes a radical change in public policy , it should be reflected not by the narrowest of consensus but by a very broad consensus . When Social Security was adopted , more than 80 percent of the members of the Congress , House and Senate , voted for the creation of Social Security . When Medicare and Medicare were created , more than 70 percent of the members of Congress supported those programs . When SCHIP was adopted , again , the numbers were well over 75 percent of the members of Congress . </s>
Okay . When this bill passed , it passed by the slimmest of margins . </s>
In the House , 50.8 percent , purely partisan vote . And without the kind of consensus that I think will make it sustainable . </s>
Jonathan Cohn . If it were sustainable , we would n't be having this debate . </s>
Jonathan Cohn , 30 seconds . Okay . </s>
Very quickly , the polls -- if you scratch those polls even a little bit , what you will find is that it 's a country overall . Do you like the healthcare reform ? Yes , no , about divided . Ask the people who do n't like it , do you think it should be repealed and just we should go back to the way we were , or make it stronger ? </s>
About half the people break off , say , “Oh , no , we want it to be stronger.” And if you test the individual elements , they 're wildly popular -- protection against pre-existing conditions , getting kids under 25 on parents’ insurance . </s>
All of these things are wildly popular . And yes , it 's true , the Republican Party did not -- this was a closed vote . You know why that is ? </s>
It 's because we live in a world not like the one 20 , 30 years ago , where you had a responsible Republican party , where you had moderate Republicans -- Oh . Ooh ! Just like , as my colleague said . </s>
The ideas in this plan were virtually identical in the broad framework to what the Republicans were proposing just 12 years ago . It 's what Mitt Romney said . This is not a radical plan . John Shadegg , equal time for you on that . </s>
I think it 's offensive to say that the Republican Party is irresponsible . </s>
You know , I 'm sorry . I take offense at that . I have offered healthcare reform bills every year I 've been in Congress . </s>
There are many . I 'm sorry the woman over there did n't hear them . Yes , Republicans passed the opportunity when they hold both majorities of Congress . </s>
But quite frankly , we did not have the demand that we have now seen . But how do you defend the fact that broad consensus is necessary to support this legislation ? Have you defended it other than to say -- other than to say , well , back then , the Republican Party was responsible , and now it 's not . </s>
That 's really -- quite frankly , in the context of what happened last week , inappropriate . When you pass the Medicare prescription drug program -- Paul Starr . </s>
When you pass the Medicare prescription drug program , the polls ran two to one against it among seniors and the general population . </s>
Eighty percent of people in polls said this is too complicated . You did it anyway . And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
And here 's where we are . We are about to hear brief closing remarks from each of the debaters in turn . They will be two minutes each . And it 's their last chance to try to change your minds to their point of view . </s>
Our motion is `` Repeal Obamacare . '' You 've been asked to vote once . </s>
And we 'll ask you to vote again in just a couple of minutes . But first , round three . </s>
Round three , closing statements from each debater in turn . They will be brief . And first , to speak against our motion , “Repeal Obamacare , ” against repeal , Paul Starr , professor at Princeton University , cofounder and coeditor of the American Prospect and Pulitzer Prize winning author of “The Social Transformation of American Medicine.” Thank you . Two months ago , the editor of an Austrian newspaper , a conservative , by the way , asked me how Americans could possibly oppose giving health insurance to the millions who do n't have it . </s>
To Europeans across the political spectrum , it 's unthinkable to withhold health insurance , just as we would regard it as unthinkable to deny an education to children . The Austrians , the French , the Germans , who have excellent medical care , do n't become uninsurable when they get ill . </s>
They do n't get locked into a job for fear of losing health coverage . Universal coverage makes it more secure , and it actually makes them more free . But every time the issue of universal coverage has arisen here , the opponents have used innuendo and fear to defeat health reforms that are common to every other advanced democracy . And last year , we finally broke through that drum beat of fear with moderate legislation and to creating a more just and efficient system to cover the excluded and create mechanisms to slow the growth in costs . </s>
Repealing the law would mean denying coverage to more than 30 million people . </s>
It would mean repealing the laws ' protections against abusive insurance practices , some of which have already gone into effect like barring the rescission of policies just because the subscriber gets sick . It would mean giving up a whole series of cost-containment measures that show a lot of promise for reign in medical inflation . But even more importantly , repeal would be a concession of political helplessness in the face of a problem that has nagged at the national conscience for a century . </s>
It would be a confession that we simply are not capable of the elementary decency toward the sick that characterizes every other advanced democracy . </s>
There are surely changes that should be made in the law . </s>
And it can be made . But it would be an unspeakable tragedy for millions of people if we were to repeal it . Thank you , Paul Starr . Our motion is `` Repeal Obamacare . '' And here to speak for the motion , for repeal , John Shadegg , former eight-term Congressman from Arizona and a Senior Fellow at the Goldwater Institute . </s>
The current system is broken . There is no question about it . It 's broken because it costs too much , it 's broken because there are too many people who do n't have insurance , and it 's tragically broken because some people are denied care because they have a chronic illness or preexisting condition . </s>
We need to address those problems , and there are lots of reforms that we can to address them . We can allow group pooling . We can force the insurance companies to become cost conscious and to have to compete with each other . We can give you control over your health insurance . </s>
We can move away from third party payer systems . And we can begin to redo the system . But we do n't have to say that it 's not universal care . Indeed , my legislation and other legislation that Republicans have offered provide universal coverage . </s>
My legislation says you give every single American a tax credit . For the poor , you give them a refundable tax credit , an amount of money . </s>
In the Coburn legislation and the Ryan legislation , you write specific dollar amounts for people to buy health insurance , and it 's cash in their hands to go buy a coverage that they choose . So we achieve universal coverage , every single American . You can do universal enrollment as I described , where you 're automatically enrolled in that process . We can deal with the problem of the uninsured without forcing a million Americans who like their current coverage to lose it , which is what Obamacare will do . You will force millions of Americans to lose the coverage they currently have and they currently like . </s>
And we can deal with the problem of preexisting conditions . I had heart bypass surgery . I have a preexisting condition . I care about this issue . </s>
I have an older sister -- my oldest sister , who has breast cancer . </s>
No one should be denied healthcare because they have a preexisting condition . But we can do that without forcing everybody out of the coverage they have now . But rather by creating high risk pools that are funded by all the other insurance companies or by government , and helping those who are in need because they have high risks . Americans will happily pay to support people who have that kind of condition because they don’t know when they will have it next . High risk pools will work for those with preexisting conditions . </s>
John -- John Shadegg , your time is up . </s>
Thank you very much . </s>
Our motion is , `` Repeal Obamacare . '' And to speak in his closing remarks against the motion , Jonathan Cohn , senior editor at the New Republic , Senior Fellow at Demos , and author of `` Sick : The Untold Story of America’s Healthcare Crisis and the People Who Pay the Price . '' There was a question at some point that talked about the human side to this , and I wanted to just take this and say that’s where I started . About 15 years ago I started interviewing people all over the country , and I met people who had their own firsthand experiences with the healthcare system , and I remember very , very vividly a man in upstate New York who had a good job , a good college education , was a defense contractor , he lost that job , he got the job back , but without benefits , and because of that , two years his wife who was ill did not get any medical visits , ended up she had cancer , it went undiagnosed , she died , and the family had to declare bankruptcy . </s>
For me , hearing that story and literally hundreds like it is where this all starts for me . This is a problem we have had in this country for a long time . It is a problem that keeps getting worse . Two years ago we had a presidential election . </s>
And we debated , what are we going to do about this ? One , President Obama won , the Democrats got in and this was job number one . They reached out to the Republicans . </s>
They took ideas that Republicans had for years claimed as their own and said , `` All right , we’ll meet you halfway , and we’ll try -- we will come up with a plan that builds on your ideas and our ideas and we’ll work together . '' And the Republicans walked away , and they said , `` Fine . We have to go it alone , we’ll go it alone . '' But they kept the same ideas , they took the best from left and right , and what did they get ? </s>
It’s not a perfect plan , but it is a plan that will mean 30 million people have health insurance . </s>
It will mean that the insurance people have will be good insurance that will cover what they need . It will mean that people will have financial assistance . Congressman Shadegg never tells you this part of his plan , but the credit he would offer people isn’t enough to pay for a good plan and people with pre-existing conditions , it would basically work out to second class insurance for second class people . </s>
This is the plan they 're talking about . The cost control , not perfect , it could be better , fine , as Doug Holtz-Eakin , himself , said , these are the same ideas , we all agree on them , let 's work together and double them down . But repeal Obamacare ? Tom Harkin said , `` This is a starter house , it’s got a good foundation , and it’s got room for expansion . '' I say let’s keep that foundation , let’s build onto it , and let’s not repeal Obamacare , let’s not start over , let’s go forward . </s>
Thank you , Jonathan Cohn . Our motion is `` Repeal Obamacare . '' </s>
And finally , to speak for the motion , for repeal , Douglas Holtz-Eakin , who is President of the American Action Forum and a former Director of the Congressional Budget Office and former advisor to John McCain . </s>
I thank you for listening tonight and this is ultimately a debate about our future and I don’t think anyone should question the aspirations or good will of either side of this stage in terms of what one would like in affordable coverage for every American and access to high quality care . Those values are shared . </s>
What is at issue is what is the best way to go forward and to try to build on this foundation , one that is riddled with financial cancer and one that has only window dressing at attempting to deal with the real problems of the American healthcare system is a dangerous place to begin and it should be repealed in favor of a real future of the American healthcare system . Now , we’ve heard that somehow the Republicans got all their ideas and I believe that the vigorous debate tonight would stipulate that’s not the case . This is not something on which we can build a future . </s>
This is a dangerous beginning . It does not fix the broken programs that are threatening the financial future of the United States . Medicare and Medicaid are not touched by this program . They are important pieces of the social welfare system in the United States . </s>
They deserved the attention of the healthcare reform . They were dismissed as unimportant . </s>
Instead we got a strategy to double down on those broken failures and try to write checks to paper over a broken system and in the process we are threatening the very future of this country , threatening the freedom and prosperity of Americans on which the healthcare system and everything else will be built . And we are most tragically doing it at the expense of our youngest and most vulnerable , our kids . They didn’t get a vote . </s>
They aren’t going to be able to believe what we have done to them when they grow up . </s>
They will pay the bills now . </s>
They will pay the bills later . They won’t see higher quality care . They’ll see more expensive care . And we will , in the process , take many of them into systems that ostensibly give them “access” but where no physician can treat them , no hospital will want them in their beds and they will not get good care and they will be broke to boot . Repeal Obamacare today . </s>
Thank you , Douglas Holtz-Eakin and that concludes our closing statements and now it’s time to learn which side has argued best . We’re having you vote twice , once before the debate and again after the debate and we’re going to get the results and choose the winner . We’re asking you to go to the keypad at your seat . </s>
Our motion is “Repeal Obamacare.” If you agree with the motion after hearing the debate , push number one . If you disagree , push number two . </s>
If you remain undecided or became undecided , push number three . </s>
And we’ll have the results of that vote in about 90 seconds but before we get to that , I just want to thank both teams for coming to this debate with the kind of arguments that they did . We aspire to ideas here and we certainly heard them tonight . Thank you to all of our debaters for the way that they conducted themselves and did this -- Thank you also to those of you in the audience who asked questions . I like your passion . </s>
I’m glad that question got in there . Thank you for doing that , for forcing that issue . </s>
We’d like to first of all thank the American Clean Skies Foundation for helping to underwrite this season of debates . This season we have a theme throughout the winter and the spring for all five of our debates . That theme is “America’s House Divided” and we are focusing on themes that reflect this division , this basic philosophical division in our society . Our next debate is Tuesday , February 15th . The motion on that Tuesday night is “Two Party System is Making America Ungovernable.” </s>
Arguing for the motion are New York Times op/ed columnist David Brook and co-founder and editor-in-chief of Huffington Post , Arianna Huffington . Against the motion we have Zev Chaffets who is a journalist and he’s the former director of the government press office in Israel where the system is a parliamentary system and works differently . His partner arguing against the motion is P. J. O’Rourke , a political satirist and author of “Don’t vote , it just encourages the bastards.” Tickets to those debates are available through our Web site and at the Skirball box office and do not forget to follow the Intelligence Squared U.S. on Twitter and to make sure to become a fan on Facebook .

Remember you have been asked to vote twice in this debate , once before and once again at the end . And the team that has changed the most minds is declared our winner . And here it is . Our motion is `` Repeal Obamacare . '' </s>
Before the debate , 17 percent were for repeal . 47 percent against , 36 percent undecided . </s>
After the debate , 22 percent are for “Repeal Obamacare.” </s>
That 's up five percent . Seventy-two percent are against . That 's up 25 percent . Six percent are undecided . </s>
The motion , “Repeal Obamacare” is defeated . That 's it for us at Intelligence Squared . Thank you from John Donvan , and we 'll see you next time . We are starting and I would like to welcome our debaters onto the stage . Thank you for that warm welcome to our debaters and I’d like to also ask for a warm welcome for the chairman and founder of Intelligence Squared US , Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Well , thank you all very much for joining us tonight , you know , the mission of Intelligence Squared , is to encourage our audience to consider both sides of contentious issues . To think twice about their positions . </s>
So one of our panelists tonight , former Governor Eliot Spitzer , has certainly done that . Just last week he thought twice about arguing in favor of tonight’s motion , and decided to argue against it . </s>
When Obama took office , the financial sector had just been saved from collapse by massive government intervention . </s>
That collapse occurred against the backdrop of a relatively benign real economy , with decent growth and high employment . Then in the fourth quarter of ’08 and the first quarter of ’09 , the real economy went into free fall . Economic output shrank , and unemployment rose at rates that we haven’t seen since the Great Depression . </s>
The collapse of the real economy could’ve been a death blow for an already weak financial sector . We were truly on the edge of an economic abyss , and fear itself was becoming a real self-fulfilling prophecy . Well the Obama administration threw every policy weapon it could at the problem . </s>
Zero interest rates , increased money supply , backstops for key financial institutions in the entire automotive industry , and a massive fiscal stimulus package . And confidence has clearly been restored . Businesses are building inventories , consumers are spending , investors are no longer hoarding cash . The stock market is up 19 percent since the beginning of the year , and corporate bonds are up nearly as much . Last quarter , we had 3.5 percent growth in the economy . </s>
It seems that the recession is over , and that Armageddon has been avoided . Is this not a picture of unalloyed success ? Well , not so fast . </s>
Unemployment has increased to 10.5 percent . </s>
We bailed out the banks so that they could provide credit to businesses and consumers , and instead they’re shrinking the loan portfolios . Government deficits are running in the trillions . </s>
Public debt has exploded , and the dollar is collapsing . We may eventually face a stark choice , between default , and inflation . And the private sector , the engine that has powered America’s economic dynamism , is facing the burden of higher tax rates , higher health care costs , carbon taxes , pro- union initiatives , pay czars and other intrusive regulation . With such powerful anti-growth forces in play , can we expect new jobs to put unemployed Americans back to work ? </s>
Well , I’m not going to be the one to answer that question , but I will make a prediction . That tonight’s debate will be lively and informative , and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over to John Donvan , and the outstanding panelists we have with us this evening . Thank you , Robert . Andmay I just invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Well , welcome , everybody , to another debate from Intelligence Squared US , I’m John Donvan of ABC News and once again it is my pleasure to serve as host and moderator , as the six debaters you see sharing the stage here with me at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University , three against three , will be debating this motion , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” Now , I want to point out this is a debate , it’s a contest and although we have some professors on the panels they are not here to lecture , they are here to attack and defend but with ideas well-articulated and well-argued , and in this debate , you our live audience here at the Skirball Center , act as the judges . By the time the evening has ended , you will have voted twice , once before the debate begins and once again at the end , to tell us whether you agree or disagree with the motion . And at the end of the debate the team that has changed the most minds , will be declared our winner . Now , it is time to vote our preliminary vote , and if you go to the keypad on your left side…there’s a range of buttons from 1 to 10 . Ignore all of them but 1 , 2 and 3 . </s>
If you push number 1 it means that you agree with the motion that “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” Number 2 means that you disagree , and number 3 means that you’re undecided . And if you feel that you’ve pushed the buttons incorrectly , just repeat the correct entry and it will update to the current one . </s>
So it looks like everybody’s done that . And so our preliminary vote is in and let’s let the debate begin , Round 1 , opening statements by each debater , seven minutes each . We begin with Mark Zandi who is an economist and the founder of Moody’s Economy.com . During the 2008 Presidential campaign he was an advisor to Senator John McCain , he has since become an advisor to the Obama White House , Mark , I’m not sure what that tells us about which side you’re on… but the floor is yours— </s>
I’m an ecumenical economist , let’s put it that way . I want to thank Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to be here today , it’s certainly an honor to be here and to address such an important topic . I’m going to make three points in my opening remarks . Point number one . </s>
I think it’s really quite amazing the totality of the policy response from the administration , I think , we forget all the things that have been done to try to shore up the economy and we tend to focus on the one or two or three things that we’re most annoyed about , and we focus on that . Let me just spend a few minutes , well , I’ve got six minutes and 30 seconds , let me spend a couple minutes going over that . And there are three broad areas of policy effort here , first is the effort to shore up to the financial system , and this is everything from what the FDIC has done , increasing deposit insurance limits , to guaranteeing bank debt to allow the banks to issue , to efforts by the Treasury to help facilitate all the things that the Federal Reserve Board has been doing to try to provide credit to the financial system and stabilize the financial system . Perhaps the most important thing in my mind with regard to the effort to shore up the financial system , was the banks’ stress tests -- do you remember the stress test , this was done back earlier this year . </s>
And to me , those stress tests were the modern-day equivalent of what FDR did back in the Great Depression , he— I’m going to exaggerate just a little bit but only a little bit . He closed all the banks on a Friday and he said on the subsequent Monday to his Treasury Secretary , open all of them except a couple hundred of them and the Treasury Secretary said to him , well , which ones should I open , and FDR said , well , it really doesn’t matter because the ones you open , everything will think are safe , and life will go on and— In fact it worked , it restored confidence and that was the beginning of the end of the Great Depression and the stress test in fact did that , it restored confidence and the financial system is stable . The second blotter of the policy response was to shore up the two weakest parts of our economy , the housing market and the auto market . </s>
I’m not going to spend much time on the auto market because Steve is so intimately involved in that great effort , and he’ll talk about that , but I know housing , and the efforts to shore up the housing market have been quite amazing , and just to name a few things . The first-time homebuyer tax credit , very important in stabilizing housing values this summer , to help to support buying by first-time home buyers , the loan modification plan to help homeowners who are facing foreclosure , to get their monthly mortgage payments down so that they can afford their , their mortgage payment . </s>
Efforts to provide more credit to the residential mortgage market through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and FHA . Here’s a statistic for you . 90 percent of all the residential mortgage loans being made today are being made by the federal government , so if the federal government wasn’t making those loans , the housing market would be in complete disarray and we’d be in very significant trouble , so the second broad policy effort was to help shore up those two key sectors , the two weakest sectors of our economy . And the third policy response , broadly speaking , is the fiscal stimulus , much maligned , but ultimately at the end of the day , very successful . I don’t think it’s any accident that the recession came to an end , at the same time that the stimulus was providing its maximum economic benefit to the economy . </s>
And the stimulus is lots of things , it’s aid to unemployed workers , it’s helped the state governments , it’s the first-time homebuyer tax credit , it’s Cash for Clunkers , a long list of things , the infrastructure spending , all very important . So , please remember , point number one , that the policy effort is a range of many things , it’s been incredibly— it’s amassing and incredibly unprecedented what has been done here , and key to bringing an end to this Great Recession . Point number two , here are the statistics I think are overwhelming . A year ago , think about a year ago , what was going on , major financial institutions were evaporating or being nationalized , Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac , Lehman , Bear , AIG , Citigroup was on the doorstep of falling apart , and look at the situation today . </s>
The financial system is not normal , no , but it is stable . And banks aren’t lending to us yet as business people and as consumers but they’re moving in that direction , and just imagine where we’d be today without that stability in the financial system . Think about the economic statistics , housing activity , new and existing single-family housing starts hit a low in January , housing construction hit a low in January , back at the beginning of the year , housing values were falling very rapidly , today , the last couple of quarters they’ve actually begun to increase . </s>
GDP , the value of all the things that we produce as an economy , grew 3.5 percent in the third quarter and the growth was very broad- based , that was the first substantive growth in over a year and a half . And clearly driving the economy forward , the GDP in the fourth quarter , the current quarter , is on track to be positive again . The job market . </s>
Last thing to improve , but it is improving , we’re moving in the right direction . We—just to give you a statistic , at the beginning of the year , we were losing 700,000 jobs on average every single month . In the last three months we lost 200,000 jobs a month , now I know , that’s a lot of jobs , unemployment is still rising . But the trend lines are right , they’re moving in the right direction and my view is by early next year , we will have a stable job market , and by the end of next year , we will have job growth that’s meaningful enough to bring down the rate of unemployment , so everything is moving in the right direction . Finally , point number three , I said there were three points… The proposition is , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” </s>
It’s not , they have worked . This is not a mission accomplished , no one is arguing that this is over and done with , we have more work to do , and the administration is still working . Just last week , they passed another piece of legislation to help extend unemployment insurance benefits for people who lose their jobs in 2009 , now if you become unemployed in 2009 you have 99 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits , they extended , and they expanded the first- time homebuyer tax credit into next year to provide support to the housing market , and they’ve provided a number of other supports . They are debating right now and will likely pass other efforts to shore up the economy , extend some of the other provisions in the stimulus to make sure that the stimulus provides benefit to the economy as we make our way into 2010 . And more importantly and perhaps most importantly , we are working through some of the structural problems in our economy , working on the hard , difficult issues , the most obvious would be financial regulatory reform . </s>
Now this is something you don’t want to do quickly , you don’t want to make a mistake . Our financial regulatory structure has been in place since the Great Depression . It feels like it , and we have got to take time to make it right . So , in my view , what the administration has done has been highly successful . </s>
Thank you , Mark Zandi . And I just want to point out the amazing virtuosity of Mark Zandi who was watching the clock the whole time , and he said “Thank you” as the clock that’s in front of us you can’t see , turned to zero . It’s just about perfect . </s>
Our motion is “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively” and our first debater to argue against the motion , James Galbraith of the University of Texas , he generally argues from the left , he also has a rather scathing view of economists in the United States in general , he has said that , on all important policy issues , they are on the wrong side , himself an economist , James Galbraith . </s>
Thank you very much . </s>
The question before the house may appear political . But it in fact is not . One person on our panel as you’ve heard , shifted his position to argue our side . </s>
Two of us , supported President Obama in the last election and all three of us hope that he will succeed . The question is about the economy , it is about whether the economic program is working effectively . Lawrence Summers , the Chief Economic Advisor to the President , told the Washington Post on November 8th , quote , “I think we got the Recovery Act right . The primary objective of our policy is having more work done , more product produced , and more people earning more income.” We agree with that standard . </s>
The economy is not performing up to that standard . Basically , if you leave aside the actions some of which Mark mentioned such as the extension of deposit insurance by the FDIC , that were taken under the Bush administration , the Obama economic program…the principal points are two . One is the Recovery Act , the stimulus bill , and the other is the policy of providing free reserves , credit at zero interest rate , to the banking system in the hopes that credit will flow again . So the question before us is , was the stimulus sufficient , and secondly , is credit flowing again . Now the stimulus did some good things , it helped forestall the complete collapse of budgets in the state and local government sector , it created some construction jobs and will create more . </s>
It has provided some tax relief . The question is , is it enough . I think it is pretty clear , that it was not enough . The stimulus was enacted based on a forecast that unemployment would not rise past about 8 percent by the middle of this year , would decline thereafter , that forecast was clearly wildly optimistic . It underestimated the state and local crisis where job cuts , or , just offsetting , the jobs created with federal funds . </s>
It did too little too late to meet the foreclosure crisis which is presently running at several million homes a year . Let me quote a distinguished economist . </s>
On November 6th , 2009 , he wrote , “After rising for more than two and a half years the country’s unemployment rate crossed into double-digit territory in October , with a jobless rate of 10.2 percent . This provides another sign of the severity of the current downturn , the very long road we face back to full employment , and the urgent need for more policy action to create jobs and protect those who can’t find work . With such a huge fire , we need every hose we can find to put it out.” I agree with that . </s>
There is an urgent need for more policy action . Who said it ? Why , Larry Mishel , President of the Economic Policy Institute said it just 10 days ago . What you said… if you say this , that you also agree with Larry Summers , that the Recovery Act got it right . Now I am not an economic forecaster . </s>
But there are forecasters I greatly respect , and here is what one of them testified to Congress , on October 29th . </s>
“It is growing clear , ” he said , “that more policy help will be needed to ensure that the tentative recovery evolves into a self-sustaining expansion . Although a double-dip downturn is less than likely , meaningful threats to the recovery still exist . </s>
Most notable , are the intensifying stresses in the job market , the ongoing foreclosure crisis , the boom and bust in the commercial real estate market the dysfunctional structured finance market and the fiscal woes of state and local governments.” Quite an impressive list and I hesitate to say this in a theater but it sounds like other than that , Mrs. Lincoln , how did you enjoy the play . To go on , “Congress must provide more resources to unemployed workers , whose benefits are running out , to state and local governments unable to balance their budgets and to household and businesses looking to buy homes and invest.” </s>
I agree with that . </s>
Congress must provide more resources . Who said it . Why , Mark Zandi said it , founder of Moody’s Economy.com , just two weeks ago . Would you say this , if you agreed with Larry Summers , that the Recovery Act got it right . </s>
Now it’s true , free money has saved the banks , everyone knows this , from their profit reports and their bonuses . The stock market has come back and so has the price of oil . Is this enough ? We think not . We think the housing crisis is important , we think the collapse of small business is important , we think 10 percent unemployment as far as the eye can see is a disaster . </s>
We know as every business in America knows that credit is not flowing again . What would a working program look like . First it would dissolve rather than coddle the toxic banks . It would stop the displacement of people from their homes , not just slow it , not just help a few , but stop the displacement of people from their homes . It would help all their workers who are ready to leave their jobs , to retire by providing them with a more comfortable employment , and health care that they can count on at an earlier age than 65 , opening up places for younger people who are looking for jobs in today’s catastrophic labor market . </s>
And it would fund a lot of new green jobs , all across the country , providing every American who wants a chance to work , for the duration , until the private sector comes back , revives and is able to take up the slack . On our side , we don’t agree , on all of the issues . But on the issues just outlined and I submit they are the essential issues , the facts are plain . </s>
Better than nothing is not good enough . There was a poll…released just a few days ago on November 6th , which stated that 47 percent of Americans think that the economy is still the most important issue , that’s against all the other issues that might be considered . The American people know what this is about . They do not think that the program is working effectively , and that is surely telling . If it were working effectively , they would know . </s>
Thank you very much . Well….we just had another one of those one-second accomplishments . Next to argue for the motion , we asked the White House if they would provide a member of the administration to take part in the debate , they did not want to do that , but they suggested our next debater , Larry Mishel who is the president of the Economic Policy Institute , so Larry—I’m not saying you’re the White House’s guy . </s>
But , now everybody’s going to think of you that way as , as you get up , but the floor is yours . Well , I hope I get invited to the next official state dinner then— You know , as an economist , over my career I’ve been focused on what are the living standards of the American people , the working class . How they’ve done , and so what has mattered to me most on economic policy , is in fact , what have we done to create jobs , to get the unemployment rate down . And so I’m going to focus on the Recovery Act . And I’m here to say that I think it has actually been a bold and effective act . </s>
No , it has not solved all our economic problems . It has not solved the unemployment problem . That is not quite the standard that you should imagine , for judging whether the policies are effective . Let me just say—my imagery for all this . </s>
President Obama inherited a really large apartment building , it was all aflame , afire . </s>
He gathered all the fire trucks and hoses he could , and he put out the flames , in at least half the floors . </s>
But the critics say , look , there’s still fire and so your policies must be wrong . And especially , it turns out , these critics are the conservatives who actually lit the darn fire . And they tried to keep the fire hoses from actually getting to the fire building . I think it’s actually quite outrageous . </s>
Now it’s a somewhat different— I think it’s somewhat different to my longtime , I don’t have any old friends , only have longtime friends , Jamie Galbraith . But we’ll get around to that . So let me talk at first about what the fire was . Mark talked about it . Over the nine months that included the last half of 2008 and the first three months of 2009 , none of which were the responsibility of President Obama , okay , we had the fastest decline in the economy , basically since they started collecting the data in 1947 on a quarterly basis . </s>
We had already seen six million jobs lost by March 2009 . The unemployment rate was already 8.5 percent , which is the highest it was since the great , really deep recession of the early 1980s . So we were in deep…you know what . </s>
And so we had the Recovery Act which was passed very quickly and effectively , actually started having some effect in March , but mostly started having an effect in April . And I want to go through exactly what it does , so it’s not an abstraction . What are the different components . </s>
First as Mark mentioned , support to the unemployed , and helping them not only with unemployment benefits and higher benefits , extended benefits , and health care , and a major increase in food stamps . </s>
Why does that matter . By supporting their incomes and their spending it creates jobs , throughout the economy . Secondly . There was a major influx of money to state governments , who , by resolving their own deficits when they have to cut programs and raise taxes , they actually -- what Paul Krugman said is they are like 50 little Herbert Hoovers . </s>
They are driving us into recession , by actually exacerbating the problem . Okay . When you give them the money , they don’t cut the programs , they keep the people that work for them in the local government’s employ . </s>
To keep the contractors and the private sector delivering construction contracts , health care , nursing homes , et cetera , employed , and by all those people being employed through spending money they keep jobs going throughout the economy . Okay , there’s also a third , a tax cut that was in effect in April , everybody’s withholding on their W-2’s , was actually increased , providing more income , more money to spend . Last there was some government spending in infrastructure that started going out . But the main infrastructure spending , actually is scheduled for 2010 . That’s when we get the energy alternatives , that’s when we get more infrastructure , and other things that are going to create productivity in the long run as well as create jobs . </s>
What has been the effect of all this spending ? Well as Mark said , over the last six months , we’ve actually seen a much different outcome than what was projected in the springtime , the economy shrank by a little bit , it would’ve shrunk by around 4 percent , but it actually shrank by a little bit less than 1 percent . In the summer the economy actually grew . Now , as someone dedicated to raising the living standards of the entire broad middle class , who’s satisfied with that , I’m not satisfied with that , okay ? </s>
But the question is , are you going to judge the Obama administration policy ineffective , because it hasn’t corrected what I think is 30 years of generating inequality , false-hearted , silly deregulation and worshipping of markets where we shouldn’t have done it that got us into this darn mess ? I don’t think that’s quite appropriate . </s>
Thank you—don’t take my time . </s>
Um— We calculate that the Recovery Act has actually created anywhere between 1.1 to 1.5 million jobs by the end of September . I’m not satisfied that the job losses are 200,000 rather than 700,000 , but I think it’s quite great . I’m very worried about the fact that unemployment is going to be high for many years to come , too high . </s>
I don’t blame that on President Obama , I blame that on the bums that put us in this mess . And you should too . </s>
Now , it’s true that the unemployment rate is higher than what the administration said it was going to be . They said if we did the Recovery Act it was going to only get to 8 percent . </s>
Well , let me mention something . The unemployment rate in March , before the Recovery Act even had an effect was already 8.5 percent . Now I did tell my friends in the White House , that’s a silly thing , don’t project like that . </s>
You shouldn’t do that , you’re going to get caught by that , and in fact , they have been hung by their own petard so to speak . But the fact is that , let me tell you that this is not a policy failure . </s>
This is a failure of my profession , economists . If you look at what economists projected right at the time of the election , the blue- chip forecasts , and look at that same period I told you about , the nine months that includes the last half of last year and the first three months of this year . </s>
Now they’re already halfway through that period . And they were saying that the economy was going to shrink at a 1.5 percent rate , over that nine-month period . And it actually shrank by three times that much . So the fact is , what the administration got wrong in its forecast was it didn’t have a right sense of what things were going to be without the policy . </s>
I think they got the policy right , the policy’s had a substantial impact . </s>
Now has it solved all our problems , the fact is I’m not so sure how much more could’ve been done , economically . </s>
I can darn well tell you that politically , there was not much more on the table that they could get . What was put through the House and was put through the Senate , what was stopped , is some people that were in the Senate , who are known as moderates which just means they want to do a little bit less of what everybody else— </s>
Larry Mishel—your time is up . And thank you very much . So here is where we are , we are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared US debate , I’m John Donvan of ABC News . We have six debaters , two teams out there , fighting it out over this motion , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” And now on to our fourth debater . </s>
Allan Meltzer who is an economist at Carnegie Mellon University , he is not the liberal member of his team , he is far from it . And if you caught CNBC a few days ago Allan Meltzer appeared there and I quote , “We have an administration that spends and spends and lies.” Ladies and gentlemen , Allan Meltzer . I’m here to talk about the Obama policy , not about apartment house fires . The policy has had a mixed result . </s>
There’re some small positive effects . But , there are five reasons for concluding the policies are not working effectively . First , the forecast was that $ 780 billion would be spent , the maximum unemployment rate would be 8 percent . </s>
Second , it’s now 10.2 percent , continuing to rise , that’s a failure . The second , is the administration recognition that the policy has failed . </s>
If the policy had succeeded , they would not be talking about another stimulus program , it recognizes , that talk recognizes , that the stimulus was not effective . That their policies have , so far , been very weak . Third , the administration invented something called “jobs saved.” </s>
You can search economic textbooks from now to the end of time , you will not find something called “jobs saved.” Jobs saved , how do you know if you job is saved . Sure , it was true that , if we paid the states to have a smaller deficit , they didn’t fire quite so many teachers . </s>
But , we also shifted the deficit , to the federal government , with higher future tax rates that are going to have to pay for those , over the long term . This administration has failed on the main thing that it needs to do , which is to tell us , how are we going to get out of this mess . </s>
The composition of the stimulus is the fourth problem . That was decided in the Congress . It was a mistake by the Obama administration to let it be decided in the Congress , because the Congress was interested much more in the redistribution of wealth than it was in seeing jobs and the economy improved . </s>
One-third of the stimulus went to state and local governments , for their deficits . That may be good or bad policy , but it has very little stimulus . </s>
It simply transfers the deficit from one place to another . Also , a big piece of the stimulus went for a temporary tax cut . </s>
We’ve had lots of evidence on temporary tax cuts . The Bush administration , the Ford administration , the Carter administration , they all tried temporary tax cuts . </s>
The economic evidence is , temporary tax cuts don’t do much . </s>
The only major stimulating tax cuts that we’ve had in the post-war period were the Kennedy-Johnson tax cuts , and the Reagan tax cuts . </s>
They were permanent tax cuts , people knew that once they got them , they were theirs . Finally fifth . This program is so off the block . </s>
Do you remember shovel-ready projects ? Well , only 25 percent of the dollars for the infrastructure have been spent . Maybe that part of the program will do some good when it gets started , but the economy is in a slow recovery . So that part of the program is hardly a success . Now the economy has recovered , and the members of the affirmative tell us about how much better things are than they were a year ago . </s>
But is that a result of the Obama policy , or is it the natural tendency of the economy when it sinks , when inventories get very low , to be rebuilt , because that’s where a lot of the third-quarter improvement came from , the rebuilding of inventories . Very little of it in consumption . Most of the recovery in the third quarter came from temporary clunkers , and housing . The housing policy is full of corruption . People come in and ask for the $ 8,000 , they send their children , because they’ve already bought a house , they send their children to do it , the Washington Post had a long expose of the corruption in the housing problem . </s>
I believe that we have the wrong policy . The problem for the United States for the future , the problem that we are all going to face for a long time to come , is that we have a huge debt , that a lot of , part of it is owed to foreigners , and it’s growing . </s>
So , you don’t have be to an academic economist to figure out that the way we’re going to pay for that is to export . </s>
And the way to export more , would be to invest more , and earn our way out of that problem . What the administration is doing is the wrong thing . It’s trying to build up consumption . </s>
Fortunately , it isn’t being very successful . Now the CBO , the Congressional Budget Office , says we have a debate explosion . It’s unsustainable . It’s headed toward a debt crisis . </s>
The Congressional Budget Office says that every 10-point increase , percentage point increase in the debt ratio , lowers GDP growth by a quarter percent . This administration is increasing the debt by 50 percentage points . That’s a policy failure . The government debt to GDP ratio was about 50 percent , when the administration took office . The CBO trajectory says , it’s going to 700 percent . </s>
700 percent is not a point we’re going to reach , because it’s unsustainable . That means , we’re headed , unless we do something about the exploding debt , we’re going to have a crisis . We absorb a considerable part of world savings , that too is unsustainable . Why . Well , the Bush drug bill . </s>
The Obama health care bill . A great many of the things that the Congress does , increase the deficit . </s>
You can’t believe , that we’re going to cut Medicare by $ 500 billion in order to get the drug bill passed . But that’s what you have to believe , if you believe that this administration is going to give you health care without paying . We are on an unsustainable policy , and it’s a failed policy . </s>
Many years ago I started to tell people , capitalism without failure , is like religion without sin . Governor Spitzer’s going to talk about that in the context— In the context…in the context of the banking system— Allan Meltzer , your time is up . Thank you . Vote no ! </s>
Our motion is , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” And our next debater , who will be arguing for the motion , Steve Rattner , who has gone through many careers . </s>
He began as a journalist . He switched to finance . Good call , by the way . </s>
And he recently had the beginning of a political career as a treasury official . He came to the White House and was given the job of the auto rescue—the GM deal , that’s him . The Chrysler deal , that’s him . However , he does not like the term Car Czar , which is too bad , because it’s very musical . </s>
Well , my paternal grandparents , who were fur peddlers in Moscow , would be rather shocked at the idea that I was a Czar of any kind , so I will ... I don’t have anything to follow Allan Meltzer’s last remark , I’m afraid ... But I was struck listening to the first two speakers from the other side . I feel a little bit like Goldilocks . I heard one speaker that we in the Obama Administration were too hot and I heard one sort of imply we were too cold . And that makes me think we got it about right . </s>
All kidding aside , I actually do want to make a serious point . And with all due respect to the first two speakers from the other side , I want to try to take the ethereal world of theory and connect it to the real world of politics . </s>
Because I heard a few things that kind of , that did strike me . </s>
I heard Jamie say , Congress must provide more resources . </s>
We must resolve the toxic banks . We can’t let it be decided by Congress . Well , who else decides things besides Congress ? We have to stop the displacement of people from their homes . I mean , these are all wonderful phrases but this is , as I found in my six months in Washington , not how the world works . </s>
As Rahm Emanuel said the other day , It’s fine to imagine yourself sitting under a shady tree at the Aspen Institute thinking of great policies . But then eventually you have to come to grips with the real world and deal with it . </s>
So you can say , people can say our stimulus program was not enough , but the fact is , as Larry said just at the end of his remarks , it was all Congress was going to pass . There was no more there . It took every ounce of political muscle that the administration had to get that . You can say it was too much but I think as Larry Summers has said many times , when you are facing a potential disaster you err on the side of doing more , not less . </s>
And they did as much as was possible . So I just want to try to again connect back to this sort of real world of politics and of getting things done that was really one of the biggest surprises that I found coming to Washington . We may all talk about the President and say , It’s the President’s decision . </s>
The President recommends this , the President does that . But there is a little thing called Congress that has to be dealt with as well and that becomes a series of gives and takes and judgments . And so when Jamie Galbraith says , All Obama did was two things : the stimulus program and the low interest rates—which actually wasn’t even Obama . </s>
That was the Federal Reserve—it’s really not fair . I think the Obama Administration – and we’ll talk more about autos in a minute—but this Financial Regulatory Reform which has been put forward , this energy which has been put forward , this health care which has been put forward , this housing which has been put forward—all these problems that were unattended to for the last eight years , this administration is trying its hardest to address in a thoughtful , responsible way . Let me turn for a minute now to the auto sector as well because I think my two fellow panelists made very , very coherent and logical and I hope ultimately persuasive cases for why the rest of the policy actions that the administration took were thoughtful . And so let me talk for a second about autos . Because it was an interesting area . </s>
It’s one of the few areas where the President actually did have authority . And so if you don’t like what the President did on autos , it’s fair to blame the administration for that because we didn’t have to go to Congress . We had TARP money . </s>
We didn’t have to deal with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC , except in one fairly minor way . </s>
We were pretty free to act . And when we showed up we had a bunch of people from one side of the aisle saying , You’ve got ta let these companies fail . You’ve got ta let the market work . </s>
I’m sorry I don’t have any quotes from Jamie , but I did see one quote from Allan when I was poking around where , when Lehman Brothers went out of business Allan said , No big deal . </s>
It’s fine . That’s the way -- you should have consequences from capitalism . That’s the way it should work . And then a year later he said Lehman Brothers should have been saved . And so we had a lot of people saying to us , Oh , just let the market work . </s>
Well , I hope the people who said , Let’s just let the market work , knew what that would have meant . It would have meant that Chrysler and GM would have shut down by the end of March . It would have meant that hundreds of suppliers would have gone out of business . They all would have liquidated . It would have meant that Ford would have stopped making cars because they wouldn’t have been able to get parts because their suppliers , many of them , would have been shut down . </s>
And you would have had something like three million people out of work , mostly in the industrial Midwest right at the end of March , right when the economy was at its worst . So it’s fine to say , Let’s let the market work . But again , let’s try to connect it back to the real world and what the real world consequences would be of letting that happen . </s>
Then you had some people , frankly , on the other side who basically said , You can’t let these companies go bankrupt . It would be catastrophic , it would be a disaster . </s>
Nobody would buy cars . </s>
They would eventually liquidate . You can’t possibly do that . But President Obama made the decision that we weren’t going to simply kick the can down the road , frankly , the way the previous administration had , and we were only going to inject money in the context of a fundamental restructuring that might have to include bankruptcy , which it ultimately did . And we achieved unprecedented sacrifices from all the stakeholders—from the lenders , from the UAW , from the suppliers , from the dealers , from everybody who was affected—came to the table and , frankly , with a fair amount of muscle from the administration , participated in this restructuring . </s>
And the result of that was that today General Motors announced their earnings . They’re still losing money but their performance was wildly better than anybody would have guessed . </s>
They have forty-two billion dollars of cash in the bank at the moment and they are performing well ahead of the expectations that we had . They’re out of bankruptcy . Chrysler is out of bankruptcy in alliance with Fiat . </s>
So I think it is a very vivid example of a place where we weren’t too hot , we weren’t too cold . </s>
We were very pragmatic . We addressed the problem , we focused on it and we tried to come up with the best solution for all concerned . And I think that that exercise , which I was proud to be a small part of , was emblematic of the approach that this administration has taken . Tim Geithner and Larry Summers , the two principal economic policy makers , have strong views of principle but they are experienced , they are pragmatic . </s>
They know how to get things done . They are balanced and they are very thoughtful . And I think that the approach that they have taken throughout this process has been enormously positive and has led to all the things that you heard Larry and Mark talk about in terms of bringing this country back from the abyss , bringing us back from a depression and getting us started down the road . Of course , I think it was—I forget who on the other side said—47 percent of people think the economy is the most important issue . </s>
Of course it’s the most important issue . But that doesn’t mean we haven’t made good progress . That doesn’t mean that disaster hasn’t been averted and those green shoots that people talk about have begun to sprout . So I was very proud to be a part of that and I would simply say to you , Would you prefer this administration or the last administration or some other administration ? Because I think this administration has done awfully well . </s>
Thank you , Steve Rattner . Our motion is , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” And here as our final speaker , to argue against the motion : Eliot Spitzer , the former Attorney General and Governor of New York—a man whose career has been marked much in headlines , some that were favorable , some that were not . He is , however , at this point in the media himself , having become a financial columnist for Slate . And I want to point out to our audience that when this debate was conceived , Eliot was actually going to argue the other side . </s>
He was going to say the economic policies are working effectively . </s>
He has switched sides now . And Eliot , I hope in your opening remarks you address the basic question : What’s that all about ? Sure . Well , that was not a proposition , but thank you . First , first even , before I do that , John , well , let me just thank Allan Meltzer . </s>
If I follow his logic I have found religion . The short answer to your question is that I read Mark’s testimony . </s>
I was going to say , Mark , Thank you very much . We were on the same side and then I read his very persuasive testimony that he provided—testified before Congress a few weeks ago . And he goes through point by point—and I’ll get to it in a moment—that the terror that we are facing , and how treacherous the shoals are that we are going to run up against in a very short order economically—and I said , My goodness , this is not working at all . </s>
And so , Mark , thank you for persuading me . I will distribute it at the end of the day and you can all be -- I think you will vote our side once you have read Mark’s testimony . I’m sure you will next time around . Well , let me also say very clearly that the Obama Administration’s economic policies , in my mind , stand for continuity you can believe in . </s>
We are still giving away vast sums of money to the same people with the same result so the bank profits are way up , unemployment is up , investment is not increasing , consumption is not increasing and we are not seeing any of the wise transformation in the fundamental structure of our economy that this crisis calls for . We all remember— We all remember Rahm Emanuel’s often-cited statement that a crisis is a terrible thing to waste . Indeed , it is . </s>
This crisis is the rare opportunity that we have to change the direction of our economy , an economy that has been sliding in the wrong direction for many years . On that proposition we would all agree . </s>
And I think that Larry used a very prescient metaphor of an apartment house that is burning down . And he would say that the Obama Administration came with fire hoses blazing and put out half of the fire . Our perspective is they didn’t call the fire brigade from the next county , that they didn’t say , What can we do to stop the fire ? What can we do from the air ? How can we add other fire retardants to turn this off and make sure that there is not a fire next time around ? </s>
And that is what we have to do , that failure structurally is what we are talking about . Let’s deal with numbers just for a moment . </s>
And these are numbers from Mark’s testimony . They are there out online , of course . These are irrefutable numbers . Unemployment up to 17.5 percent , 26 million people , increasing at the rate of several hundred thousand per month . Yes , the 700,000 a month of that was when we were in free fall . </s>
Right now we are still in free fall— two hundred thousand . </s>
There is not any affirmative news on the job front . </s>
And I will get to General Motors in a moment in terms of what they stand for in terms of jobs . Foreclosures : foreclosures are getting worse , not better . Your testimony—and we all agree—2010 will be worse than 2009 , which was worse than 2008 . Why ? Adjustable rate mortgages are going to reset next year . </s>
Fewer and fewer home owners will be able to afford to make their mortgage payments . That crisis continues unabated . And one of the things the Obama Administration did not do that it should have done was push for the legislative power to give judges the power to reform mortgages in the bankruptcy context . I , at that point , when I saw that , I said , How could they not do this ? It is fundamental , it is necessary , it is right . </s>
It would help the middle class that we supposedly care about most fundamentally . The number , by the way : foreclosures are up twenty-three percent this year over last year and it will get worse . Commercial real estate , we care about it less , other than as it affects the banking community . </s>
You in your testimony say hundreds of banks will go bankrupt next year as a result of the mortgages in the commercial real estate sector that simply can not be refinanced—grossly undervalued , still accounting gimmicks . They are left , right and center . We have not faced to it . It will be a disaster . Credit markets are dysfunctional . </s>
Your word , we all agree with it . Credit markets are dysfunctional . Small , medium sized businesses can not borrow , simply can not borrow , even though we have given trillions of dollars to the megabanks that came crawling to Washington , say , Please , please , please , we can’t pay our bonuses . State and local governments— We won’t even get into it cause I only have 2:52 left . </s>
The AIG conduit payments to Goldman , the 12.9 billion , 100 percent on the counter party payments—absolutely outrageous . Tim Geithner must explain this to the American public . </s>
Absolutely outrageous . State and local governments will be going bankrupt . They are down ten , 15 percent in their revenues . </s>
We have handled it for one year . They will go over a precipice next year . That will lead to the full-time shutdown of school districts , fire districts , community services . That is where we are seeing it because property values will plummet , property revenues will plummet . </s>
Sales tax revenue , real estate revenues—all dramatically down . General Motors today—Steve , you’re right . GM had better numbers today . Third quarter they only lost $ 1.12 billion . </s>
Congratulations . We’re on the road to recovery . Let me tell you something . Do you know where they saw signs of improvement ? </s>
Their China subsidiaries . Look at , disaggregate the numbers , really read what happened . China sales are up twenty , 30 , 40 percent , first quarter to third quarter . </s>
Sales in the U.S. down . Next year’s market , they had been presuming under your plan 12 and a half million auto sales next year , calendar year 2010 . </s>
And the U.S. economy downgraded to eleven today . Think about that and what that means . They will not survive . Chrysler will probably go over the cliff as well . They’re going to be selling Fiats . </s>
That’s their business model . It won’t work . Let’s be real about this . Manufacturing jobs , we are losing . </s>
We have lost a third of our manufacturing jobs in the last decade . They do not come back , ever . You look month after month over the last decade , good times and bad , they do not come back . </s>
It is worse now than it’s ever been . That is the core of our economy . We can not all be lawyers and investment bankers . We need clients . The clients are all gone . </s>
It doesn’t work . The fundamental error of this administration is that it is continuity . They have embraced the Bush Administration view that if you solve the problem of big banks everything else flows from that . They are wrong . </s>
Too big to fail is too big . They don’t get it . The only two people I know who don’t appreciate that are Tim Geithner and Larry Summers . Paul Volcker , Alan Greenspan , Henry Kaufman , Mervyn King—every major academic has said , We must get rid of too big to fail . They refuse to cross that threshold . </s>
Until they do we will not reform the financial services sector and that is where they have focused to the exclusion of virtually the entire rest of the economy . They do not appreciate the power they had . They do not know how to negotiate for the fundamental change . </s>
We’ve been involved in what I call a regulatory charade , pretending the problem was lack of power . And the regulators , they had the power , they chose not to use it . Who were those regulators ? </s>
The same folks we’re now promoting and sitting there making these misguided policies . It’s time for more fundamental change . Call in the fire brigade from the next county . </s>
Let’s put out the fire . Thank you very much . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being argued , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively.” </s>
And as you recall , at the beginning of the evening we asked you to vote on whether you agree or disagree with the motion . </s>
And we now have the results from our live audience . Before the debate , the motion being , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively”—before the debate 32 percent of you are for the motion , 29 percent against and 39 undecided . That is where things started . </s>
You will vote again at the conclusion and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . Now , on to round two . It’s our middle round and this is the round where the debaters go more head to head . They’ll be taking questions from you , the audience , and from myself as well . </s>
And I would like to start by lifting something from what Eliot Spitzer just said . He came up with five words that more or less sum up their position—we are still in free fall . </s>
Is it true ? </s>
Anybody on the team arguing for ? I’ll take a crack at it . No . </s>
In a word . </s>
Do you remember back a year ago ? Do you remember ? That’s free fall . That’s when we were panicked , when there were runs on major banking institutions— Wachovia , Washington Mutual . </s>
You were afraid to keep your money in your bank . The stock market was in complete free fall . Housing values were falling 5 , 10 , 15 percent . We were losing 700,000 jobs per month . That’s free fall . </s>
Today , we’ve got stability . The policies aren’t magic . They can’t work overnight in a matter of a few months . But look where we are today . </s>
Think about the counter-factual . Think about what the world would look like without these policy responses . </s>
In my strong opinion , we averted what would have been another depression . Yes , this was a very severe recession , but we averted a depression . So , no , we’re not in free fall . </s>
We’re I’d like to ask the audience to – with a show of applause , whether you find that point convincing . Are we— And now to the response of Eliot Spitzer . Well , let’s frame it this way for you , Mark . </s>
There is the easy decision , which is to spend a ton of money . We needed to do that . </s>
We all knew we would . </s>
I don’t think it mattered who the President was , and thankfully , obviously , I am a fervent supporter of the President . We were going to spend a huge sum of money . There are— Eliot , I just want to encourage you to get a little closer to your mic . </s>
I’m sorry . Thanks . </s>
There are three questions that followed that actually matter . Spending the money is the premise . </s>
The first question is who pays for it . </s>
And it’s not so obvious that it needs to be exclusively the tax payers as opposed to those who are equity debt holders and indeed the former executives of the companies . Even though that would be a small number numerically , nonetheless , symbolically important . </s>
So who pays , and we’ve gotten it wrong in that regard . We have not gotten debt and equity to kick in sufficiently . Two : what reform do you get for the money you’re spending ? Because rebuilding the same façade , the same edifice that’s been broken will not get us anywhere . And the primary grievance that I have with this administration is that we are spending the money rebuilding the same structures , the same decision making process that got us to what we are right now . </s>
And third : job creation is the most important metric out there . Great , you’re an economist . I was I was in political science . We can , usually we </s>
Don’t fudge , now , don’t fudge . No , no , no . No , no , no . </s>
Mark , we had a premise and three questions . </s>
— Wait , let me bring in Larry Mishel . </s>
So ... Larry , what ... what you just heard ? But job , job creation— </s>
Eliot , let me , let me bring in Larry Mishel . Sure . Well , I really think it’s worth keeping two things separate . One is the whole financial market issue , which is primarily the motivation of what you’re talking about , Eliot . You’re talking about spending . </s>
And then there’s the question of jobs and the Recovery Act . </s>
And it seems to me that there was nothing foreordained that anyone who got elected was going to actually do what was done and put together a nearly eight hundred billion dollar package to go through Congress—They wouldn’t have been able to get it through Congress—and that was going to be able to move the needle as much as the needle has been moved . Not that we’re to be satisfied . I mean , you know , this is the -- my friends that are fellow liberals—Jamie and Eliot—are basically arguing against the excellent is the enemy of the very , very good . And that is , in my mind , just not really— and especially to have a former elected official do that , just seems otherworldly to me , to tell you the truth . </s>
You know , I’m a close observer of Washington . I watched what the so-called moderates did in the Senate to that stimulus bill . </s>
They took out , a substantial amount of aid to the states . They took out a school modernization program that last summer could have actually rebuilt a lot of schools , created a lot of jobs . And they stuck in there something that was going to be done anyway , which is the ANT relief , which is basically tax relief for wealthy income tax payers . That in effect , is proof positive that they got as much as they could out of the political system . If you wanted to get more you had to have a different Congress . </s>
I don’t think there was a different political strategy . I can </s>
The question before the House is not whether in the very difficult political environment the President’s team did as much as they could . The question before the House is , Are the policies working effectively ? </s>
That’s a question about the economy and not about the politics . </s>
Let’s look at where we are . Let’s try to come to grips with the scale of the disaster . </s>
What has happened here is that the financial wealth of the American middle class in their houses and in their 401k’s and their bank accounts , built up over six or seven decades , has largely evaporated . </s>
It’s a colossal disaster . People who thought they were going to retire on their home equity aren’t going to have it . Delinquency rates in the state of Florida are over 20 percent , foreclosures over 10 percent . This is an incredible thing . If we think now how many jobs we need to get back to where , to fill the hole by 2011 it’s more than five hundred thousand jobs a month , if something hasn’t happened since 1950-51 . </s>
If we want to do it over five years it’s three million jobs over the course of each single year—something that I don’t believe has ever been achieved . </s>
If we’re going to deal with the problem we have to think about the scale of policy that goes well beyond what the political environment in Washington is prepared to deal with and we have to persuade it to change . Otherwise , we are not going to solve these problems . So let me bring that back to Steven Rattner , who is arguing for the motion , the policies are working . And Steven , that’s an argument that they’re conceding , the rescue succeeded . The canoe did not go off the cliff . </s>
But they’re saying going forward , that does not solve where we need to get to . Well , I don’t think any of us would disagree with that . I think , without getting into a big semantic debate over the question , if the question were : Is the economy in a happy place , we’d all be on one side of the table . The question in effect , in my mind , is , Has Obama put forward and tried to implement policies that will have a positive effect on the economy and move it in the right direction ? And I think , I hope we’ve all made a very clear , convincing case that it has , and will . </s>
Nobody would disagree , you guys are great at giving us a litany of what’s wrong . Eliot , you gave us six minutes and forty-five seconds of what’s wrong with the economy and I only heard one or two suggestions what to actually do about it . I don’t know what your suggestion is about General Motors . Is it to let it to go bankrupt and have a couple of million people out of jobs ? </s>
I don’t know what your suggestion is about Goldman Sachs and the derivatives contracts . I don’t like it any better than you do . Would you like the financial system to melt down the way Lehman Brothers did ? </s>
I don’t know what your suggestion is about how to fix regulatory reform , which the administration has put forward a proposal which is mired in all the Congressional politics around it . And I guess , I’m surprised because you were Governor . You know what it’s like up there . </s>
You were the , you showed up in Albany and said , Day one everything changes . And it didn’t because you had the legislature . Well , then let me , I’ll tell you exactly what I would have done . It may take more than two minutes but I’ll limit it . </s>
In terms of cars I would have said , No , we’re not going to just give billions of dollars to a shelvable company . We will say we will buy five hundred thousand battery powered cars two years from now from whatever domestic producer , I don’t care whether it’s GM , Hyundai , Kia . Produce it here , 80 percent produced domestically . </s>
We want to stimulate that type of productivity . That’s— And , no , no , no . And we will build the electric recharging stations , akin to what Eisenhower did , on the interstate system . </s>
Build a new infrastructure . Create , take the money that we gave to Goldman and instead of saying , Here it is , 12.9 billion—use it to create Felix Rohatyns in the infrastructure bank . </s>
That is what we need , that’s where the dollars should have gone . The dollars could have been used in many different ways . Instead , when we made these enormous transfers , based upon nothing more than the say-so that we need it—which they didn’t because they’ve said they didn’t have any exposure to the AIG CDS , situation . They were fully hedged . We didn’t ask for anything back . </s>
It was the failure to ask for anything back that was fundamentally wrong and that is why we are left with the same system we had before . Let me ask Allan Meltzer . Aren’t , aren’t we , are we not better off with a GM in some form rather than no General Motors ? MAN Aren’t we ? </s>
Allan , Allan , are we not better off having some form of General Motors and people working there than no General Motors ? I’m with Eliot . We , what the country needs in a more general sense , not just confined to automobiles—what the country needs to do is think about the enormous debt that it owes to foreigners and how it’s going to pay them without bankrupting the country . </s>
And the only answer that exists is you have to export . We have to export . And in order to do that we have to invest . And the right program was an investment program , not a consumption program , not a bailout program . That was a mistake . </s>
Now , they want to say the administration was great in pushing this program . The administration made a mistake of letting the Congress write that program . So instead of writing in a program that the United States needs to solve its long term problem , the problems that you and I and everyone else are going to face for the next ten or twenty years , is how to handle that debt , how to get our exports up , how to get our consumption down—not how to get our consumption up . </s>
That was a fundamental mistake . The administration made that mistake . It should never have made that mistake because Larry Summers certainly should have known that the problem we’re going to have is how to finance that debt with more exports . And that’s going to require greater investment . And one of those investments is the kind of investment that Eliot was talking about . </s>
Okay , I want to come back to Mark . I want to come back to you but I want to ask you to hold for just a minute . We’re going to come back to Mark Zandi but I want to , at this point , get you ready to turn this over to you for questions . Reminding you of a couple of things . </s>
When the microphone , we have ushers with microphones . </s>
If you raise your hands and I spot you , I’ll signal that it’s for you . The microphone will come to you . I’m asking you to rise . </s>
If you’re a member of the news media we ask that you to identify yourself . </s>
And I want to remind you when you hold the microphone to hold it about one fist’s way , distance from your mouth so that we can hear you . And the last thing is please ask a question . We don’t want speeches and we are not asking you to debate with the debaters because we already have six and that’s even . Mark Zandi , to respond . Well , just a fact , one fact and then two responses . </s>
Just another statistic . Household net worth , that’s the value of all the things that we owe less all the things that we owe . This is our net worth . </s>
It declined by $ 15 trillion between the peak in ’07 Q3 through the bottom in ’08 Q4 . $ 15 trillion . And just to give you a context , there’s about $ 60 trillion worth , at the peak there was about $ 60 trillion in household net worth . Since the beginning of the year or since the administration’s inauguration , household net worth has risen by $ 5 trillion , $ 5 trillion . </s>
So that obviously reflects the improvement in the equity markets , stock prices—at least as measured by the S & P 500—are up . I didn’t look today but it’s up somewhere between 25 and 30 percent since he was brought into office . And housing values have started to rise . They fell sharply through the beginning of the year down 30 percent from the peak and now they’ve begun to rise . </s>
So to me that’s a very important statistic because that’s our net worth . Now , two quick responses , one with respect to the deficit . I think this is a legitimate concern . </s>
Obviously , it is a critical concern that we had a $ 1.4 trillion deficit , at 10 percent of GDP in fiscal year ’09 . And we’re going to run up a $ 1.2 trillion deficit at least in the current fiscal year . These are big numbers . But , you know , this was a Hobson’s choice for us . It really was no choice . </s>
If the policy makers did not respond aggressively to this and use the resources the economy would still be in recession , the financial system would be in disarray and the cost to taxpayers measurably greater , measurably greater . The deficits would be larger than they are . So we really had no choice in this . </s>
And I think , as well , the deficits are something that are the result of it . Now , finally , one other response . You know , in the efforts to shore up the financial system in the auto sector and other parts of the economy , we did get something . </s>
We got equity in a lot of these companies . And today GM said that they were going to begin repaying the loan that we made to them well before plan . And in fact , here’s a prediction . </s>
This is what I do for a living . I predict that at the end of the day we are going to get most of that money back , if not all of it , and in fact , many of the banks had repaid a lot of the loans , capital we took into the institutions and we’ve made money on that . So I think when this is all said and done and over and done with , the cost will be measurably greater . And that’s because we did get something when we did help them get through this period . </s>
Okay . MAN John , can I make just ... ? </s>
Uh , no , I actually want to go to questions at this point . Thank you . The man with the white card . It was a very good way to get my attention . </s>
It’s not going to work again . I saw somebody else use it last time I was here . First let me say thank you to the group in the front . </s>
Let me say thank you to the group in the audience . </s>
This is what New York City is all about . And the question I have for you is this : How long will it take to put solar energy on those buildings that are sitting in back of you ? How long will it take for the green economy to get moving ? How long will it take for us in America to get off the backs of oil and to do for ourselves ? How long will it take ? </s>
You’re the economists , you’re the predictors . I see it and where I’m at </s>
All right , let me ask you how you would phrase this question in terms of our motion . I’m coming back to you . How would you phrase this question , how would you relate this question to our motion , whether Obama’s economic policies are working effectively ? And if you can’t I’m going to have to pass . </s>
Well , I could do that , sir . </s>
And I’ll do it very quickly . My question is this : It takes a long time to get the ship out of the mud . As a sailor I know . We’re stuck in the mud here . </s>
How long do we feel it’ll take for the green economy to take effect ? </s>
Thank you . Good question . Jamie , Jamie Galbraith . One of the misfires at the start of this process was the idea that you could handle the problem with a stimulus package that would work in a relatively short period of time , over a year or two . </s>
It’s not going to work that way . In order to get out of this we are going to need to set a strategic direction for the economy and build institutions and programs capable of mounting a sustained effort over ten , fifteen , twenty years . And the direction that we need to take is clearly in the line that you just indicated , in the line dealing with our energy problem , dealing with climate change , creating green jobs so that people have work to do that is useful for the country . </s>
That was our institutional challenges that are on a par with the creation of the middle class in the New Deal in the post-war era . And it’s just nothing short of that . We need to be articulating , visualizing and acting on that scale and over that time frame , in my view . Larry Mishel , arguing for the motion . </s>
My buddy Steve . </s>
My buddy Larry . We’ve never agreed on anything before . No , I’m kidding— We’re not seeing that on the other team , exactly . </s>
Look , I want to wrap this back to this whole idea about cars and everything . The green economy is an important part of the future—but I think Jamie and I might even agree on this—but it is the longer term future . And the Obama Administration , I would argue , has all kinds of proposals that it is pushing vigorously to implement a green economy . </s>
But we are kidding ourselves if we think the green economy is the solution to our immediate economic problems . We are kidding ourselves if we think we could have let General Motors go bankrupt and built five hundred whatever it was that you said you wanted to build , in its place . </s>
And that would employ the million people who would have lost their jobs if General Motors had gotten— James Galbraith We’ve moved past that point to try and make a broader point in— But let me , let me Steve finish . Steve , were you finished ? </s>
Not quite . </s>
Okay . The Department of Energy , which was passed under the previous administration , actually , has a $ 25 billion loan program for advanced electrification of their -- new technology type of vehicles as a loan program . I will be curious to know if that’s the kind of program that Allan Meltzer would endorse as part of his belief in investment or whether he thinks that’s another government sort of give away boondoggle thing . </s>
Jamie Galbraith . </s>
I’ve made my point , go ahead . </s>
Oh , who was next ? I thought ... </s>
I believe— Allan Meltzer . ... the transformation of the economy is the right thing to do . And that’s what we should have done . But the mistake was to allow the Congress to enact a , what was largely a redistributive program instead of enacting a program which was in the long term interest to the United States . </s>
The United States is at a crucial point . We are facing a crisis . There’s a new book out that I commend to everybody . It isn’t my book so I can commend it . It’s by Reinhart and Rogoff . </s>
It traces crises since 1300 , especially since 1800 . I read the book and read the newspaper . It’s hard to know when you’re reading the book and when you’re reading the newspaper . Big debts , bailing out the banking system—we are headed for a crisis . </s>
So we have to use our resources more wisely . This is the twelfth recession in the post-war period . All the others we recovered from quickly . No one with any sense or knowledge believes we’re going to recover quickly from this one . That’s a failure of the policies that this administration has accepted from the Congress and is endorsing and pushing on you . </s>
Thank you . </s>
The woman in the fourth row . And Eliot , I see you champing at the bit to get in on this so I’m going to let you take this question if it’s relevant to you . </s>
But you must answer this question . The question is , at what point do we think the financial services and the whole banking system needs a reform ? Is the — At what point does it reform ? Does it need a reform ? </s>
And in that regard also another question . Once the government is no longer throwing money at the issues , what is going to happen ? There is a sentiment that next year could be a double dip . What is your Eliot , why don’t you take the first question ? </s>
Look , I don’t want to get into a prediction yet about a double dip . I think that on the other hand I will say this , that the data that we see is not encouraging in terms of spending . I know that if you take away cars from the current consumer spending today it was up .2 percent , inventories are down . All of those are negative data . </s>
Your first question , which is the fundamental one , which is how do we begin to reform the financial services sector ? that is where the fundamental disagreement that I have with the administration emerges . Because they have spent such an enormous amount of effort and capital rebuilding the same edifice . And those funds could have been used—Steve , this is where we disagree . </s>
Of course we needed to preserve General Motors but what we also needed to do was invest . And I agree , I think we , most of us would agree , that , yes , the deficit is a real issue . I would have done the energy investments . I would do more energy investments . Having said that , those funds could have been used to confront the mortgage crisis . </s>
Those funds could have been used to pay down some of the enormous mortgage overhang that is keeping consumers from being in a position to spend , from requiring the banks that received hundreds of billions of dollars in cash , trillions of dollars in loan guarantees , to step forward , to reform the mortgages . That would have a fundamental impact on the state of our economy in terms of consumer spending , home net worth and the net worth of the families that we are caring about . </s>
Instead , we simply gave the cash to these banks and where it is going is , to a great extent , proprietary trading , overseas investment—all of which is economically worthwhile for them but not for the totality of our gross domestic product . </s>
That is what we The , Eliot is saying that the policy has rebuilt the machine that broke once , rather than figuring out a new design for a machine . </s>
Well , the financial services industry wouldn’t agree with that . They’re fighting financial regulatory reform very strongly . </s>
They feel that these efforts aren’t in their best interest . So I don’t think they would agree with that position . And actually it is , well , quite substantive , the reform that is making its way through Congress . You know , there is a lot of debate but broadly speaking , a number of things are going to come out of this . </s>
First , the number of regulators that oversee the financial system will be rationalized . </s>
One of the problems we had in the previous regulatory structure was that there was just too many regulators and financial institutions could shop for the regulator or avoid regulation altogether . And so there is an effort to address that . There is also an effort to fashion a systemic risk regulator that can look across the entire financial scene . Another problem we had in this current financial crisis is that the Federal Reserve and the Treasury did not have the ability to quickly resolve cases like Lehman Brothers , which were not bank holding companies at the time . </s>
And then , third , also very important , the effort to establish a consumer financial protection agency . The idea is establishing an FDA for financial products because I think it’s clear from the crisis that many people who got loans really did not understand the loans that they were getting and that caused greater problems . So , and I’m quickly summarizing for you . But the scope of the reform— </s>
That was about two minutes , actually . ... is—Yeah , sorry—is very significant and the system will be very different at the other end of this . Let’s have—Sorry . Yes . </s>
Well , when we talk about— </s>
Allan , let me get to Allan Meltzer . ... the administration , this administration as trying to do something about the banking system , the financial system , is laughable . What they’re doing is putting it back where it was , only it’s bigger now because there have been more mergers . We have for thirty years , through various administrations , had too big to fail . </s>
Too big to fail is not something that just came with history . It came from the 1970s and it grew and grew and grew . Now what is too big to fail ? It is a system in which the bankers make the profits and you , the citizens , take the losses . That’s not a good system . </s>
The Federal Reserve— It’s not good for you and it’s not good for the country . And the reason is because it encourages risk taking , excessive risk taking , by some bankers -- not all bankers , but by some bankers . You— Steve Rattner , respond . And then we bailed 'em out . </s>
Steve Rattner , respond . </s>
One minute . </s>
So what you want to put into this thing— Allan , Allan . I just want to get some other voices into it . Steve Rattner , please . </s>
I’ll make a couple of very quick points . And I don’t want to be an apologist for the financial services industry , even though I spent twenty-six reasonably happy years in it . But let , but I was not at a TARP bank . I was not at Goldman Sachs . </s>
Let me just say a couple of quick things . First , to say that nobody in the financial system has suffered any pain , you should ask the people who worked at Lehman Brothers . </s>
You should ask the people who work at Citigroup , you should ask the people who worked at Wachovia , they— Most of them had huge amounts of their net worth in those firms . Ask people who didn’t get bonuses last year , Goldman Sachs is Goldman Sachs but a lot of people in the financial services industry took a lot of pain . </s>
The— But that isn’t the issue , it’s the public that’s taking the big loss . Well , no , no , no , no . No , that is not true , because as Mark just said , I think when the dust settles , I think you will find that the government actually did pretty well on a lot of these investments . Maybe not AIG , we can debate AIG . </s>
But the money they put into Goldman Sachs and into Morgan Stanley , first of all was involuntary , those banks didn’t even want the money , the government forced them to take the money because they didn’t want the weak banks to stand out , and a lot of them as Mark said have already repaid it . And let me just make one last point about too big—actually two last points , one about too big to fail . </s>
Too big to fail , you know , it’s not about repealing Glass-Steagall , it’s not about saying you can’t have more than this amount of assets . Many of you will remember LTCM , which went under in 1998 if I remember correctly , most people never heard of LTCM , it was probably not in the top 50 size of institutions and it almost brought down the entire financial system . I’m all for fixing these problems but let’s do it thoughtfully , not with a meat axe . Well , speaking— When— </s>
Let , let—Jamie , I stifled Jamie— When Allan said it was the public taking the losses , he didn’t mean the government budget . He meant the citizenry of the United States , they’re the ones who have taken the losses in this matter . </s>
As Mark Zandi already pointed out . The question here , is , again as Eliot has said , do we restore the existing banking system , or do we truly reform it . And that means having a system which is more competitive , better-run , easier to regulate , and led by a regulatory structure which is effective at monitoring and preventing the kinds of massive frauds , particularly in mortgage origination , and in the ratings process , and all through the process that led to this incredible disaster . That requires having enforcement mechanisms that work , and going after the perpetrators as was done , in the resolution of the savings and loan crisis , when , I should remind you , about 1,000 industry insiders were convicted of federal felonies and went to jail— </s>
Eliot—I wanted to bring the question so if you— Maybe I— —if you can give it brief . </s>
I…wholeheartedly agree with everything you just said , I would just add this point , we already have a systemic risk regulator , it’s called the Fed . They just didn’t do their job . The question shouldn’t be , do we need to pass a law— No , that’s not—that’s not true— </s>
It’s absolutely true— That’s not— Absolutely the case— </s>
Absolutely not true— The Fed had no— </s>
Well , you know what— The Fed— You ask—you ask them whether— The Fed—the Fed— —through their monetary policy— </s>
The Fed had no— </s>
—through the control of the access to the Fed window— The Fed had no— All right , all right , all right— I see—I think I see where you both feel about that , the woman in the second row ? </s>
Hi , this question is for— I think you might try again , please . </s>
It’s on now . </s>
This , okay , sorry . The question is for Steve Rattner . I would like you to comment on the status of the dollar today , please ? Why me— </s>
I think it’s off our point too much . Um… Gentlemen , two in , three in— ? </s>
Gray jacket . Hi , I hope I don’t ramble , I just thought about this , while you’re talking— You better not ramble . I’ll try to make this in two minutes and the past few days— </s>
But you’ve already used 19 seconds . Okay . We’ve talked about how there’s some systemic issues out there , we’ve talked about , you know , um , the finance instruments out there , the financial sector . </s>
We talked peripherally about how the American consumer is consuming too much and I think that’s pretty much a—I think that’s an issue that’s been going on for decades where the— Okay , sir , I—please get to a question— My question is that , do you think there is a systematic issue that has been built because of the inequality of wealth out there where the 1 percent , who , basically control the market , there has never been a capitalist market , it’s the 1 percent that controls the market , there’s no transparency , do you think , there’s a big issue because there’s been a massive… there’s a massive inequality in wealth distribution in this country and that’s going to create issues . Jamie Galbraith . It bears very closely to the question of ineffective economic policy . </s>
If you try to have the economy recovery by shoring up those few at the top it simply isn’t going to work , it didn’t work in 1929 , it’s not going to work now . What you have to do is to have a program which effectively provides employment , income , and security to the entire population of the United States . </s>
That’s where you need to begin . </s>
Going about it the other way is simply going about it backwards , and doomed not to succeed . Right , can I weigh in on this ? Yes , Larry Mishel . I absolutely think that the massive inequalities in our nation , were the precondition for the crisis that we’re in right now . </s>
And I believe that the Obama administration’s plans actually do address many of the issues , not all the issues going forward , to try to resolve that . Part of it is to develop a productive economy based on a non-carbon-based economy , part of it is to address changes in our basic labor markets , to have enforced labor laws and the basic wage and hours type things , to be able to restore the right to have unions , to raise the minimum wage . </s>
We are , they are also pursuing having universal health care , which is a mechanism for distributing income throughout the population , and security , and to try to do they can to try to get unemployment down as fast as they can which I think is in fact what the policy is . So I think that moving forward , building an economy where we’re not having growth based on asset bubbles and consumer debt , is really important , and that the only way to do that is to have wages growing in line with productivity , and to have more economic security , and I think that if Mr. McCain had been elected we would be nowhere on that agenda . With Mr. Obama , I think we’re around 75 percent on the right track towards that agenda— All right . </s>
Ma’am , I—you used the question about the dollar , and I think I was too abrupt , and I apologize . Was your question , looking at the dollar today , is it an indicator of his success , is that what you were getting at— Yes , exactly , that’s why I wanted one of the gentlemen on the panel on the left to answer— Well you’re back in , and I’m sorry— Okay— </s>
—about before… PANELIST Well , uh— Well , let me put in Mark Zandi , take that . </s>
Well , I think the decline in the dollar that we’ve observed recently over the last six to nine months is entirely appropriate , and actually it’s been very orderly . Entirely appropriate and a net positive for our economy , at least so far , that , yes , it has resulted in somewhat higher commodity prices in the one commodity that matters the most -- is the price of oil for all of us . But that negative has been offset by an increase in exports . </s>
A source of growth in our economy . It was a very significant negative back in the free fall , a year ago , nine months ago , but is now growing again in part because of the better global economy , in part because of the weaker dollar . Also it’s helped corporate profits , a lot of companies that operate overseas are benefiting from the dollar , so it’s a net positive , now , I do think if you look further out , and the dollar begins to decline in a disorderly way for whatever reason , that would be a problem , but so far , no problem , very good . James Galbraith . Very briefly , I’m not a deficit Cassandra , I’m not a public debt Cassandra and I’m not a dollar Cassandra . </s>
These issues are often used to make the argument that you simply can’t do what needs to be done in order to bring the economy back on track and overcome our unemployment crisis . And I don’t think they are valid objections . So from that point of view actually Mark and I don’t have an analytical difference , I would just simply say that the dollar will go where it’s going to go . It’s not going—the international monetary system will probably not collapse , and certainly not as the result of an effective effort to restore the American economy . Gentleman in the center ? </s>
Yes . </s>
I think very few people here would disagree that there’s more that should be done , in terms of correcting the systemic problems that exist in this country . </s>
The question before the group though , is whether Obama’s policies are working effectively . Which brings us back to the problem of dealing with Congress . Where you have many people , when you talk about , you know , making more green jobs , you have many people in Congress , far too many who deny that global warming is even a problem . </s>
We have people who are in Congress— I need you get to a question now . The question is , what would the panelists do , to try to implement the change that they’re talking about , dealing with the Congress we presently have . Steve—Steve Rattner , you described what passed is almost a miracle because of the Congress— because of Congress and because of— MAN I’m sorry , what was it— </s>
You described the fact that the stimulus package passed as— Yeah , it was almost a miracle— —as itself , a rare miracle . I think this is in all seriousness a huge issue for the country to think about , and , you know , there’s this great quote of Jefferson’s where he says if I had to choose between a government without newspapers or newspapers without a government , I would choose newspapers without a government . </s>
And I say that not because I’m advocating newspapers but , the whole concept when you get to Washington of realizing what Jefferson had in mind when he designed or was part of designing our system , the Capitol’s on the hill , the White House is down at the bottom . Article I of the Constitution is the Congress , it’s not the executive branch . The power that the Congress has is formidable and it was created in an era where we weren’t going to be dealing with toxic assets and we weren’t going to be dealing with regulatory reform , and we weren’t going to be dealing with green jobs , and it’s a real problem , I think as I’ve tried to argue that I think President Obama has done as effective a job as humanly possible in promoting a responsible agenda through Congress . But if you take something like reg reform—financial regulatory reform , not to use the jargon , it is mired in a series of intra-Congressional jurisdictional disputes over who would be in charge of this agency or that agency if you happen to pass something . </s>
It is a very broken system . Eliot Spitzer . Yeah , see Steve , we agree about the merits or demerits of legislative branches , I think we would agree on that point clearly . </s>
Having said that… Having said that , the question is what role does the executive play in defining the parameters of the debate . </s>
When it comes to regulatory reform as it relates to financial services , the President did not strike a position , did not articulate a position that said very clearly , here’s where we must go , which is what FDR did . FDR rewrote the rulebook , this President unfortunately embraced the existing rule structure , moved jurisdiction around marginally without saying the fundamental predicate of the issue , too big to fail , must shift . </s>
He hasn’t yet done . Let me switch gears since you raised the metaphor of Albany . </s>
When we went to Albany , I did in fact on health care , fundamentally go to war with the entrenched interests about how health care would be delivered . We had an enormous battle , and we bent that curve in a very significant way . You can do it , it’s a question of articulating , drawing lines in the sand , you won’t win everything . The President has been admirable in many respects , but when it came to financial services in particular , he did not embrace the fundamental change that was needed . There’s a gentle— Can you be brief , Allan ? </s>
Please . Very brief . </s>
Leadership consists of getting people to do the things that they don’t want to do . It doesn’t consist of blaming the Congress , and blaming past administrations , for problems that were there , when you came in . </s>
Gentleman with the yellow shirt in the dead center of the room . Larry touched on this earlier , it would seem to me that , if you’re talking about Obama’s policies , you have to talk about not only the legislation that has been passed , but what is proposed . Small bus—and that would be including health care which is being debated now . Cap-and-trade legislation , the expiration of the tax cuts , the Bush tax cuts , and labor law changes including , a card check , and…the way you would adjudicate disputes between labor and management . </s>
Small business is going to— Yeah , I need you to ask a question , sir . Does anybody think this is going to have any impact , the overhang of these things on the creation of jobs going forward ? The uncertainties created and the costs involved ? </s>
Larry Mishel . </s>
Well , I think that these kinds of policies are exactly what’s needed to build the economy we need to come out of this recovery . We need an economy which provides broadly shared prosperity , this is something that we haven’t had in 30 years . Prior to 2007 the prior 20 years or so , some 56 percent of all the income gains went to the upper 1 percent . That is not acceptable . It is also the predicate to the kind of crisis that we’ve had , because we can only have a robustly growing economy that’s sustainable if people are able to earn good wages and be able to spend based on those wages without going into debt or relying on asset bubbles . </s>
So I do think small business ideology says that these are not going to be good for them , but in fact it will be good for them , because it’s going to create a robust consumer economy that’s going to create a lot of different jobs , and that’s going to start benefiting everybody for once and for all . Jamie Galbraith . Well…I support health care reform , I support a strong energy and climate program , I support financial reform considerably stronger than the administration is proposing . I don’t think anybody argues , I don’t think the President argues , that those three things amount to an economic recovery program , sufficient to create let’s say three million jobs a year over five years , that’s not even close . </s>
That’s the issue that’s before us , have we done enough , are we doing enough to deal with the problem , that the population of the United States faces , answer to that question is , no . </s>
Eliott Spitzer— I would just add very quickly one footnote to that , it’s perhaps not a footnote , credit to small business is where we are stumbling most dramatically . You can not get loans if you’re a small business owner or entrepreneur . </s>
The reason for that is that all the capital went to the megabanks , and what they’re doing with it does not permit small businesses to grow . That is the egregious macro-error that the administration’s making . </s>
And the concludes Round 2 of our debate . And here’s where we are , we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater , two minutes each , and it’s their last chance to change your minds , and as we’ve said all along this is a debate of persuasion , you have been asked to vote before the debate began and you’ll be asked to vote again after the debate , the team that changes the most minds will be declared the winner and to remind you of the results of the preliminary vote , our motion is “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively , ” 32 percent of you are for this motion , 29 percent of you are against , and 39 percent are undecided . You’ll be asked to vote one more time , and that will decide our winner just a few minutes from now . But first , Round 3 , closing statements , we’re going to begin with Jamie Galbraith , James Galbraith , economist and professor of government and business relations at the University of Texas at Austin’s School of Public Affairs . Our side in this debate has presented an emphatic call for action . </s>
The other side has asked you to accept excuses . </s>
Excuses for the inadequacy of action so far . Maybe a little unfair but I know that tomorrow morning the Economic Policy Institute is going to issue with a broad coalition a major call for action . It’s exactly what we need , to deal with the gap in action today . </s>
Yes , the Congress is an obstacle . I worked for the Congress for 10 years , I know how difficult it can be . I was there though , in 1981 when Ronald Reagan rolled the Congress , and I would like to see once in my professional life , once in my life , for someone on our side to do the same . This is a dangerous moment . The cost of inadequacy is extremely high . </s>
If the program falls short , then the political situation , the political momentum , will be lost . </s>
If people see results for the bankers , and not for themselves… they see recovery in the stock market , but not in the value of their homes , they will turn away from all sensible measures . It will discredit everything the administration is in fact trying to do . </s>
Can you err by doing too much , the prospect is extremely remote and if you did you could always pull back . It’s exactly the kind of boldness that is needed , to confront the situation that we do not have yet and that we could only hope will develop in the next stage of policy of this administration . Thank you , James Galbraith . Summarizing for our motion , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively , ” summarizing for this motion , Mark Zandi , chief economist and co-founder of Moody’s Economy.com . Yeah , you know , to me , I think people lose sight of the severity of the situation that we’ve been in , the crisis that we’ve just gone through . </s>
The panic and the Great Recession , it truly , it is the longest deepest , broadest-based recession since the Great Depression , there’s no -- all the statistics are very clear on that . </s>
And I think the administration has been thrust into this , in the middle of it , and has been all about trying to bring an end to that crisis , to quell the crisis , to quell the panic , to bring an end to the Great Recession , and here we are , you know , nine months into this administration , and look . The panic has been quelled . We’re still nervous , we’re still cautious . </s>
We haven’t gotten our groove back . But , just think where we were , the Great Recession is over . The Great Recession is over , yes , it’s not fully engaged . Businesses went through near-death experiences , they’re not going to forget that and step out and start hiring immediately , you know . Policy isn’t magic . </s>
It’s not magic . But the recession is over and we’re moving in the right direction . </s>
Now . </s>
It’s fair to say that we need to do more . Absolutely . You know , but the proposition is , are the Obama administration’s economic policies working effectively , working . No one’s saying they’ve worked , that we’re done , that this is a work in progress , that the script hasn’t been written , and the administration as got a range of policies that it’s put forward , tough policies on difficult issues , things that we hadn’t been able to address , health care , financial regulatory reform , energy policy , tax reform , a budget deficit that’s been a problem for many , many years , and look , we’re starting to discuss it and that to me is proof positive that , they are working and we’re working in the right direction . Thank you . </s>
Good—thank you , Mark Zandi . </s>
Making his summary statement against the motion , Allan Meltzer , university professor of political economy at Carnegie Mellon . The subject is , are we… working , is this administration’s program working . </s>
The forecasts for the future , this is the 12th I think recession in the post-war years . We recovered from most of them . Most forecasts for the future say , the unemployment rate is going to stay up in the 10 to 11 percent range for a couple of years now . </s>
That’s not what I call working . The banking system , the financial structure , is unreformed . In addition to that , something we haven’t talked about , the administration has made threatening moves in the trade area . </s>
The World Trade Organization produced the greatest growth in world history , more people , in more countries , had their living standards raised by larger amounts in the post-war years , than at any time in mankind’s recorded history . </s>
They did that by reducing tariffs . The administration has increased tariffs on tires , steel pipes , next coming , coated papers , and other items . </s>
China is retaliating , by putting restrictions on auto imports . That’s a disaster . </s>
A bad policy . </s>
Not a policy that is going to produce growth in jobs and improvements in the United States . It’s a policy which is going to make the world poorer . And , summarizing for the motion , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively , ” Larry Mishel , president of the Economic Policy Institute . If the future is grim…and I agree with Allan Meltzer that in fact there is going to be persistently high unemployment , that’s unacceptable . Is that the Obama’s administration fault ? </s>
Is that the fault of the kind of policies that actually Allan himself and conservative allies have advocated for many different years . </s>
To my liberal friends… What— I’ve said that there was an apartment building on fire , and Eliot says , well maybe there were some fire trucks in the next county that could’ve actually helped put out the fire , in fact , I can tell you that he hasn’t named any other county which had the fire trucks , and what they would do , or said how they would get around the roadblock of the Republican moderates in the Senate that actually blocked an even more effective stimulus that was actually on the table . In my view , there’s been , and I have not been an Obama supporter from day one of that campaign , I’m far from in the bag for the Obama administration , I’m to the left of the Obama administration , okay ? I’ve been surprisingly pleased , much more pleased than I ever thought I would be by the direction of what they did with the recovery plan , much larger , well-designed in terms of putting out some money early that got things going . Some back-end public investments for energy alternatives , infrastructure , science , training , education , et cetera , I think very well-designed and smart . A lot of their other policies are directly on target , they’re trying to do big , bold things . </s>
I’m quite surprised and quite pleased , you should be as well . Summarizing against the motion , Eliot Spitzer , former governor and Attorney General of New York . Well first of all , thank you all , this has been spirited fun and we probably disagree less than some of the rhetoric tonight would suggest but let me say this , I’m tired of hearing blame pushed to Republicans in Congress . </s>
We as Democrats have a majority in both houses , it’s about time we used them . </s>
It’s about time we stood up and used our majority . </s>
It can be done , and we should do it . Let me tell you where the fire trucks are , the fire trucks are the billions , hundreds of billions of dollars that were given to the wrong banks for the wrong reasons , that were not used to invest in the infrastructure , to invest in jobs , in mortgage reformation . That could’ve had a fundamental effect on our economy and that’s what we should have done . </s>
The fire trucks take the form of not demanding reform of those who received the money . Not making them pay for the benefit of receiving tax dollars in return for a reformed regulatory structure , and the fire trucks take the form of not investing in jobs for the future . I am worried , I think Mark is exactly right . </s>
Some of the nervousness is gone . The nervousness is gone primarily because of what the Bush administration did , pushing a lot of money to the banks . </s>
That wasn’t the Obama administration . But precisely because the nervousness is gone , the moment for the fundamental reform we need is passing . And rather than galvanize that urge for reform , rather than push for the fundamental reform that we need in terms of jobs , investing in education , investing in health care , driving up the average wages of workers , the administration is reinvesting in the status quo , primarily a financial services sector , based upon the incorrect but maybe it’s a benign interpretation , the incorrect belief that putting the money there will generate the jobs . As I said , those manufacturing jobs will not come back , General Motors today said , they don’t anticipate hiring more workers in the United States . </s>
Overseas they will . So yes , Steve , we agree , we needed a bailout , but that’s not where jobs are coming from , jobs will come from small-medium business , banks should lend to them but the banks that would lend to them don’t have the capital , because all the capital went to the megabanks that are not going to lend to them anyway . That was the critical mistake . Thank you all for being here . </s>
Finally summarizing for the motion , Steve Rattner , who led the administration’s efforts to restructure the auto industry . So Eliot , let me see if I have this right , the mistake we made was quenching the fires of financial crisis which took away the urgency to do anything about it so we should restore the financial crisis so there is some desire to do something about it , is that right ? </s>
Use it properly . A crisis is a terrible thing to waste— My— Wait a minute , wait a minute , I— </s>
That is really against the rules— This is my chance to— </s>
There is two minutes— </s>
—to have a last word without you saying anything . So I want to say that the only systemic authority that the federal reserve would’ve had to bail out Lehman Brothers , would’ve been to bail out Lehman Brothers exactly what you don’t want to have happen , so there was no authority to deal with Lehman Brothers . </s>
One more comment to you before I leave you alone for a second , this idea that we have—and to Jamie as well—the idea we have a majority in Congress , yes , we have a majority in Congress , it is very much in name only . We created , our political leaders , a big tent in order to have those majorities . That tent spans a lot of ideologies and it is very difficult to marshal majorities let alone the 60 votes you need in the Senate where there are two independents , to get something done , and you guys make it sound easy , it is not , it is not easy , you make everything sound easy , you tell us— You know , just wave your magic wand and you’ll have financial regulatory reform , it’s not that easy . You’ve also set up a false dichotomy , you’ve said that , you’ve raised this question of whether or not we should have more action , of course we should have more action , we all agree that we should have more action . </s>
The question is , what is responsible , how do you get it done , and what makes good sense . And I would argue what I said before , I won’t repeat it all , that this administration’s put forward responsible policies in every area . </s>
Is financial regulatory reform is it what I would do or what Eliot would do , left to our own designs , no . But is it something that they spent a lot of time vetting with Congress people to try to come up with something that had a change of passage so that we would actually get something done as opposed to getting nothing done , it’s back to Larry’s don’t let the perfect be the enemy of the good . </s>
They did , and they have something out there , they have walked the walk , they’ve talked the talk . And what I frankly have heard tonight from the other panel , is , let’s just go do it and let’s pretend we’re at the Aspen Institute or the Brookings Institution , it’s just not how it works . And , that concludes closing statements for this debate . And now it’s time to learn which side argued best , who are our winners , we’re going to ask you one final time to go to the keypad on your seat , and vote . </s>
Press 1 if you are for the motion…2 if you are against , and 3 if you are undecided , our motion , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively , ” and we get the results very quickly , they’ll be here instantaneously , just a couple of things . Our winner tonight of Quote of the Night , Mark Zandi , “Policy is not magic.” </s>
Congratulations to you . Just the yawner . </s>
Just the yawner . </s>
I want to thank—I really do want to thank the audience , and especially our panelists for a very spirited debate if we could give them a round of applause . Our next debate will be Tuesday , December 1st , our motion is “America is to Blame for Mexico’s Drug War.” Panelists for the motion are Andrés Martinez , he’s director of the New America Foundation’s Bernard L. Schwartz Fellows Program , Jeffrey Miron , a senior lecturer and Director of Undergraduate Studies in the Department of Economics at Harvard , and Fareed Zakaria , editor of Newsweek International . Against the motion , Jorge Castañeda , the former Foreign Minister of Mexico , Chris Cox , the Executive Director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action , and Asa Hutchison , a former Congressman and administrator of the DEA . Tickets are still available for this on our website and at the box office here at the Skirball Center . </s>
All of our debates will continue to be heard on more than 200 NPR stations , and that number is growing all of the time , across the country . You can also watch these fall debates on the Bloomberg Television Network , and you can check for airdates and times in your local directory . Do not forget , you can read about today’s debate in next week’s edition of Newsweek , and there’re copies in the lobby that you can pick up on your way out . </s>
All right , it’s in now , I have been given the final results . And I want to ask you as I read the final results , I’ll raise my hand as a gesture to you to please applaud for the radio audience . Remember the team that changes the most minds here is declared the victor and here’s how it breaks down , before the debate , our motion , “Obama’s Economic Policies Are Working Effectively , ” 32 percent were for the motion , 29 percent were against , and 39 percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , 46 percent are for the motion , 42 percent against , 12 percent undecided , the side for the motion wins , our congratulations to them , and to everyone who took part , from me , John Donvan . </s>
Goodbye from Intelligence Squared US . And Intelligence Squared only exists because of the foundation , the Rosenkranz Foundation which is making all of this possible . And I would like to introduce , to set the stage for the debate , the chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Thank you very much . My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate . </s>
And tonight 's concerns , obviously , Obama 's jobs plan . Congress should approve Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece , since the whole thing is no longer at issue in the Senate . The U.S. economy is cruelly stagnating . Unemployment is stubbornly above nine percent . </s>
And we risk a serious contraction if Europe fails to deal effectively with its own debt crisis . While we do need to address the federal government 's fiscal position in the medium term , the short term need is for government to encourage jobs creation . </s>
President Obama 's plan does target the short term , specifically fiscal 2012 , with a variety of measures . These include an extension of the payroll tax holiday for employers which is currently in effect . This is Economics 101 . By decreasing the cost of labor , the payroll tax holiday encourages business to do more hiring . Another element of the plan is infrastructure spending , putting construction labor back to work for needed improvements to our roads , bridges , airports and the like . </s>
The plan will create 1.9 million jobs next year and add nearly two percent to national output . </s>
Where is a counter argument ? It 's that the proposal simply repeats the failed policies of the past , naively hoping for a different result this time . At nearly half a trillion dollars , the plan adds around 40 percent to the already staggering trillion dollar deficit projected for next year . </s>
Even accepting administration claims at face value , it amounts to nearly a quarter of a million dollars in deficit spending to put a single worker in a job for one year . Moreover , it 's arguable that the extra jobs will not materialize at all because the bill is rife with regulatory provisions that favor unions and discourage employers . </s>
Both sides of the debate will acknowledge that for the economy to grow , consumers must have the confidence to spend , and businesses must have the confidence to invest and to hire . Will the passage of President Obama 's proposals restore confidence that our government is capable of decisive action and is doing the right thing to jump start the economy ? Or will it destroy confidence by portending higher deficits , higher taxes , higher inflation and a bigger regulatory burden in the years ahead . The decision is yours . </s>
And we 've assembled here an extraordinary panel of experts to help you decide . It 's my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator , John Donvan . Thank you . Thank you . And I 'd just like to invite one more round of applause to Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible . </s>
True or false , Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece ? That 's what we 're here to debate , another verbal joust from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We 're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . </s>
Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece . </s>
Two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides , one for it and one against it . And only one team will win . </s>
And you , our audience here at the Skirball Center , a packed house , will decide the winner . Let 's meet our debaters . Arguing for this motion that Congress should pass the jobs plan piece by piece , a former economic advisor to President Obama and a professor at Princeton University , Cecilia Rouse . Her partner is one of the nation 's most prominent economic forecasters , chief economist of Moody 's analytics , Mark Zandi . </s>
Putting the `` Not '' in the proposition , Congress should not pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece , this team includes an influential thinker in legal academia , a professor here at New York University 's school of law , Richard Epstein . And his partner is a libertarian economist who focuses on tax reform and policy . He 's a senior fellow at the Cato Institute , Daniel Mitchell . Now , this is the debate . One side will win , and one side will lose . </s>
And you , our live audience , will pick the winners . By the time the debate has ended , you will have been asked to vote twice , once before the debate and once again afterwards . </s>
And the team that has changed the most minds will be declared the winner . So let 's now establish the baseline . </s>
We 're going to go to the preliminary vote . If you go to those key pads at your seat , the way that it works , there are a lot of buttons on it . </s>
Pay attention to numbers one , two and three . If you agree at this point with this motion that Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece , push number one . If you are against this motion , push number two . And if you are undecided , push number three . You can ignore the other keys . </s>
And if you feel that you made an error , just correct it , and the system will lock in the last vote . So as the end of the debate , we will reveal this number that we 're registering now and the second number . And by that , you will pick our winner . Okay . So we go in three rounds . </s>
And round one , opening statements by each debater in turn . Our motion is , `` Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece . '' And here to argue for that motion , Mark Zandi . </s>
He is chief economist of Moody 's Analytics where he directs research and consulting . He is cofounder of economy.com and the author of the book `` Financial Shock . '' </s>
He is also interestingly enough , Mark , I notice that on the White House blog where they are defending this plan , they cite , when they talk about independent points of view , Mark Zandi . </s>
Well , I must be right then . Well , it would be very interesting to see you agree with yourself tonight . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Mark Zandi . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , John , thank you Intelligence Squared for the opportunity to be here . And it is certainly an honor to be here with such a thoughtful group of individuals . It 's an honor to be here . I 'm going to make four points in my opening remarks . Point number one is that I think there are a number of different reasons for why the Obama jobs plan should be passed . </s>
I 'm not going to go through all of them . Cece 's going to go through some of her reasoning . But for me the key thing is we need to avoid going back into a recession . </s>
And the jobs plan is instrumental in ensuring that we do n't . The economy is obviously struggling . </s>
This is very obvious by looking at the job market . If you take a look at the jobs data over the last few months , we 've been getting job growth that 's close to 75,000 per month on average . Just for context , we need almost double that to maintain a stable rate of unemployment . </s>
And unemployment is already 9.1 percent and thus threatens to higher . </s>
This is a rather dramatic reversal of fortune from where we were at the start of the year . I mean , it 's hard to remember back , but just think about January , February , March , April . We were creating a couple hundred thousand jobs per month . And I was quite optimistic about the economy 's prospects . </s>
But we got nailed by a number of what I call unfortunate events . In fact , John , I say they 're unpredictable , largely because I did n't predict them . Higher energy prices due in part to the Arab Spring and the Libyan conflict , and even with the declining energy prices more recently , we 're going to spend about a hundred , 125 billion more on gasoline this year than last . And by the way , that 's roughly equal to the payroll tax holiday that we got this year . So we literally took our tax cut , and we put it into our gas tank . </s>
It did n't provide the juice that we were hoping for , but I think it forced all the recession , very helpful . The Japanese quake , very hard on manufacturing , which has been a key source of growth . But I think the key thing that did us in this year was a series of what I consider very egregious policy errors . Most obvious being the spectacle over the debt ceiling debate . I think that just completely eviscerated confidence , undermined sentiment . </s>
It 's not that people are pulling back yet . It 's not that businesses are increasing their layoffs . But they certainly have stopped hiring , and that 's why we 're in the predicament that we 're in . I do think that if policy makers do nothing , just sit on their hands and do nothing , the odds of recession are very serious . In fact , I think they 're better than even . </s>
Because in current policy , under current law , there is significant fiscal restraint , meaning that given some of the tax cuts that expire , given some of the spending increases that fade away , a federal fiscal policy will cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth . </s>
GDP is the value of all the things that we produce . They 'll cut 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth next year , and if you throw in the cuts at state and local government , it 's almost a couple percentage points . </s>
The good economy , a solid economy that 's growing strongly would have trouble digesting that kind of restraint . A weak economy , the economy that we 're in today , I think would be pushed into recession . So we 've got to make some policy changes to ensure that , that fiscal drag is less significant than it is currently . </s>
Point number two , I think the fiscal stimulus that has been implemented to date has been effective . I think it succeeded . The purpose of physical stimulus is not to provide a source of long term economic growth . It 's about ending the recession . In fact , the Recovery Act -- this is the stimulus that most people are focused on , the $ 850 billion package that was implemented at the start of the Obama administration , succeeded in ending the great recession just -- a few days . </s>
The Recovery Act was passed in mid-late February '09 . And by the way , in February '09 we lost 750,000 jobs . The economy was in freefall . By June the economy was growing again , GDP , again , the value of all the things that we produce was increasing , the recession was over by February 2010 , one year later . </s>
We were creating jobs . </s>
And over the past year and a half since February 2010 , we 've created well over two million jobs . It 's not good enough but in the -- I think the counterfactual is here -- here is a much more serious recession . In my view , we would 've suffered a depression . </s>
The stimulus efforts were very successful in ending the great recession , jump starting an economic recovery . Third point -- did I tell you how many points I was going to make ? Audience : Four . Four . </s>
The third point -- just testing , making sure you 're paying attention -- -- third point is that the Obama plan is pretty well structured , 450 billion over two years , 250 billion of which approximately are temporary tax cuts , another 200 billion in temporary spending increases . You know , not all of the pieces of the package are made equal . In my view , the most important element of the plan is the extension of the payroll tax holiday for workers . </s>
If we do not extend that , taxes for everyone will rise on January 1 , 2012 , and again , given this economy , that would be a very significant problem . There are elements of the plan that are really quite creative , some of which Cece has worked on with respect to providing incentives for employers to go out and hire people . There are reforms to the unemployment insurance system that I think has wide bipartisan support , and there 's some really creative elements with respect to infrastructure spending and infrastructure banks to try to get private capital married with public money to go out and invest in our much depleted infrastructure , and the most important thing you should know , it is all paid for . This is not a deficit of finance . It will be paid for by -- at this point , the discussion is to have a tax surcharge on people who make a million dollars a year . </s>
Now , that 's a negative . I do n't like raising taxes on anybody , but I think that 's a modest negative in the context of , again , not going back into recession . And finally , point number four , this is very important , the jobs bill is only one part of what policymakers need to do to get this economy on the right track . </s>
We also need long term economic policy , but we have -- Congress and the administrative have to follow through on the debt ceiling deal , and we need tax reform . So we need to reduce the tax expenditures in the tax code , make it fairer , less complex , and put our businesses on solid ground . So this is only the start of what we need to do . </s>
It 's not the end . I want to thank you very much for your kind attention . We just ca n't go back into recession . Obama 's job plan will ensure that we do n't . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Mark Zandi . </s>
Our motion is `` Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece , '' and here to speak first against the motion , Daniel Mitchell . He is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute where he focuses on tax reform and supplied side tax policy . In his past , he was an economist for Senator Bob Packwood and the Senate Finance Committee . And , Dan , you do these videos online that I 've seen where you explain economics to the masses . </s>
I want to compliment you on your delivery -- Thank you . -- as from inside the business . </s>
It 's excellent . I was taken with your discussion of government spending in which you said that in the end you feel that the real reason that government spending happens , you say , `` I suspect it 's because politicians just love spending other people 's money , '' but you worked for a politician ? </s>
Yes , but I 've reformed . You -- okay . Ladies and gentlemen , Daniel Mitchell . </s>
Thank you very much . It’s a real honor to be here , especially with such a distinguished group of co-panelists . As a matter of fact , I think what am I doing here ? I’m sort of like the SAT answer , one of these things is not like the other . But hopefully , since I am representing the Cato Institute , I want to give people a very good impression about what libertarian philosophy of left government and individual freedom is all about . </s>
And the way Richard and I are going to divide up our responsibility , I’m going to look at sort of the macro issues of stimulus and Keynesianism and Obama’s Jobs Act . And he’s going to look at some of the nitty gritty details . That of course enables me to do the easy part and him to do the hard part . And I want to divide my part up , the macro part looking first at the theory and then at the evidence . </s>
Now Keynesians say that whenever the economy’s weak , the government should borrow money , spend the money , or give tax rebates or tax relief in some form or fashion . The goal of both the spending and the tax relief is to put money in people’s pockets so people will go out and spend the money and sort of jump start the economy . And that sounds very plausible . It makes sense . We’re all going to have money in our pockets . </s>
We’re going to go out and spend money . That has to do something good for the economy . </s>
There’s only one little problem with the theory . Where does the government get the money ? Government can print money . </s>
Government can borrow money . Government can tax money . But there’s no way the government can put money into the economy without first in some form or fashion taking money out of the economy . And what is it that we’re trying to do ? </s>
What is a recession ? </s>
A recession means that our GDP , which used to be this much , is now this much . This by the way is a West Virginia PowerPoint slide here . </s>
What is it that we want to do ? </s>
What is economic growth ? Economic growth means we’re going to take this GDP and we want it to be higher . But what is Keynesianism ? </s>
What is stimulus at least as it’s defined inside Washington ? Stimulus inside Washington is well let’s money from the economy’s right pocket and put it in the economy’s left pocket . </s>
But are we doing anything to increase this blob called GDP ? No , we’re not . My contention is that what Keynesianism does is it redistributes national income , usually in ways that politicians find attractive because they can try to become Santa Claus and buy votes , but our goal should be not to redistribute national income ; we want to increase national income . We want a bigger pie so everyone can get a bigger slice , that’s what economic growth is all about . </s>
Let me give you an example that I think makes this clear . This is actually a quiz . It’s not like the thing where you get to vote twice . By the way , if you let them vote five times , you could rename this Chicago . </s>
Here’s a little quiz that will determine whether or not you’re qualified to be a member of Congress . Let’s divide this room in half . </s>
Let’s borrow all the money out of the pockets of the people on this side of the room and give it to the people on this side of the room . Now here’s the quiz . Raise your hand if you think there’s more money in the room . I’m sorry , none of you are allowed to be in Washington because you have failed your elementary test on Keynesian economics . And if you look at what’s happened . </s>
If you look at the evidence for Keynesian economics , for stimulus , whatever you want to call it , what do we find ? I don’t think we find very good results . You can go back to the 1930s , Hoover and Roosevelt were both Keynesians . </s>
Hoover increased government spending by 47 percent in just four years , that was a period of deflation so it was actually more than 50 percent in real terms . The economy didn’t do any better . Roosevelt in eight years , from 32 to 40 , increased government spending by more than 100 percent . Unemployment stayed high , the economy stayed in recession . </s>
Now , let me give a little bit of humility , first , on behalf of all economists . If you ask five economists a question , you’ll get nine answers . We have correctly predicted 14 of the last three recessions . We’re not very good at these things . And especially when you’re looking at something like the overall macro economy . </s>
There’s trade policy , there’s regulatory policy , there’s labor policy , monetary policy . There are all of these different things going on in the economy , not to mention some of the exogenous factors that Mark talked about . </s>
Earthquakes , hurricanes , tsunamis , oil price shocks , you name it . And now we’re expecting to look at one little slice of all of these different policy levers , fiscal policy , and we’re supposed to make sweeping judgments about what exactly it means . </s>
Of course at best all we’re really doing is guessing . </s>
But if you look at those periods in time when you did have politicians like Hoover and Roosevelt increasing government spending , it doesn’t seem to have worked . </s>
But it’s not just the 1930s . Gerald Ford had a Keynesian tax rebate package in the 1970s . It did n't work . </s>
Japan has had , by some accounts , 16 different stimulus packages since their economy entered the doldrums in the 1990s . Those have n't worked . </s>
Bush had a Keynesian stimulus package in 2008 . It did n't work . And then , of course , Obama more recently has done the same thing . And time after time after time we do n't seem to be getting very good results . </s>
Now , I 'm not up here to make partisan points at all . What I think of policies that have not worked very well , you 'll notice that I 've listed Republican administrations and Democratic administrations . But if you ask me what should happened , if you ask me for the success story , I look at things such as the Clinton years and the Reagan years . </s>
And this should make Cecilia happy because she worked for the Clinton administration before working for the Obama administration . She did a good job her first time around . Her second time , maybe not so much . </s>
But if you look at what happened during the Reagan years and the Clinton years , and you look at these broad measures of economic freedom such as the Frazier Institute , economic freedom of the world index or my old employers at the Heritage Foundation , their economic freedom of the world index , or the world economic forum 's global competitiveness report , you will see that during the Reagan years , during the Clinton years , you had more economic liberalization , more freedom , a reduced burden of government spending . And that 's why I think we got better economic results during those periods . Now , I 'm running out of time , so let me go ahead and say something about what should happen , because obviously I 'm up here trying to convince you to vote against the motion . </s>
In some sense , politicians should follow the Hippocratic Oath . First , do no harm . And I do worry that when politicians , especially driven by that short- term time horizon of trying to get reelected and wanting to send out press releases , oh , we 're doing something . </s>
They want to show that , oh , we care . You know , what was that , the first President Bush went up to New Hampshire in '92 , message , `` I care . '' </s>
I mean , boy , talk about an empty , vacuous statement to make . But that 's how most politicians think . </s>
They really are driven by this desire to try to demonstrate to voters that they really are concerned about your best interests , when in reality , in many cases , at least part of their decision making is driven by their desire to get more votes . So I do n't want -- Daniel Mitchell , your time up . Thank you very much . Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you . </s>
So here 's where we are . We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . And we have four debaters , two teams of two arguing out this motion : `` Congress should pass Obama 's job plan piece by piece . '' You 've heard the first two debaters and now onto the third . Arguing for the motion , I 'd like to introduce Cecilia Rouse . She 's a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University 's Woodrow Wilson School . </s>
From 2009 to 2011 , she was on the inside . She served as a member of the president 's Council of Economic Advisors . And Cecilia , I want to ask you about Thanksgiving at your house , because I understand you have a physicist father and a physicist brother , and you 're an economist and three PhDs . Maybe there 's a fourth one in the family somewhere . So what , do you talk numbers and formula all through -- </s>
Actually , there is a fourth PhD , my sister who is also a professor at Princeton , actually . But she 's in anthropology . So Dan Hamermesh who is a professor of economics at Texas , says , let me think . Your father was a theoretical physicist . </s>
Your brother 's an experimental physicist . You 're an economist , and your sister 's an anthropologist . You 're getting weaker as you go . Ladies and gentlemen , Cecilia Rouse . Thank you . </s>
It really is a pleasure to be here tonight . </s>
And , you know , Dan really said it right when you said you have five economists , you really only get nine opinions . I think you get many more . </s>
I was in the Clinton administration . Those were good years in the '90s . </s>
I think many people might interpret those times , though as that the Federal Reserve , because we were having a lot of economic growth , and the Federal Reserve was not anywhere near having interest rates which were so near to zero , that monetary policy -- the Federal Reserve was actually responsible for a lot of that growth . In contrast , what we have today is , specifically , a Fed that can not do as much as it normally can in normal times . </s>
Interest rates are near zero . It 's near zero , lower bound . You ca n't have negative interest rates , and therefore it 's an opportune time to have more fiscal policy . But my debate partner talked about some of these bigger pictures . I 'm a labor economist . </s>
I got into economics because I was worried about the unemployed , and I still am . There are 14 million workers in the United States who are unemployed . </s>
Half of them have been unemployed for more than six months . There are another two and a half million who are discouraged , meaning that they 've even given up looking . And there 's about nine million who are working part time , but who would actually like to work full time . So they 're working part time for economic reasons . We 've had 19 straight months of private sector employment growth . </s>
But we 've also had many months where the public sector has had negative employment growth . And as a result , we have a recovery , but it 's a recovery with a small R. It 's just fledgling . And as Mark pointed out I 'm also very concerned that this recovery is just not far enough along . Now , there 're huge challenges that this entire downturn is going to pose for us going forward . </s>
When workers become displaced , they do not earn -- they have , going forward , for 15 , 20 years , they 're going to earn much less , by some estimates , 10 to 15 , 20 percent less than they were earning before their displacement . </s>
It has impact on their children . Their children get lower levels of schooling going forward . It is going to affect the earnings of their children . And look at all of the young people today who are finishing their schooling and ca n't get a job , meaning they 're not even getting started into the labor force . </s>
So we know that these have the potential to really hold back economic growth going forward . So yes , I support the Obama plan . I support any plan where it 's going to provide some sort of short-term insurance against another double-dip recession or having more downturn . Now look , last year , I was at the Council of Economic Advisors . </s>
And things were looking a lot better . And as a result , if you listened to the president 's State of the Union , what he proposed in his budget were investments that were not towards stimulus , but were really towards the foundations of growth , in infrastructure and education , in innovation . And I believe that they are very important . And we all believe that . </s>
But we do n't have the economy today that we had just six , nine months ago . </s>
And therefore , I think the time is right for Congress to act . </s>
Now , let 's first talk about the pillars of what -- the major components of this plan and what it would do . So first of all , about 40 percent of it is putting money in the hands of individuals . Okay . Some people may say , well , look , that 's putting money in their pockets . </s>
They 're not doing much . But let 's talk about it . So the tax cut was providing about $ 1,500 a year in tax cuts for those who are earned about $ 50,000 a year , which is about what the median family earns , I should say . </s>
It was about $ 2,500 for those earning $ 80,000 or more . It continues the federally funded unemployment insurance benefits . Now , let 's talk about that . Six million workers will lose those unemployment insurance benefits . They lost their job through no fault of their own . </s>
These benefits are not helping them live high on the hog . It 's only replacing about half of their wages , which means they 're getting a check of about $ 320 a week . </s>
And we know that that 's about a third of the family income . It helps them to pay their mortgage or pay their rent , helps them put food on the table . It helps them to support their local businesses , et cetera . And that 's the way in which it helps to support the economy . The Congressional Budget Office has said that these sorts of benefits are one of the fastest and most effective ways in which to help our economy in the short term . </s>
Important we can talk more about this . I know many believe that this is not the time to continue -- to continue these sorts of benefits . And I would argue this is exactly the time to do so . It also -- let 's face it , the private sector is the most important source of job growth in this country . </s>
They provide 80 percent of the jobs . So another part of this is -- this is not about trying to create a gigantic public sector jobs program . </s>
It 's about trying to stand up the private sector . So another 20 percent or so are ways to try to cut the cost for businesses to do their business . So I teach microeconomics . </s>
Firms do business by having labor and capital . I hope that 's as geeky as I get tonight . And there are ways to cut their investments for next year and as well as lowering costs of hiring workers . </s>
Again , it extends the payroll tax cut not just to the employee but to the employer now . And it also provides an extra incentive for firms to bring on more workers . And lastly , as I mentioned before -- all of those should help in the next year . But we know we 're going to be in this for a little while . It takes a while to recover from downturns that are caused by crises in the financial sector . </s>
And so 20 percent of it is also directed towards infrastructure , which again we think is actually one of the pillars of economic growth . Now , as Mark mentioned , there are some innovations in the way some of this money would be spent . In terms of the unemployment insurance benefit , there are some encouraging states to provide more employment , reemployment assistance to workers . There is encouraging states to stand up programs where firms do n't have to choose between laying off workers and keeping some -- they can share the pain , if you will , for a temporary downturn , through work sharing . It encourages entrepreneurship by encouraging states , some of which already have them , including my own state of New Jersey -- help making it easier for aspiring entrepreneurs who are unemployed to be able to start their business while they 're receiving these unemployment insurance benefits which they currently are not technically allowed to do . </s>
And it also starts an infrastructure bank which is a creative way of trying to bring private money into trying to foster some of these public projects for which normally the private sector does n't receive enough of a return in order to do . So I think that it 's a balanced package , and I think it hits a lot of the right parts . As Mark mentioned , it 's paid for . </s>
We can talk more about the way it 's paid for . You know , the current idea on the table is Senator Reid proposing a 5.6 percent tax on those whose adjusted gross income is more than a million dollars , that 's about .03 </s>
percent of American taxpayers . So , in closing , yes , I support a program that will provide support to this economy today because I am very worried about how families are getting by . </s>
We have 46 million families living in poverty . I 'm worried that our recovery is fragile . This does n't mean that we do n't need longer term strategies to have more robust growth going forward , but I just do n't happen to believe that these are n't mutually exclusive . Maybe hope springs eternal , but I think that Congress can walk and chew gum at the same time , thank you . </s>
Thank you , Cecilia Rouse . </s>
Our motion is `` Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece , '' and now here to speak against the motion , I 'd like to introduce Richard Epstein . He 's a professor of law here at New York University Law School , a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution , and a professor of law emeritus and senior lecturer at the University of Chicago where , interestingly enough , given the context , a colleague you used to bump into in the hallways , an adjunct professor was named Barack Obama -- Yes , he was -- </s>
And I understand you knew him a little bit , and you 're quoted as saying that you found him to be an amazingly talented intellectual -- amazingly talented at playing intellectual poker , which , to me , sounds pretty cool . It 's very cool . It was very difficult to read the man , and that 's why it was that he was such a great poker player . But the question is not whether he could play poker , it 's whether or not the statute that he proposes is one that will do the things that we want it to do . And in this debate , there is no disagreement over the sad state of the American economy and the need for something to be done . </s>
The question is how it should be done , what should be done , and why . And I 'm a lawyer , and I 'm with three economists , and I have at least one comparative advantage or disadvantage as the case may be , I actually spent time reading the statute to see what it says in order to figure out whether or not the pieces make any sense . And it 's interesting that you can talk about this at the macro level , but it 's also extremely important to talk about it at the micro level , and so let me tell you some of the pieces which I think are positively self destructive and ought never to see the light of day . One of the truly misguided features of the stimulus program of 2009 was the passage of ARRA , the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , which instituted a whole variety of buy American provisions in the bill with respect to those funds which were to be distributed through the government to various kinds of employees . </s>
If you look at the kinds of provisions that are created there , it 's a massive bureaucracy which is designed to ensure that the money which is so distributed will be largely wasted . It is the kind of thing which says that you can not buy from sensible foreign providers if they are expensive and inefficient American providers , then there are huge amounts of administrative discretion as to when these particular requirements will be relaxed . </s>
The whole thing in effect will take a large portion of the stimulus program , and it will turn it into a waste . A similar provision is a re-incantation of one of the worst pieces of Hoover 's legislation , the Davis-Bacon Act , saying that when the government gives this kind of money out , you have to pay prevailing i.e . union wages with respect to the money in question . So the stimulus program seems to say , `` The way in which you get the most for your money is to spend as much as you can on labor rather than as little as you can , '' and there 's no way that this kind of monopoly waste can possibly improve the situation with respect to the legislation in question . </s>
A third feature of the bill is to introduce a new form of an anti-discrimination act which says that you can not discriminate against people who are unemployed when you decide whom to hire . That of course is an extremely complicated provision . It has about four separate pages to it , and there 's an exception which says that , `` Yes , you can take into account their job record under these circumstances . '' So any employer who now wants to go out into the labor market has to worry about the question when they hire from other places that they may be running -- exposing themselves to either government liability or to private lawsuits . </s>
But of course this does nothing to improve aggregate hiring because if you hire somebody who 's already employed , that opens up a position for somebody else . So what you have to understand is at these particular levels , all of the micromanagement is counterproductive to the macroeconomic goal that is in question . Then the next thing that we 've heard about , and was praised mightily , was the payroll reduction tax for a single year , and what happens is we know what 's wrong with this tax because we 've been told so by our opponents in this case . Employers are not people who are foolish . They understand that if they want to hire somebody for the long run , they do n't only look at this year 's rates , they look at next year 's rates as well . </s>
Our objective with respect to tax policy is to create some kind of a sustainable system of growth . We can not do that , say , to people -- hire people this year , train them for 26 weeks , and then when you get to next year , what 's going to happen is you 're going to go back to the higher rates of taxation . People will look and discount the future and therefore will not hire on the strength of something unless it has a time horizon equal to that of the benefits that you hope to achieve . You must create lower tax rates that last for a longer period of time if this is going to be able to succeed . </s>
Any kind of short term fix at this particular point is doomed to failure . There is no escape from that particular kind of conclusion . </s>
So then the question comes , and I’ll talk about this for the remainder of my time , what is it that we ought to do if it turns out that we think that for both macro and microeconomic reasons that the Obama tax plan is doomed to failure ? </s>
And it seems to me what we have to do is to start from the ground up and then think about how it ties into macroeconomic policy . So as a lawyer in particular , one of things that impresses me is at the same time we hear the grand talk about how it is we have to stimulate labor markets with respect to macro policies , we have an administration that has introduced very destructive policy at the micro level and all of these things have to be reversed . So if you want to start with some of the difficulties in question , just take for example , as one particular , the decision of the administration to chase after the Boeing company with respect to its decision to locate a plant in Columbus -- or Charleston rather , South Carolina . The net effect of this is that any time a union negotiation breaks down , an employer who tries to make an intelligent response by shifting states is going to be faced with a government prosecution . </s>
This is not an incentive to create new plants and new jobs . In effect what it is is it gives the union captive power over workers , over jobs in fact that a sensible employer might want to move to some other place . When you start looking at the other micro things , for example , in 2005 , what we decided to do was to raise the minimum wages . And it seemed to be a fine thing because those were optimistic days . </s>
But if those wages happen to go down in market terms at the same time that the minimum wage is moved up , what’s going to happen is at the lower level you’re going to find that it’s very difficult for lots of unskilled people to get that first job . And the point that was already said , namely if you don’t get the first job , you’ll not get the second and third job is in fact something which has been done . </s>
So this is another kind of policy that you have to be able to reverse under the circumstances of this case . And the list can go on . The government has decided that what it wants to do is increase the ability of unions to organize by allowing quickie elections to take place after it turns out that the requisite number of cards have been filed with the National Labor Relations Board . </s>
If you’re a small business trying to go in , it’s just a wonderful thing to note that after you’ve been in business for three or four weeks , all of a sudden you’re hit with a suit by a union which says we want to unionize , you’d better go out and find a lawyer otherwise capitulate to our demands . There is no way you can create things in a labor market under these circumstances if in fact you keep kicking people in the shins at the same time that you’re trying to subsidize it at the top . And also there is at present , the Obama legislation which is essentially designed to create all sorts of medical benefits through the health care system which is going to predicate itself upon the employment relationship . </s>
And these again are implicit taxes . So the final message that I want to leave you with is this . The way to deal with labor problems is not to talk about earthquakes ; it’s to talk about labor markets . </s>
And the way to talk about labor markets is to liberalize it such that when people realize their chances to get gains from trade , they will return to the hiring market . Thank you . Thank you Richard Epstein . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared US Debate where our motion is `` Congress should pass Obama’s jobs plan piece by piece . '' </s>
Remember we had you vote before the debate to tell us where you stand on this motion . We’ll have you vote again at the end of the debate asking as which side you feel argued best and the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner . So now on to round two where I ask questions to the debaters . They address one another . </s>
We take questions from you . Our motion is `` Congress should pass Obama’s jobs plan piece by piece . '' We have two teams of debaters . We have Cecilia Roust and Mark Zandi who are presenting the argument in favor of this motion and in favor of the jobs plan , arguing that they feel that it is absolutely critical to avoiding another recession . </s>
That workers who are not floating , who are sinking , are going to lead to no growth in the economy and if anything , a step backward , that this program at a minimum , at a minimum puts a stop in there . Arguing against them , Richard Epstein and Daniel Mitchell who argue that this is essentially another stimulus plan , that historically stimulus plans do not work and that it is rife with all kinds of bureaucratic induction of distorted enhancements that will make it difficult for businessmen simply to hire people and make decisions going forward . And therefore , if it were passed , it would never work . </s>
That’s where the two sides stand on this . </s>
And I want to start with the question to the side arguing for the motion and to Mark Zandi . With your opponents arguments very strenuously . But essentially this is a stimulus program , and I think you agree with that , and you 're saying that , in your argument , that this is needed to avoid a recession . And you have argued that stimulus programs have already worked in this administration in doing good . </s>
I wanted you to take on their argument that historically , that 's not the case at all . Well , I do n't think that 's true . I think fiscal stimulus is a tried and true policy response to recession . </s>
Since every recession since World War II , we 've had fiscal stimulus . </s>
In fact , the degree of fiscal stimulus provided is commensurate with the severity of the recession , at least as measured by the unemployment rate . And in fact , one could argue that the fiscal stimulus that was provided in this recession , the great recession , was inadequate . It was not proportional to the severity of the recession . </s>
And that 's one of the reasons why the economy has n't engaged to the degree that I think most would have thought at this point . Moreover , I 'm not alone in this view . Cece brought up the Congressional Budget Office . The CBO is a nonpartisan group respected by both Republicans and Democrats . They score the various proposals made by policy makers , tax policy and spending policy . </s>
And they do studies of various stimulus packages . And they released the estimates on the impact on GDP , on jobs , unemployment on a regular basis and they show consistently that they believe that this had been -- Okay . -- a plus to the economy . So you 're saying it 's a mainstream view . </s>
I 'd like to bring it to Richard Epstein on the other side . Look , I think in effect we 've seen the results already . At the time that the Obama administration introduced its first stimulus program , there was a confident prediction supported by the CBO that it would lower the unemployment rate down to eight percent . </s>
Nothing of the sort happened . It stayed exactly dead level under the circumstances . So the question is , why is this going to happen ? </s>
And essentially the CBO scores in a very static way . It listens to what the administration says about the number of dollars they 're going to spend and the cost for particular jobs , and it thinks that economics is a form of multiplication and subtraction and addition . The problem is the money has to come from somewhere . </s>
And the basic tradeoff that you have is this : If in fact you decide to run this thing through a stimulus program , you must raise taxes . If you raise them , as is now proposed on the most productive individuals in society , it turns out that you 're taking money from the hands of people who know how to use it and to put it into the hands of a government which simply does not . So the prediction is , at this particular time , what will happen is exactly the same thing that happened before . </s>
There will be a short-term burst , and then magically , there will be another earthquake , and the program will fail . Okay . Cecilia Rouse , I 'd like you to respond . </s>
There were a bunch of points in there , including do n't trust the CBO , I think . Never . Never trust the CBO . </s>
percent unemployment . That was n't the CBO . Yeah , that was n't the CBO . Well , who did ? Did you ? Cecilia . </s>
But Richard 's point about these programs remove money from people who make the best use of it and give it to those who do n't , can you take that on ? Well , you know , there is a theory in public finance that says that you should n't have a very high marginal tax rate on the very highest earners . But if you actually look at the -- in our experience over time , there 's not a great relationship between the highest marginal tax rates and how we 're doing in terms of economic growth . If you look at Reagan , he lowered tax rates for high income individuals . </s>
Clinton increased them . </s>
And you saw somewhat greater economic growth under Clinton than under Reagan . So I think the evidence tells us that , yes , there is -- these are tax rates . </s>
So I 'm not going to say that there 's no impact at all in terms of lowering economic growth , et cetera . </s>
But it 's very small for the highest earners because they do n't spend the tax cuts . </s>
And it does n't have that big of an impact on their earnings . You know , some have looked at what some of the highest paid CEOs did with their tax cuts . </s>
Some of them , it 's true . They exercised stock options creatively and strategically . But in terms of their general income , which is really the income-generating activity , there was really no impact . </s>
So I actually think that this is -- I think it 's a small tax increase today , but -- not today , it 's in a couple of years , and that it 'll be at a time when the economy can actually sustain it . Daniel Mitchell . Well , a couple of points . </s>
One good thing about being a libertarian is I do n't have to respect the CBO because CBO , like a lot of the Keynesian models , they presuppose their results . It 's just a mathematical formula . If the mathematical formula is wrong , if they automatically assume that if the government increases spending by X , the economy goes up by Y , and they never pay attention to the fact that while the economy actually went down by Z , they say , well , it would have gone down by more than Z if it was n't for the government spending . </s>
So it 's sort of this perpetual motion machine of economics . The White House in 2009 said if you pass the so-called stimulus , the unemployment rate will never rise above eight percent . </s>
And instead , it 's never dropped below nine percent . </s>
Let me just fact check you to the other side . </s>
Is that accurate ? </s>
Cecilia Rouse . That -- okay . So that was n't the White House . That was a transition paper by Christina Romer and Jared Bernstein . Okay . </s>
So -- But you have to remember -- -- the head of the Council of Economic Advisors . No . </s>
We were n't at the CEA at that point . </s>
But here is -- But the person who wound up there . </s>
Okay . So here is the point about that number , though , right ? There 's always a counter factual . </s>
And as it turned out , they generated that estimate based on what they knew at the time which was in December 2008 . As it turned out , the economy was a lot sicker than what they even knew . Well , the unemployment rate was higher when they did the forecast . </s>
It was . </s>
Exactly . They did n't know it . So in other words , that 's -- the Krugman is that no matter how much Keynesianism fails , you just should have spent more money . </s>
But that 's what gets you eventually to becoming Greece . There is no way to -- They keep spending more money . </s>
Richard Epstein . There 's no way to falsify that proposition because if things go better , the stimulus did it . If things go worse , they would have been even worse still . So the question is , why do we believe when we 've had a system of stagnation , when what you propose are short- term stimulus , which by definition will drop off . </s>
These are not going to have long-term benefits . You 're eating your seed corn . </s>
Remember , tax revenues are down to an all- time low . Government expenditure is to a high . </s>
You now have 40 percent of the budget which is being financed by deficits . And the question is , how long is that going to be sustainable ? There is an optimism in your position that somehow or other we can go from short-term stuff to long-term stuff , and yet there 's no explanation as to how that transition is to be made -- </s>
And , Mark , Richard is also making the point that you really ca n't prove your claims for stimulus spending having worked , because as he says , you 're saying , well , it would have been worse if they had n't . So what -- I can’t counter-factual . I mean , we ca n't prove the counter-factual . But where does that put you in terms of your argument ? </s>
And winning that argument is a big thing . </s>
Well , I tried to make my case with respect to timing . I mean , that 's more obvious , right ? </s>
So February '09 , the stimulus , the one that we 're focused on , most people are focused on , passed . </s>
It was mid February '09 , I believe . In February '09 , we lost literally 750,000 jobs . We lost 750,000 jobs in January , we lost 750,000 job in March . </s>
The economy was shrinking rapidly . We were in a free fall . By June , the recession was over , not by my definition , by the National Bureau for Economic Research . </s>
By one year later , we were having job growth . So , okay , you could argue maybe the economy magically would have found its footing without help from the federal government . And I 'm not saying stimulus was the only thing . There were many policy responses . There was the Federal Reserve . </s>
There were the TARP programs . </s>
There were lots of different things . We know -- </s>
But I think it 's fair to say , just given the chronology of events , that the stimulus had a very positive impact . The economy would have performed measurably worse . No , because at the same time , you have to -- Richard Epstein . </s>
-- predict that the stimulus also would fizzle . </s>
And that 's exactly what it did . So in other words , there are two ways to look at this . What you do is you give people a boost of adrenaline , and they start running furiously . </s>
And then you 've depleted their future resources , and there 's nothing left to recoup . And the question here is long-term sustainability . As Cecilia said , if you 're worried about labor markets , keep people out at the beginning , and it 's going to affect them for the rest of their lives . And so what I do n't understand is why do n't you take up the proposals to deregulate the labor markets to increase the expansions from gains from trade ? </s>
Okay , can I respond ? Yeah . Mark Zandi . I concur . I concur . </s>
I agree with you entirely that the stimulus efforts are not a source of long-term growth . </s>
They are not . They were never intended to be . They were to provide support to the economy in a time of crisis , when we were in free fall . But we also need policies , like the ones you 're talking about . And we can discuss the merits of it , where we need to focus on regulatory policy . </s>
We need to focus on tax policy . And most importantly of all , we need to focus on our long-term fiscal So you 're saying that jobs plan is the fire truck rushing from the fire house right now . That 's exactly what it is . </s>
If you had asked me to come to this debate six months ago when the economy was -- we were creating a couple hundred thousand jobs a month , I 'd say , `` John , I 'm not coming . '' Yeah , but can I ask you -- But I -- you know , and I 'm not a hard -- Keynesian theory works at specific points in time . It 's not an immutable fact . </s>
It does n't work in every environment . All right , Dan -- </s>
This is an environment where -- Wait , wait , Richard , let 's -- Richard , let your opponent have the mic for a minute . </s>
Daniel , can you respond to the point that Mark just made , that sometimes at specific points in times it works . </s>
In your remarks earlier , you said pretty much I think that it never works . Well , if you take a long-term view and not just cherry-pick an odd month here or there , and you go back in time , and you look at different countries where they have tried Keynesianism , it has n't worked . And one of the most interesting periods is when we did n't try Keynesianism . The recession coming out of World War I was very steep . We did n't do anything . </s>
The economy recovered very rapidly . And probably even more interesting is what happened after World War II . </s>
All the Keynesians thought we were going to have a giant recession . They wanted to plan massive public work spending and things like that . But Republicans control Congress . We had gridlock , we had stalemate . </s>
That turned out to be a wonderful thing . Because government did n't do anything and the economy relatively quickly digested millions and millions of people of being demobilized from war . In other words , the Hippocratic Oath about do no harm I think really applies , not to mention the fact that at some point we should consider why do we get recessions in the first place which in many cases is because of government policy mistakes , housing subsidies , easy money policy by the Fed , and things like that . Right , but -- you 're welcome to -- you do n't have to suppress stuff . </s>
It sounded so timid and halfhearted . I want the other side to respond . You just gave us an incident in which you said there was a recession without stimulus , and there was a terrific comeback , and that proves -- that establishes that at least in that instance , if we 're going to talk about specific situations , that it -- you can get out of it without this kind of program , and I 'd like this side to respond to that . Well , you mean -- okay . </s>
You 're going to drag me into the 1950s ? A little bit . Okay , all right , okay , fair enough . I do n't agree with that interpretation -- </s>
Well you know what , let Cecilia -- No . I actually do n't want to speak to this specific point , but I -- </s>
All right , no , no -- I want -- I just to that point . </s>
Okay . The 1950s were actually a pretty difficult period . Now , I 'm not arguing that stimulus would 've been the right – that big public works project would 've been the right response to that , but , you know , the '50s were n't the greatest decade . It was -- I 'm talking about the 1940s , though . </s>
Well , you said after the recession -- I mean , after the war , World War II ended in 1945 , and then that period -- then we had the Korean War which was a lot of fiscal stimulus , and then the 1950s was a period of really no growth . In fact , we had three recessions in the 1950s , and it was a very difficult time . So I do n't know , maybe . </s>
That 's stretching the limits of my historical experience , but -- and I know in our recent history , stimuluses work quite well , and in the most recent period , it 's been highly successful . Richard Epstein , what -- the president 's plan also calls for putting investment into jobs that would rebuild highways , and bridges , and airports , and waterways , all of which , you know , it 's clear we need , what 's wrong with that ? There 's nothing wrong with doing it so long as you do it correctly and so long as you do it systematically , and what 's happened is , of course , with the rise of the transfer society , there 's been a systematic neglect of infrastructure . </s>
And so clearly money has to go there , but if you look at this particular statute and the elaborate hoops that you have to go through , it is not a bill which is designed to promote infrastructure . </s>
It is a bill which is designed to make sure that the president 's supporters , strong union members get jobs which will allow them to contribute to the campaign to win . The difference between this particular -- -- well , I 'm glad to see that you all approve . But if you look at this program as against for example , the WPA , the administrative overlay that you have here is very , very much higher , and if you look at the way in which this relates to the employment jobs , the last stimulus program that was designed to deal with infrastructure was capital intensive and labeled weak , so that it had absolutely nothing to do , whatsoever , with jobs . So my own view about this is the infrastructure question should be handled on its own merits . </s>
It should not be bundled in with the stimulus bill , and once you get that right , if you look at this particular bill with its new and it 's four for the president , and three for the other side , that 's the last thing that you want to have running this kind of program . Cecilia Rouse , could you -- I know you want to get to another point and I 'll come back to that , but can you respond to -- Yeah , you know , first of all -- look , I 'm not a regulatory law expert , but my understanding is at least some of the provisions , such as the buy American provisions and the Davis Bacon , applied to infrastructure projects without this bill , meaning they 've been in statute for decades since the 1930s as you mentioned -- And that 's why we should get rid of it . Well -- but that would mean that in order for this bill to get rid of them , that would be something new in this bill . </s>
And so we could argue about the merits or not , but really all this bill is doing is making it consistent with current law . Yes , but the -- The agencies know how to administrate them , it does n't add an additional administrative burden , but like I said , we could argue the merits of it , but I think that , that 's not really the main purpose of the bill . </s>
When you have failed policies , you try to change them . You 're arguing for consistency , and I think that 's fine , but if you 're doing this as sort of an academic debate , the question is consistency , meaning getting rid of it across the board or keeping it across the board . And the question is -- that Dan put to you is how do we figure out , in theory , which way we want to go , and here 's one simple device . If you do n't know what you 're doing , do n't spend government money to do it . And these things are highly problematic , completely protectionist , and so , therefore , their elimination is something which is a matter of first principle should want , not only here , but in all the other bills . </s>
Davis Bacon is a public outrage , and there 's no reason why we ought to extend it . Cecilia , what was the question you wanted to bring up before ? The point that I was going to bring up earlier was more about how do we judge the value of stimulus and of the Recovery Act . And I really just wanted to say , `` Look , as Richard pointed out , the problem here is that we 're trying to argue about a counterfactual , but I 'm really sympathetic to -- '' </s>
Can you translate , `` We are trying to argue about a counterfactual -- '' About a counterfactual meaning . Okay we passed the stimulus . And the way we will judge whether a policy is effective , we say what would have happened had we not done so . </s>
So we passed it . I don’t yet have a time machine . President doesn’t have a time machine , so we can’t go back and unpass it and see what would have happened had we not passed it . Therefore what economists have to do is try to say , try to create that counterfactual , what would have happened in its absence . </s>
Okay , I’m very sympathetic to the Keynesian multipliers , just sort of mindlessly applying the multiplier and saying what would happen . Which means what ? Which means that economists have estimated okay , if we spend this much on infrastructure spending , then it’s going to chug through the economy and we’re going to get this much out and it’s going to create this much employment . </s>
And that’s their way of doing a counterfactual in a sense . I’m a micro-economist . </s>
My job is , I do a lot in education , it’s to do a lot of evaluation of programs , so that doesn’t make sense to me . But what does make sense to me , is that there’re some economists that have not taken that route but have said instead , well can we compare the outgrowth of , or the employment growth in states where they’ve got more money , or in localities where they got more money than in others . Now , you might worry that okay , well but why did some get more money than others . Maybe you got more money because you were doing more poorly . They’ve tried to adjust for that in very creative and credible ways I might add . </s>
And this is not by economists that were working for the Obama administration or really had a dog in the hunt . </s>
And what they find is , it was actually fairly positive as well . So I’m fairly convinced that not just with one methodology do we find that the stimulus made a difference , but using a variety of them . Will we ever know for sure ? No . I can see that because I think that’s what my business -- we have to be humble about that . </s>
It seems to be down on the other side , that you will never know for sure that it doesn’t work in the same way that they’re saying for sure that it does work . Well that’s why I made my remarks during , about economists having a little bit of humility because we’re trying to predict things that are fundamentally -- we’ll never know the right answer . We’ll be debating , we’ll all be 80 years old up here having the same debate . </s>
But I do think looking at history , looking at periods where we tried Keynesianism versus periods when we didn’t , I think there is a pattern there that supports the negative proposition in this debate . Also , you look at countries around the world during this recent economic downturn . It’s been fairly global . Counties that were much less Keynesian in their approach , like Germany and Canada , seem to do better than countries that were more Keynesian in their approach like the United Kingdom and the United States . But again , there are 50 different policies out there and we’re trying to focus on just the narrow issue of fiscal policy . </s>
And so it really is a challenge . And I think all of us up here want America to be more profitable and have more jobs . So I think we all start from the same goal , but it really is difficult to figure out what’s going to work . But I do look at Europe and the fact that they’ve gone down this path of deficit spending and it really does seem to eventually lead you into a cul-de-sac . And they’re in very serious trouble . </s>
And I worry about , I have three kids , I don’t want America to be like Greece in 15 or 20 years . All right , I’m going to go to questions from the audience . Can I just make one point ? Let me just do this , and then while the mic’s are moving , you can make your point , are you cool with that ? </s>
Sure . So , what will happen is , if you raise your hand , I’ll find you and a microphone will be brought to you . We ask you to stand up and tell us your name and then ask a question that is focused , terse , on point , and really is a question . And no two parters or three parters . And also what doesn’t work is , I’d like to hear every member of the panel tell me their list of because it would just take up too much time . </s>
So those are the questions that I’ll have to throw out , so I just want you to think about that . And while you’re getting ready , Cecilia . I just wanted to thank Dan for bringing up Germany and Canada . </s>
Because , one of the reasons why many people believe that , especially Germany , which had a larger , or Germany did not suffer the same employment losses that we did and many people have asked why . And Canada as well , and both of them have work sharing programs , which were very active . So many people believe , and again if you ask German economists what exactly explains it , you’ll get many answers . But one of the reasons is because German employers were not obligated to try to adjust to the downturn by laying off all of their workers . That’s a lot of the reason why the president actually was looking to Germany and we’ve been trying to expand our own work sharing program for exactly this reason . </s>
You could do work share programs voluntarily without government intervention . Okay , let’s go to some questions from the audience . Sir , right there . Yeah , yes sir . </s>
Remember the rules . </s>
Daniel . Can you tell us who you are ? My name 's Robin Yellen . Thank you . </s>
You mentioned just now that , to me the whole argument is stimulus , no stimulus , this is basically what it sounds like to me . </s>
Now , you’ve mentioned earlier that in , after the First World War , there was a recession , but America survived it , and everything came right . After the Second World War , the same thing . But after two world wars , countries were in situations where they had to build . </s>
They had to rebuild . They had to restructure everything . And that , to me , is what President Obama is proposing , is the restructuring , building again to get things going . Do you not think that 's -- that was a stimulus all on its own ? Thank you . </s>
Dan Mitchell . If I understand your question correctly , no , I do n't . The reason I pointed out the recession of 1920 , which , if we did n't have the Great Depression that would have been viewed as our Great Depression because the macroeconomic numbers were absolutely terrible then , worse than anything we had ever experienced . And politicians did n't do anything , and the economy quickly recovered . </s>
We 've always had downturns . And the question is how quickly do we get out of the downturn , what malinvestments and economic mistakes were made , and did the economy have the ability to quickly adjust ? </s>
My concern about stimulus , if you define stimulus by government involvement and intervention , I think it hinders and retards the economy 's ability to adjust and to sort of digest the mistake that caused resources to be misallocated . And I think what 's happening today , not only under Obama , but also under Bush , we have gotten to a point where government is so big , so -- you know , just involved in all sectors of the economy , not just spending and taxes , but regulations and intervention , the types of thing Richard was talking about . We have moved to a lower growth level that we may be stuck with permanently in the same way that Europeans have had these , for decades now , slower rates of economic growth . </s>
Okay . And that 's what 's important to me . Along the right side . Oh , I thought I saw a bunch of hands go up there . </s>
Sorry . </s>
Right in the center here . Yes . </s>
If you look to your right , I think it 'll come faster . </s>
My name is Gene Epstein . A question for those who support the proposal . If there is indeed a crying need for jobs right now , and if there are indeed structural problems in the economy , partly caused by government right now , that could be altered , would n't you want to pick up on Richard Epstein 's proposal right now to address those problems so that we can have job creation , such as the harassment of Boeing , the greater -- Okay . -- strength in -- </s>
I 'm going to stop you there because you -- -- and so on . You actually asked a perfect question , and so Mark Zandi , do you want to take that on ? Hi , Gene . How are you ? </s>
Good to see you . I recognize the voice . Yeah . We have n't talked in a while . Please give me a call , Gene . </s>
Yeah . You do n't return my calls , Zandi . Oh , yeah , yeah . I return everybody 's call . I think I would do both . </s>
I think Cece said it nicely . You know , policy makers can walk and chew gum at the same time . And we need to do that . </s>
I do sympathize with a lot of the points that are being made with respect to regulatory policy and government intervention . I do think some of the policy steps have created uncertainty for businesses and for the banking system . </s>
And that 's impaired the ability and willingness of businesses to step up and hire and for banks to lend . So I sympathize with that perspective . And I think we need to work on policies to address that . But that does not preclude the fact that we need to reduce some of the fiscal restraint that 's dead ahead of us . If we do n't make some policy steps here , taxes are going to rise on everybody . </s>
Unemployment insurance for many hard-pressed households are going to expire . And that 's the prescription for a recession . All right . </s>
Now speaking of right now , I want to mention our media partner in these debates is Slate . And in fact we 're being live-streamed on Slate right now . </s>
So to everybody who 's watching on Slate , welcome . And thanks for being with us . And we 've asked you to submit questions . And there 's a `` right now '' type of question , or its reverse from a Rhonda DuBose -- I 'm sorry , from a Darin Clements in Williamsburg , Missouri , who asks , since the jobs bill is basically a temporary funding program , what are -- what are the prospects for this actually having an impact on long-term employment ? Are we really talking about jobs , or are we only talking about getting money into the system for stimulus ? </s>
Are people really going to be better employed in the long term as a result of this program ? Can I -- Cecilia Rouse . </s>
Yeah , please . Here 's the -- this is what I worry about . </s>
I think our economy has made significant progress in righting the wrongs that got us into this mess . We 've reduced debt . </s>
The businesses are in very good shape financially . </s>
Households have made a lot of progress . There 's work to be done . We 've got foreclosure issues . </s>
The banking system is recapitalized . We 've made significant progress . We 're on the verge of a much better economy . </s>
But if we go back into recession , all that good , hard work is going to go down the tubes . And this is going to cost us enormously . </s>
We go into recession , revenues are going to fall because there 's going to be fewer people employed . Government spending 's going to rise because there 's automatic spending increases in our budget . </s>
People become unemployed , they 'll go get unemployment insurance . It 's going to cost us more than this package , a lot more than this package . So it 's not only about the very near term . It 's about the long run . We ca n't take that chance . </s>
If we go into recession , it 's going to undermine the fundamentals of our economy . Mark , the question is a little bit different . It 's about people actually having -- having jobs , having careers , if you will , being able to count on this going forward . </s>
And your opponents have argued that one of the problems they see with this , particularly something like -- like the tax holiday that 's being offered to employers , it 's a holiday , then it ends . And it 's so short term that there 's no real incentive for a company to hire workers . But this is the point , John . This is -- let me try one more time . Listen , if we go back into recession , all those fundamentals of our economy are going to erode . </s>
All the good things , all the progress we 've made is going is go away , and it 's going to hurt the ability of businesses to hire and people to get jobs for the long run , for a long time to come . We are running the risk of going into a Japanese-like decade if we go back in a recession in six to nine months . We just ca n't allow that to happen . But the difficulty -- </s>
Richard Epstein . -- with that is you can go into recession in 16 to 18 months . And you 're talking about the short-term disasters . What about the midterm disasters ? </s>
The advantage of the deregulation on the labor market side , which could be quite big , getting rid of industrial policies , no more cylinders and so forth , is that has an effect today . It has a long-term effect . </s>
It reduces the size of government burdens , and it increases the gains from potential hiring of labor . So I 'm going to ask you , Mark , just plain out , if you 're in favor of this bill . </s>
Would you get rid of the Davis Bacon provision and the -- and the ARRA provision and the unemployment discrimination provision ? </s>
I think the answer 's got to be yes . This gets to the question of political economy . We have no time left . </s>
But you are -- Wait , wait , wait . </s>
If you want -- you asked me a question . I 'm going to answer it . If we go down that path of trying to repeal these laws that have been in statute since 1930 , we 'll be debating this 10 years from now . </s>
And we 're toast . </s>
That 's not the -- So in -- and here 's the other point . </s>
And I 'm going to ask you a question . Of $ 450 billion in the package -- </s>
What ? $ 450 billion package . How much of that is subject to the statutes that you are concerned about by America ? </s>
A fair -- No . How much , exactly ? </s>
I do n't know the exact number . $ 50 billion . Okay . </s>
50 out of the 450 billion . </s>
Okay . Let 's get -- </s>
Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good . Let 's go back to the other point . I read the statute as well . </s>
No , no , no . That may be for the ARRA provisions . You 've got the Davis Bacon provisions . You 've got the employment discrimination provisions . Which . </s>
And so I 'm not asking you to repeal the statutes as they exist everywhere else . I 'm asking you not to put them in this particular bill . </s>
We 're going piece by piece . Will you get rid of these pieces ? You do n't have to repeal anything . </s>
You do n't have to have a long-term debate . </s>
All you have to say is , not with this one now . And all you 've told me is you do n't think it 's going to do a lot of good . I 'm going to tell you it 's going to do at least some harm . </s>
And spending nothing on this is a lot better than trying to say , we have to tie the two things together . You know it 's a political fix . </s>
I know it 's a political fix . Cecilia Rouse . Just disentangle . </s>
Cecilia Rouse . </s>
I just wanted to say something about the anti-discrimination provision . And take one minute -- To say what it is . Not even a minute , 15 seconds to remind us what this is about . </s>
I was going to do that . So many employers have actually been having their ads , when they post for employment , they say , `` if you are unemployed , you need not apply . '' We 'll not consider -- or you must currently have a job . </s>
So many employers have this in statute -- or not in statute , but they have that in their ads . And as a result , many people are concerned that this is not particularly conducive to employment growth . So , I understand that employers are being inundated with applications and with applicants . </s>
There are over four unemployed workers for every job opening . And employers are having to find ways to really sift through . </s>
And I also understand that we want to let employers hire who they need to hire , who they think is the best match . But let 's think of some of the negative spillovers of these ads to the rest of society , which is where I think we have a place for government intervention . First of all , imagine you 're an unemployed worker . Especially imagine you 're an unemployed worker who 's been unemployed for at least six months . </s>
So you 're actually bordering on discouraged . I actually know of a single mother who has been on welfare and is -- you know , marginally thinks she 's not very attractive to employers . You understand that employers are putting out these ads , you do n't even try to get a job . </s>
And the worst thing we want to do right now is to discourage workers from even trying , from even applying for jobs . So one is I think it discourages workers from even trying to get hired . The second negative spillover is that in our economy one of the ways in which young people in particular have job growth early in their career is by quitting jobs . </s>
We have a lot of dynamism in our labor market , and one of the problems we have right now is actually because of the labor market , we have fewer quits than we normally would have , and as a result , workers are staying in jobs , they 're not quitting , and so they 're not going to be climbing up the career ladder . </s>
It 's a negative spillover to the rest of society . Okay , Cecilia , let me stop you there for some response -- You know , look , I mean -- Dan Miller , please -- Richard , let Dan Miller come in . Mitchell , but that -- </s>
I 'm -- -- but I 'll go by Miller . No , there is no Miller here , Dan Mitchell . </s>
I want to make a point that some of you should get ready to hiss about because I think this point makes perfect sense but some people do n't like it , employers only hire people that they think is going to make them money . And so , therefore , when we 're considering what is going to increase -- oh , you 're ruining my fun by clapping instead of hissing -- -- so when we 're thinking about what in terms of like the boots on the ground type issue , what is going to convince companies to hire workers ? If you create a new potential legal liability with new government rules about how you 're writing your want ads and who you 're allowed to hire and what you 're allowed to say when you 're interviewing , is that going to increase or decrease the likelihood that companies are going to want to hire new people ? We want workers to be an asset to firms , not a liability , and this gets into of course all the other policies about what are the -- if we lower tax rates , will that help ? </s>
If we reduce government regulation of red tape , will that help ? </s>
I think markets , I think copying Hong Kong is a better idea than copying France . That in some sense is the summary of everything I would say this evening . </s>
Dan Mitchell , slight -- -- slight variation on that question , is not having held a job for six to nine months to a year an accurate indicator of your ability to do a job well and to hold onto a job ? Well , there 's no question we have a major problem with long term unemployment in this country . You know , five years ago I used to look at the OECD , Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data , international bureaucracy based in Paris . They look at industrialized countries , all sorts of interesting data . </s>
I do n't think we should be subsidizing them , but that 's a whole separate issue . It used to be that you would look at the data on six months-plus unemployment , and Europe had the terrible numbers , and we had the great numbers . </s>
And now we 've gone up to Europe and in some cases beyond , in terms of our long term unemployment . Now , interestingly , scholars like Paul Krugman and Larry Summers , at least when they 're outside their New York Times writing and their democratic administration appointments , have written that unemployment insurance subsidizes unemployment . Now , as an economist -- Wait , wait , wait , wait , what is the answer to my question , though ? Well , no , I 'm making -- the answer to your question is that we have a problem with long term unemployment , one of the reasons we have this problem is because the academic data shows that people get jobs much quicker when their unemployment insurance runs out , but we now are going on 99 weeks of unemployment insurance , and it sounds like you 're an ogre , and , yes , so hiss me , hiss me , but when even Larry Summers and Paul Krugman and their academic writings are saying , `` This increases unemployment , '' we need to figure out a better way of doing it then . </s>
Mark -- Mark Zandi , Mark Zandi , please . I just want to make one point about the jobs package . </s>
You know , there is money in the package , about 50 billion for unemployment insurance -- additional unemployment insurance , but in addition to that , there are a number of reforms to the unemployment insurance system that have been proposed . </s>
When Cece talked about the work share that 's very popular in Germany and credited for German success , there 's also a very popular program in Georgia called Georgia Works that helps send unemployed workers to get on the job training . These are things that have historically had bipartisan support . There 's empirical evidence that they work reasonably well . They do address some of the concerns Dan brought up . I -- they 're reasonable concerns . </s>
You know , you ca n't dismiss them . So I think it 's very important to realize that in the package there are efforts to address some of these things . Richard Epstein . Yes , I mean , to go back to the discrimination point and the part time point , on the discrimination issue , the evidence suggests that 150 firms have announced that they will not consider people . There are obviously going to be some more -- you 're talking about millions of companies , and many people get first jobs , and it seems to me that you can -- if you got rid of minimum wage that 's for teenagers it would do much more because then what you could do is to handle the problem of your decreased skills which everybody agrees takes place by making a compensating wage offer . </s>
And so freeing up markets will do much better than putting additional burdens on the overall economy in the way in which you 're doing . </s>
With respect to part time workers and so forth , the other thing to remember is we 've had a long term policy in which there 's constantly the notion that there are mandates for the kinds of benefits that you must supply to full time employees , which leads to this fine art where everybody now tries to become an independent contractor so you do n't have to supply health insurance in a variety of other situations . One way to improve the employment situation is to drop the mandate . And put it in another term . What the government has now said , there will be no jobs with lavish benefits or you can have real jobs with less benefits . </s>
In my view , if you’re trying to increase the employment levels , what you have to do is to stop putting the ties . </s>
If you wish to hire X , you must provide for them Y . Because what happens is that’s often the decider and it kills the labor markets . What we did for many , many years is to think that labor markets were robust so you could burden them with all sorts of restrictions . When you get bad times , these restrictions are a lot more costly and what they do is they create a lot more devastation . You can improve this market tomorrow . </s>
Richard , I have to stop you thee because I need to take a break . Do you know that when you speak , there’s only commas at the end of everything you say ? I was looking for the period to break in , and there were semicolons and dashes and commas . </s>
One continuous argument . Cecilia , I’m going to do a little break and then I’m going to come back to have you respond to it and then we’re going to go back to questions from the audience . </s>
Now I need some spontaneous applause from you , if you can do that . Thank you . </s>
Our motion is `` Congress should pass Obama’s jobs plan piece by piece . '' We’re in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . I’m John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We have four debaters , two teams of two , arguing this out and we are talking about the part of the jobs bill that would outlaw discrimination against workers who have been unemployed . </s>
And Cecilia Rouse is going to take up the point . So I just wanted to come back to that for just a moment because this law , what this proposes is not saying that employers have to hire a specific person . </s>
What it says is one , you can’t put it in the ad . Okay that is true , that is a restriction . You can’t put in the ad that you will not look at an unemployed person . And two it says that there can’t be a blanket policy , so there can’t be a memo . So what is -- let me say , it’s a largely symbolic gesture . </s>
The Obama administration caps damages at a thousand dollars if you actually put something in an ad . </s>
It caps it at $ 5,000 if you can come up with , if the EEOC , Equal Opportunity Employment Commission can actually come up with a memo documenting it . So it’s not , it’s meant to say look , we need for , at least , there not to be overt discrimination against those who are unemployed so we don’t discourage workers from trying to apply to a job . Doesn’t the act though also , allow for a waiver that there would be a government official who would have the job of saying well in this case , we’re going to give you a pass . Which does sound to me like one more layer of somebody making decisions for who you can hire and who you can’t and the ultimately this sin that is considered un- committable , you can commit if the government guy says this time we’ll let you go . Look , it really is meant to -- Governor Christie in my fair state , our Governor Christie passed a law that was similar . </s>
I’m not saying that makes it okay . But what I’m saying is that , it really is a problem if unemployed workers are discouraged from applying for jobs . And it 's really just saying employers try to make -- Let’s move on to another topic . </s>
In the red top , thanks . I’m Shaila Dewan from the New York Times and my question is for the no side . And the question is , what do you propose for the short term . I mean , if your proposals all seem to be about long term issues , if we’re going to do a tax cut , let’s make it permanent , that kind of thing . But what do you do for those unemployed people when their payments stop and they can’t get a job because there aren’t enough jobs ? </s>
What is your fire truck from the firehouse I think is the question . Richard Epstein . The answer that I said is , the only way this thing will stop is through liberalization of markets . If you repeal the restrictions against people getting jobs , employers will start to hire again . </s>
The difficulty with the umemployment situation is that the amount of revenues we have to spend now is probably two or three times the amount of taxes that we collect . </s>
And what happens is you will not be able to reverse that pattern so long as you think that stimulus at the grand level -- But Richard , the question is what is your short term solution ? </s>
My short term solution is deregulation . Get rid of mandates , get rid of minimum wages , get rid of the anti-discrimination proposals and so forth . </s>
Because what you laugh about , I think it’s fine for you to laugh , but I think you also ought to reflect upon the fact that if you don’t have gains from trade , you don’t get employment . And what’s happened is every time you put an implicit tax on the trade , what you do is release the opportunities for gains . </s>
This is the interesting feature about this , is the macroeconomic stuff everybody guesses about . The microeconomic stuff is perfectly clear . Okay , your partner Dan Mitchell . </s>
I would just like to make the point that good long-term policy also happens to be good short term policy . Now I come from a school of thought that says that if the economy has misallocation of labor and capital and a recession gets baked into the cake , there 's not much you can do but sort of just grit your teeth and try to get through it as quickly as possible . But government sometimes extends and delays and an economic downturn by interfering . I think that 's what happened in the 1930s with the Hoover-Roosevelt policies . </s>
I want to have a lower burden of government . I sort of throughout , as a throwaway line , I want to be Hong Kong rather than France . But there 's actually a very serious point behind it . </s>
If you look at all these different measures of economic freedom , Hong Kong 's always near the top . And France , among industrialized countries , is down lower . And I think that is one of the reasons why Hong Kong grows five to six percent a year on average , and France grows one to two percent a year . And if we want the unemployed to get jobs , we want a strong , tight labor market like we had during the Clinton years when government spending fell from 22 percent of GDP to 18 percent of GDP . And what happened during the Reagan years when we also had more free market oriented policies . </s>
That , I think is the best answer . Cecilia mentioned much earlier that Clinton raised taxes on the wealthy , and things got really good . </s>
No . He -- Clinton raised taxes , but he also did GAT and NAFTA and welfare reform , reduced government spending by four percentage points of GDP . He deregulated telecommunications and agriculture . I mean , if I could take everything else of Clinton 's policies and it meant that I had to take the 39.6 percent marginal tax rate , I 'd do it . We had a lot more economic freedom under Clinton than we 've had under Bush and Obama . </s>
Okay . Let 's take another question from the audience . Ma'am ? </s>
Yep . If you can stand and tell us your name . Hi . </s>
My name is Jane Doe , and I 'm proud to say I 'm not from -- I 'm not from the New York Times . My question is for Cecilia . By your own admission , you said that the Clinton administration was able to -- to increase economic growth , but did so because of monetary policy . And even President Clinton has said so on the Daily Show . My understanding is it 's not the job of the president to intervene in monetary policy . </s>
He 's admitted that he 's gone into -- Can you come to a question ? </s>
Yes . Thanks . -- in two seconds . Sorry . I paid a hundred thousand dollars to go to this university during the Clinton administration , so I 'd like to make my point and have her answer the question . </s>
Okay , but other people want to speak . My question is about monetary policy and the Clinton administration . I 'm a Democrat . His policies of fiscal policy did not increase economic growth . It was his monetary policy . </s>
Could you comment on it ? </s>
Well , look , I think that there was a lot of good fiscal policy that happened under the Clinton administration as well . So I 'm not going to agree with your premise that it was only the monetary policy and that there was no fiscal policy under Clinton . Now , was it necessarily fiscal policy in terms of stimulus as Dan has mentioned ? </s>
There was a lot of other -- there was NAFTA . There were other attempts to stimulate economic growth . </s>
But -- No , no . Can -- no , we -- seriously . </s>
And also I want to move on because we 're not talking about the Clinton administration . Exactly . And -- and , sir , down in the front . I hope you have gotten your money 's worth , though , in terms of a diploma and the whole thing . </s>
Question for Dan Mitchell . </s>
You earlier mentioned Germany . Now , looking at this , on the one side , it increases taxes for high income Americans but it reduces taxes for lower income Americans . Is n't that what -- what has been done in Germany ? </s>
That 's how you do a question . Dan Mitchell . As the Germans would say , `` Der good . Der good . '' </s>
What I was focusing on in my comments on Germany is what happened to government spending as a share of GDP . Germany did not do a big Keynesian stimulus program . </s>
It does n't mean that I want to embrace German fiscal policy because the overall burden of government spending is higher , actually not that much higher than it is in the U.S . They 're something like 44 percent of GDP . We 're getting close to 40 now after the Bush-Obama spending binge . But Germany did n't do a Keynesian stimulus package of any magnitude close to the U.S . And I think that served them well , similar to what happened in Canada . Now , other things were involved . </s>
Canada never had a housing bubble . And of course that helped a lot . There 's a ton of different economic policies that matter . But my point on Germany was just a simple one , that they did n't do the Keynesian policy -- </s>
Okay , Mark -- Mark Zandi would actually like a crack at that question . Yeah , no , I was just going to make the point that the Germans provided just as much fiscal support to their economy as we did in the recession . The difference is that in Germany , they have automatic stable -- what 's called automatic stabilizers in their budget . </s>
That means that there is more unemployment insurance . </s>
There is more welfare . There are -- the tax code is such that you generate a lot more fiscal support . In the U.S. , we have some automatic stabilizers , but they 're not nearly as large as in Europe . </s>
And therefore , when we get into recessions , we rely more on what we 're calling fiscal stimulus . That is temporary tax cuts and temporary spending . </s>
Okay . </s>
So in terms of the fiscal support to the economy , the Germans did exactly what we did in terms of the GDP . It 's hard for me to see folks that are not in the lights , so I have to keep calling down towards the front . If somebody is up there , wants to take a step down , I 'll try to call on you . But for -- oh , actually , yeah , so I see you standing up . Can you come down into the -- walk toward the light . </s>
Just five or six steps , and then we can see you . </s>
Thanks . He 's a tough moderator , is n't he ? I mean he -- No . No , no , no . </s>
And -- but I do need this to be terse and , you know -- This addressed to the opponents who -- Can you give -- sir , can you tell us your name , please ? Arthur Tannenbaum . </s>
Thank you . </s>
From where I sit , you 've been talking mostly about structural issues . This motion is supposed to be directed towards cyclical issue . </s>
So my question for you is this : Is n't it a fact that we 've had a number of recessions since World War II ? There 's been some form of stimulus that was the response to each of those recessions ? And we have always come out of these recessions and started growing again . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Dan Mitchell . Well , the question is -- Okay , Richard , do you want to take it ? </s>
Yeah . Okay . Richard Epstein . Why not ? I mean , I think it 's a fair question . </s>
But , of course , we always came out of them . We 're not coming out of them now . So the question is , what 's the source of the difference ? And the answer is that the degree of regulation that you have with respect to the economy now has deprived it of the kind of flexibility that allows it to respond . And it 's in all the markets . </s>
Thus far we 've talked mainly about labor markets . </s>
And those are completely tied up by the kind of regulations that are put into place . Every point and effort to try to revive the housing markets by giving mortgage support programs have turned out to be complete failures . </s>
The correct response on that may sound harsh , but in fact , it 's the only way to get back the stability which is that banks decide to foreclose , tenants , current owners go , and the property re-circulates at lower rates so that you get the housing market start . You can not keep a housing market going when essentially you allow people to remain in possession while the underlying value of the assets go down . So our position is really quite this . This stimulus program we do n't think it does very much good and has already exhausted itself . </s>
But the mid-level regulations that you see in mortgages , in labor , in the banking industry , in the health care industry , all of these things are novel drags . These are discreet programs introduced by -- Okay . I 'm going to -- I 'm going to stop you because -- </s>
and those are the source of the difficulty . I 'm going to stop you because we have to let you make you that point . </s>
And , sir , in the blue shirt . Yep , if you can stand , please . </s>
My name is Scott Stevens , and I have a question for Mr. Zandi . You say that the $ 450 billion stimulus should keep us out of recession . Could you put a number on that ? How many percent in growth do you think we 'll get from the stimulus compared to the counter factual ? </s>
Is that enough , do you think ? And -- I think your answer to that is quoted on the White House blog , actually . Yeah , it is . I have n't had a chance to read that . </s>
Yeah . Yeah . Which , as I said earlier , means it 's right , right ? So , Mark , why do n't you take that question ? Put -- </s>
Do you have something else you 'd like to say ? I 'd like to keep it as a one-part -- </s>
It 's enough and -- Yeah . Okay . Considering that it 's being paid for too , that 'd take a lot of the growth away from it . Right . </s>
And while you 're at it -- No , no . </s>
That 's good . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Yes , and the Cardinals will win the World Series , yes . You like that , huh ? Well , if you do the arithmetic , the math , under current policy , if there is no change in policy , federal fiscal policy will shave 1.7 percentage points from GDP growth in 2012 . </s>
State and local governments’ cuts will take the total fiscal drag -- this is the headwind to the economy -- to two percentage points of GDP . </s>
The Obama jobs package provides stimulus equal to two percent of GDP . So the intent is to neutralize the fiscal drag . Now , you know , if I were king for the day , I 'd say , you know , we can digest some fiscal austerity . We do n't have to go the whole Monty here , but we need to do something . We ca n't just -- we 're not going to be able to digest two percentage points . </s>
All right . So you were very specific . I want to go to the other side and say that he was very specific . </s>
Well , there 's a certain beauty to being exact about something . But if you go back and look at what Mark was saying in 2010 and what Mark was saying in 2009 and what Mark was saying in 2008 , and then you compare those things to reality , they 're always different than what actually happened . </s>
Now , of course , Mark will say , but other things happened in the economy . No , no , I think I got it right . </s>
But I think this gets at the problem that when you have a model that presupposes the results , Mark has a model and if you put in the certain amount of government spending , that will automatically spit out a certain number of GDP unemployment , probably depending on how it 's spent . I 'm sure there are some greater details to it . CPO has the same model , and these are the kinds of models that gave us the White House , I guess , Transition Team document that said if we squandered $ 850 billion , our unemployment rate would never go above eight percent , and it just did n't work . </s>
It does n't matter how many decimals you have in your estimate . If the fundamental underlying premise is wrong , it does n't work . Okay , on that -- You 're not giving me a chance to respond to that , John ? What 's that all about ? </s>
You 're going to say you were right . Okay , all right . That 's really why I 'm not coming back . </s>
You 're going to say you were right . And down the front ? </s>
Hi , my name is Giovan Jucovovic . </s>
I would like to ask a question to the opponent to this . </s>
You seem to be presenting a broader and more long term vision for what you think with deregulation and whatnot . I would like to know how your plan of deregulation in general in the economy would benefit Americans besides the wealthiest of Americans and what specifically this would do by creating , like you say , abolishing minimum wage , creating low paying jobs , how would this really benefit Americans as a whole and not just the top one percent ? </s>
And how soon ? </s>
The top one percent -- Richard Epstein . First of all , with respect to the top one percent , I think one ought to look at some of the numbers . The amount of revenue that has been collected from the top one percent in the last -- from 2007 to 2009 declined by about 30 percent , so that what you 're trying to do is to hit a top figure and assume that nothing you could do to them can hurt them . </s>
They have been hurt in terms of the money they have very much . Oh , laugh , if you may , but remember , 40 percent of that goes into your tax revenues . </s>
So every time , what you do is you cut the revenue at the top , you cut the revenue for the programs that are needed to support the stimulus . </s>
Dream on if you think that you can avoid that kind of situation . If you reduce income at the top , you reduce the amount of money available for transfer . Mark Zandi , do you -- At the bottom , what you have to do is if you reduce these things , you would get people on the job ladder . The moment they are on the job ladder because employers now find it in their interest , they will advance . </s>
When you look at -- for example if people could get in at minimum wage jobs , typically within six months or less they have managed to promote themselves to another type of job . This can take place immediately , but it will not take place by employers unless they have some confidence in the long term stability of the system . Every major tax measure that we have now has a two-year timeframe on it so that the uncertainty dominates in my judgment the kinds of stimulus that you hope to get by the spending policy . And that concludes round two of our debate . And here 's where we are -- we 're about to hear a brief closing statement from each debater in turn , they will be two minutes each , uninterrupted . </s>
And remember how you voted before the debate , because this is their last chance to try to persuade you to vote for their arguments at the end , and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . So on to round three . These are closing statements from each debater in turn , two minutes each . Our motion is this , `` Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece , '' and here to summarize his position against this motion , Daniel Mitchell , senior fellow at the Cato Institute . Congress should not pass the president 's job proposal either in its entirety or piece by piece because it represents a fundamentally misguided view of the economy , that you can make yourself richer by taking money out of one pocket and putting it in the other . </s>
I think the historical evidence , the cross-country evidence does not support the Keynesian theory . But more importantly , I think good long run policy is good short run policy . I want to try to get back the labor market conditions we had under Reagan and Clinton , and the one common characteristic of what we had under both Reagan and Clinton was that economic freedom in America broadly defined -- so we 're not just talking the fiscal policy , but more than just fiscal policy affects the economy -- economic freedom in America increased during the Reagan years and the Clinton years , by contrast , economic freedom declined during the Bush years , and that decline has continued during the Obama years . </s>
And if we accept -- even if we do n't like it , if we accept the notion that jobs are only created when employers think that it 's going to be profitable to create those jobs , we need to figure out what type of economic conditions will lead to that greater prosperity . </s>
And , again , I come back to what originally was a joke line , but I really want to make a premise , why is it that an economy like Hong Kong manages to grow so fast over such a long period of time , it takes in enormous amounts of immigrants , people rise from poverty to prosperity relatively quickly . </s>
That’s the kind of economy I want to mimic . </s>
Not because I care about the top one percent . The top one percent have never really , I don’t know , maybe some of them gave to the Cato Institute , so if you’re out there listening , I love you . But I care a lot more about the people at the bottom than at the top . </s>
If there’s a recession , the Donald Trumps and Warren Buffetts and Bill Gates of the world never have to worry about how their household budget is going to be balanced . That’s why I want to copy Hong Kong . In France , the rich people have figured how to work it ; I don’t care about them . Thank you . Thank you Daniel Mitchell . </s>
Our motion , `` Congress should pass Obama’s job plan piece by piece '' and here to summarize his position for the motion , Mark Zandi , chief economist at Moody’s Analytics . Thank you John . </s>
I want to thank you for the opportunity again . And I commend the other group for articulating their views so thoughtfully . I sympathize with a lot of what’s being said by the other group . </s>
I do think that the economy is encumbered by regulatory , legal uncertainty . We have made some major changes to our economy , to our health care system , to our banking system . </s>
And these are difficult things for businesses and individuals to adjust to . And I do think we need to work hard in reducing that regulatory and legal uncertainty . </s>
And we do need to take steps to address our long-term problems . Again I think it’s vital that we work to achieve fiscal sustainability , to get the long term deficits down so that our nation doesn’t go the way of Europe or France . I think tax reform is absolutely vital . I think it’s key to bring down the tax expenditures , the tax credits and deductions in the tax code , make the tax code much fairer , simpler . I think our economy would be better for it . </s>
And I actually am quite optimistic about our economic prospects . </s>
I think , as I said earlier , we have come a long way . Our economy has righted a lot of the wrongs that got us to this point . We’re really very close . </s>
We just can not go back into recession in the near future . </s>
That would be damaging , the collective psyche is on edge . You’re nervous ; I’m nervous ; we’re all very frazzled . Recession will just tip us over . The Obama jobs package , even if it’s passed in small parts , would go a long way to ensuring that we don’t go back into recession and that bright economic future actually will be upon us I think sooner than we realize . Thank you . </s>
Thank you Mark Zandi . Our motion , `` Congress should pass Obama’s jobs plan piece by piece , '' and here to summarize his position against this motion , Richard Epstein , professor at the New York University School of Law . Yes , I think what happens is everybody agrees on the importance of trying to get both short term and long term proposals . My view about this is , if we do not make long-term structural returns and make them soon , the stimulus program will not succeed . </s>
The most that you could get out of this is six or nine months . After that time , the long term structures will remain and you will fall into a recession that might be deeper than one that you take today . So what is it that you have to do ? You have to try to figure out why it is that in the last 10 years it has been a lost decade in terms of economic growth . </s>
And the answer is not that the stimulus program does or does not work . It is because all on mid-level institutions are inferior to what they were at an earlier time . The labor markets have become much more regulated . The banking industry has become much more concentrated at this particular point . </s>
Dodd-Frank will introduce all sorts of layers of confusion . The health care bill is a huge drain with respect to potential resources because the unemployment uncertainty is associated with the mandate and everything else are in fact going to wield a very heavy load on this system . The question is when will this load be bourn ? The answer is it will be bourn today . </s>
There is no way in effect that you can change the situation in the future if in fact you do not change the system correctly today . </s>
Employers and everybody else in this economy has rational expectations which don’t only look at the short periods , they look at the long periods . So if we start talking about stimulus programs which have never worked , what happens is we’re just going to add another layer of uncertainty on top of the layer of regulation . And we’ll be worse off than we are before . The question then is , will liberalization work ? </s>
And the answer is if you engage in a systematic program of retrenchment and repeal , these things in fact will take effect immediately and you will start to see some kind of reversal . We do have a serious problem . We must do something . But if we think of the economy as being somebody with a diabetic shock , we ought not to add fix it , add to it some sugar . </s>
Thank you Richard Epstein . The motion `` Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece , '' and here to summarize her position in support of the motion , Cecilia Rouse , professor of economics at Princeton University . So I do believe that Congress should pass the Obama jobs plan . </s>
I too am concerned about the impact of employer mandates on labor markets and believe we should be very judicious in looking at regulation . I think we should only put into place regulations where the benefits clearly exceed the costs . I think the evidence is n't really there that minimum wage is such an egregious regulation . But that would be another debate . However , if the Clinton administration in the Clinton years were such an example of economic freedom , in 2001 , we had a recession where we had a jobless recovery . </s>
So what happened ? Did the regulatory environment magically change with an election ? I think that what we have is -- what that tells us is that this regulatory environment is not going to address the cyclical changes . And I think we have a cyclical challenge right now . And so I think it 's appropriate for the Congress to step in . </s>
Now , as I said from the outset , I think one of the most important pieces of this is one that 's a tax relief for employees . I think continuing the federally funded unemployment insurance benefit is very important as well . </s>
I just want to add to that that Congress has always extended these benefits during times of recession . And the reason is clear . </s>
It 's pennywise and pound foolish not to do so . If workers and their families are n't supported , they 're going to end up on other government programs . And so Congress -- even Reagan did not stop supporting unemployment insurance benefits until employment had fallen below 7.5 percent . </s>
So I think Congress typically steps in during times of recession . I think there are good economic reasons for it to do so . </s>
And I think this is one of those times . </s>
More importantly , you know , as Mark has said very carefully , we really do risk falling into another recession which will be just devastating for all of us . Might doing nothing make a difference ? It might work . </s>
But I 've got to tell you , I 'm not a gambling girl , and I 'm just not willing to make that gamble for 42 million workers who are out of work and the millions more who are really suffering economically . Thank you . Thank you , Cecilia Rouse . And that concludes our closing statements . And that means it 's time to find out which side you feel argued best . </s>
We want to go again -- we want to ask you again to go to the keyboards at your seat and to register your vote for the team that you feel presented the best argument on this motion : `` Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece . '' </s>
If you feel that the side arguing for the motion has argued best , push number one . If you feel that the side arguing against the motion has argued best , push number two . And if you remain or became undecided , push number three . And we 'll have the results in about one minute and 17 seconds , actually . Come up quite shortly . </s>
Yes , yeah . So while that 's happening , I just want to -- I just want to say thanks to this panel for -- for the level of debate they brought to this and -- -- for the spirit and the style and the humor and the intelligence . And to everybody who got up and asked a question , the questions were pretty good tonight , so I want to thank you for having the nerve to stand up and ask the questions . We really do appreciate it . And to everybody who is out there watching on Slate , thank you to as well . </s>
So our final debate of the season will be on Tuesday , November 15th . And the motion that we 're debating is this : `` The world would be better off without religion . '' Arguing for the motion -- arguing for the motion , the great , great grandson of Charles Darwin whose name tragically is not Darwin because that would be -- his name is Matthew Chapman . </s>
He is an author , and he is a filmmaker , and he 's cofounder of Science Debate . </s>
His debating partner is A.C. Grayling . </s>
He is a renowned philosopher , humanist and an atheist who recently authored a book called `` The Good Book : A Secular Bible , ” a manifesto for rational thought . On the other side of that debate , we 're going to have Dinesh D’Souza who is the president of the King 's College and author of `` What 's so Great About Christianity ? '' And Rabbi David Wolpe who was named one of the most influential rabbis in America by Newsweek . We 'll be announcing our spring topics next month . Is that right , Dana ? </s>
Next month we 're going to have a list of our topics for the spring season , and we 'll have five more . And we hope to see all of you there . </s>
You can get a discount if you go to our Facebook page and join . And you can follow us as well on Twitter . Also , as I said before , and thank you for all of your -- your audibleness . </s>
These -- yeah , you were great . These debates are being carried on hundreds of NPR stations across the nation , and it 's glad -- it 's good to have you all breathing and speaking and voicing your opinions . So thank you . It really gives a sense of life to it . You 're also on television here in New York City on WNET13 and WLIW and NJTV . </s>
All right , now , it 's all in . We 've had two teams arguing out this motion : `` Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece . '' You voted twice , once before the debate to tell us where you stood on it , and again at the end of the debate after listening to these teams try to persuade you to their point of view . We 've asked you to choose which team argued the best . Here is the result . </s>
Before the debate on this motion , `` Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece , '' 45 percent were for the motion , 16 percent against , and 39 percent undecided . </s>
After the debate , 69 percent are for the motion . That is up 24 percent . 22 percent are against , that 's up only six percent . 30 percent -- nine percent are undecided . That 's down 30 percent . </s>
The team arguing for the motion that Congress should pass Obama 's jobs plan piece by piece carries the debate . Our congratulations to them . </s>
Thank you for me , John Donvan . And we 'll see you next time . Throughout the evening , because we 're broadcasting for radio , I 'll be doing a number of formal repetitions of particular phrases that 's might become tiresome to you . But just so you know , I 'll be telling you again and again what my name is , for example , when we come back from breaks and in a couple situations I may ask you to break spontaneously into applause to come back from a break . </s>
So you 'll know that it 's spontaneous because I 've told you to do so . </s>
I would like to introduce with great respect and appreciation the founder of Intelligence Squared U.S. who has made all of this possible and who will be framing the debate for us tonight , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Well , thank you very much , and thank you for joining us this evening . Now , I have a day job , and it 's running an insurance company . We cover some 8 percent of the U.S. work force for long-term disability and serious workplace injuries . </s>
So we see , first hand , that obesity is a major factor in driving claims costs , particularly those related to serious traumatic injuries . The most obese have substantially higher incident rates of diabetes and chronic heart disease as well . </s>
But does this necessarily mean that lower weight produces better health outcomes for everyone ? Do the moderately overweight need to go on crash diets or otherwise modify their eating habits ? When the government defines terms like `` overweight '' and `` obese , '' do those particular weight levels have any demonstrable connection with health outcomes ? </s>
The first lady has made childhood obesity her signature issue . But interestingly , the administration does not want to join the debate tonight . We 're disappointed that the current surgeon general was required to withdraw from the debate , but delighted that her predecessor , David Satcher is with us . He was actually the first to sound the alarm over obesity . </s>
So this brings me to the crux of tonight 's debate . </s>
If obesity is indeed a serious public health issue , what , if anything , should the government do about it ? Well , at a minimum , it can stop doing harm . Farm subsidies are targeted at producers of corn syrup and beef , for example , but not at producers of fruits and vegetables . </s>
School lunch programs are festooned with regulations that fly in the face of nutritional common sense . Aside from its sins of commission , can the government actively make things better ? </s>
Should we embrace ideas from Britain to treat parents of obese children as abusive or neglectful and then haul them into court ? Do calorie disclosures and requirements for healthy menu choices really change eating habits ? Indeed , are there any government obesity programs that in fact produce measurable health benefits in a cost effective way ? As usual , the issues tonight are complex . </s>
Fortunately , we have some outstanding panelists to shed light on them . </s>
And it 's my pleasure to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator , John Donvan . Thank you . Thank you . Thank you . And I 'd just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Yes or no to this statement : Obesity is the government 's business . We all eat , but do we do it wisely and well ? Well , obviously not . </s>
So who is supposed to fix that ? Well , that 's what we 're going to have out here tonight . This is another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan . </s>
We have four superbly qualified debaters , two teams of two , who are ready to get started . We 'll have three rounds of debate , and then the audience will vote to choose the winner , and only one side wins . </s>
And as we go into it and meet our debaters , ponder this thought : At one point in our history , the surgeon of the general of the United States raised the alarm about the number of Americans who were underweight . That was Dr. Hugh Cumming . He was the sixth surgeon general , and it was 1925 . And he certainly thought it was the government 's business that Americans were getting too few calories . So what happened ? </s>
How did we get to this world where Americans are getting too many calories ? Our motion is , `` Obesity is the government 's business . '' And arguing for this motion , I 'd like to introduce this team first , first Dr . David Satcher , who is the 16th surgeon general of the United States . And Dr. Satcher , you were the first to raise the alarm in 2001 about the obesity epidemic . </s>
And I want to just ask you very briefly , at that point , did you see us reaching this point where the numbers are where they are today ? </s>
Well , it was sort of a surprise when we saw what had happened over a 20-year period and the direction that we were going in terms of increasing obesity . So we did n't know how long it would take to begin to turn what we call the epidemic around . </s>
Thank you , Dr. David Satcher . </s>
And your teammate , Dr. Pamela Peeke , you started out life as a critical care doctor , and then you went back to school to learn nutrition . </s>
Motivated by what ? I became a Pew Foundation scholar in nutrition and metabolism because in medical school , I learned nothing . </s>
I did n't have a minute of nutrition taught to me . Yet here I was in the critical care unit where people -- where people 's lives were at stake . I had to keep them alive with food . And I was the most clueless person of all . </s>
I went back to school . Thank you . And welcome to our team arguing for the motion . Our team arguing against the motion that obesity is the government 's business includes Paul Campos . He is a modern-day version of the Renaissance man . </s>
He is a Shakespeare scholar , a law professor . </s>
He 's at the University of Colorado as well as a practicing attorney in certain times . But you 're here because of a book you wrote called , `` The Obesity Myth '' in the mid-2000s , which was motivated , you 've said before , by an interesting confluence of events , the Monica Lewinsky scandal and the use of the word zaftig in the public culture to describe her , all of which led you into a new field . How ? Yeah , I was a -- sounds improbable , but I was a -- I was doing a conference on the Clinton impeachment when it was taking place , and a speaker dropped out on me , and I had to fill in the gap in the program . </s>
And so I was looking at the media coverage of the Clinton impeachment to see if there was something interesting to say about it . And I did a lexis search , and I found that there were more than 100 news stories that used the phrase `` Monica Lewinsky '' and the word `` zaftig . '' </s>
And I was very struck by that , because , of course , as I have discovered in talking about this over the years , the vast majority of Americans do n't know what zaftig means . This audience probably has a relatively high percentage of people who know what that word means . But most Americans do n't . And yet Monica Lewinsky was being identified as both fat and Jewish , which I thought was kind of interesting by the use of that word . And so I started looking at the weight that -- the role that weight obsessionalism played in the Clinton impeachment . </s>
And here we are today . Thank you . And your -- your teammate , John Stossel , John Stossel , well known as a journalist , a gadfly , a libertarian , a contrarian and omnivore , I presume . A what ? Yes , yes . </s>
Omna . That might have been too personal . Relevant to this debate , John , you have likened those who would want to regulate the diet of Americans to the prohibitionists of the early 20th century , the moral being what ? That they mean well , but that they do more harm than good . All right . </s>
And it reminds me of what Mencken said , that they have the haunting fear that someone somewhere may be happy . Ladies and gentlemen , the team arguing against the motion . So our motion is obesity is the government 's business , and this is a debate . It 's a contest . </s>
At the end , there will be a winner and a loser . And you , our live audience here at the Skirball Center , will choose the winner . </s>
By the time the evening has ended , we will have asked you to vote twice ; once before the debate and once again at the end . And the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner . So let 's go to the preliminary vote . If you go to the keypad at your seat , our motion is , `` Obesity is the government 's business . '' </s>
If you agree with the motion , push number 1 . </s>
And if you disagree , push number 2 . And if you 're undecided , push number 3 . Ignore the other keys . And if you push the wrong button , just correct yourself , and the system will lock you in . </s>
And what we 're going to do is we 're going to hold the result that we just registered to the end of the debate . </s>
We 'll release the two numbers together , the starting number and then the concluding number . And as I said , we go in three rounds . So onto round one . </s>
Our motion is `` Obesity if the government 's business . '' In round 1 , the speakers speak uninterrupted for seven minutes each . And speaking first for the motion , `` Obesity if the Government 's Business , '' I 'd like to introduce the 16th surgeon general of the United States . He has also served as assistant secretary of health and as director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention , Dr. David Satcher . Thank you . </s>
Well , we contend that obesity is definitely the government 's business . My favorite story I think about policymakers is a story about a man who was traveling across the country in a hot air balloon , and at a certain point he realized that he was lost , he had no idea where he was , so he decided that he would lower the balloons and see if he could see some recognizable landmarks . </s>
So he lowered the balloon , could n't see anything that he recognized , no Golden Gate bridge , no Washington Monument , so he had no idea where he was . So he kept lowering the balloon , and when he got to about 30 feet above ground he saw a man working in the field . So he yelled out , `` Where am I ? '' and the man stopped digging in the field , and he said , `` Well , you 're in a hot air balloon about 30 feet above ground . '' Well , the man in the balloon said , `` You sound like a scientist . </s>
Do you work in science ? '' And the man on the ground said , `` My goodness , I am a scientist . But how in the world did you know that ? '' Said , `` Well , I knew that because what you told me is technically correct but it is of absolutely no use to me right now . '' Well , not to be outdone , the man on the ground said , `` Well , you sound like one of those policymakers from Washington or somewhere . '' And the man in the balloon said , `` I am . </s>
I 'm an outstanding policymaker . I 'm a leader . </s>
But how did you know that ? '' And the man on the ground said , `` I knew that because you 're in the same position you were when we met , you do n't know where you are , you do n't know where you 're going , and now you 're blaming me . '' Well , let me say that I spent nine years in government , five as director of the CDC , and as you 've heard , four as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health , and I have to tell you , I would trade nothing for those nine years . </s>
They were rich years . The people with whom I worked were special . So I am very excited about the role of government in dealing with a problem like obesity . Let me just say a few of the things I was involved in . In 1996 , while director of CDC , we released a very interesting report on physical activity . </s>
It was actually released as a surgeon general 's report , and basically what we showed in that report on physical activity was that there was a dramatic decline in physical activity among the American people , including schools no longer requiring physical education , K through 12 . And so we expressed a lot of concerns about the sedentary lifestyles of American people and the implications of that . In 1999 , I represented the United States at a world conference on health promotion and disease prevention . </s>
And at that conference for the first time I released the surgeon general 's Prescription , which I 'm sure many of you are familiar with , but among the things on that prescription was the recommendation for regular physical activity , at least 30 minutes a day , at least five days a week , but also a recommendation that the American people consume at least five servings of fruits and vegetables per day . There were other things on the prescription , even one having to do with mental health and the need to have some planned strategy for dealing with stress . </s>
We did n't really understand at that time the relationship between things like physical activity and depression , the fact that physical activity is a major intervention for reducing depression . Then in 2001 , as surgeon general and assistant secretary for health , I released the surgeon general 's Call to Action to Prevent and Reduce Overweight and Obesity . That report , among other things , pointed out that between 1980 and the year 2000 there had been a tripling of overweight and obesity among children in this country and a doubling among adults . So we did sound the alarm , and even though I was former director of the CDC and we are very selective at what we call `` epidemics , '' usually reserved for infectious diseases , we declared that overweight and obesity was an epidemic in this country . We did n't realize at that time that the same thing was beginning to happen all over the world . </s>
In that report of the surgeon general on overweight and obesity , we especially expressed concern about the changes in the maps throughout the country , where you could actually map the increase in overweight and obesity in various states , whereas in 1990 , 15 percent was almost the high . By the year 2001 , it was 25 to 30 percent of the American people who were obese . </s>
What we know about overweight and obesity from a population perspective is very important , I think , to this debate because what we know is that it has increased dramatically , but also that it is clearly associated with an increase in chronic diseases , especially what we call Type II diabetes , or increases in what we call BMI , the way we measure body fat , directly related to an increase in Type II diabetes . And , as you know , Type II diabetes increases the risk for cardiovascular disease and even renal disease . </s>
So we were concerned about what was happening in this country . We were concerned about the implication of these rising rates of overweight and obesity . We were also concerned about disparities . We have declared the goal of eliminating disparities in health in this country , especially among different racial and ethnic groups . And what we observed , of course , was that this epidemic was disproportionately impacting African Americans and American Indians . </s>
So , American Indians also have the highest rate of Type II diabetes . And African Americans have the highest mortality rates from Type II diabetes . So we were very concerned about the impact that this was having on eliminating disparities in health . </s>
We were also concerned about what was happening in children . I think this was really critical . What we found was that children , by increasing overweight and obesity , were now getting what we previously had called adult-onset diabetes . We were seeing it in children . </s>
We were seeing hypertension in children . Pediatricians were expressing great concerns . </s>
Dr. David Satcher , your time is up . Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you . Our motion is `` Obesity is the government’s business.” And here to speak against this motion , John Stossel . He is host of the Fox Business Network program , known as Stossel . He has received 19 Emmy Awards . </s>
And prior to joining Fox , he spent over two decades at 20/20 on ABC News as an anchor and a correspondent . Ladies and gentlemen , John Stossel . Thank you . </s>
I apologize for holding my hand up . I had hand surgery , and the doctor’s tell me hold it up so it doesn’t get inflamed , so I’m not saluting or doing anything weird like that . So , Dr. Satcher , I hear you and it’s a problem that people have less physical activity . And it would be good if we ate more fruits and vegetables . </s>
And it’s terrible that more people have diabetes , but obesity is the government’s business -- that’s a separate issue . It’s a powerful assumption in that , but behind it is the assumption that everything good should be encouraged by government and everything bad discouraged . And at first that sounds like common sense , but everything is arguably , to some degree , helpful or harmful . So , this is a formula for totalitarianism . I mean , why is totalitarianism if not the view that everything falls within the purview of the state ? </s>
Mussolini said that -- “everything within the state , nothing outside.” </s>
Okay , that’s over the top . I’m not saying that government is like a fascist regime , but it’s becoming just as invasive . </s>
It spent $ 3.8 trillion . It’s going broke . The philosopher Thomas Hobbes started using the term “Leviathan” to refer to a powerful central government to which we give up some rights . And he thought Leviathan was a good thing . But he assumed that its function was protecting us from violence . </s>
He never imagined that Leviathan would plan our meals . And the founders of this country never imagined that . They started the country with this . This is the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence . </s>
Together it’s this thin . </s>
This is what they thought we needed , and this is what made America prosperous . Now , this isn’t everything we should have . We need pollution control rules . They didn’t think about that . But government has gone much further . </s>
We now have an agriculture department that spends $ 145 billion a year . Government runs public housing , a war on drugs , a welfare state . It subsidizes farmers and , by doing that , does harm , as Robert Rosenkrantz said , making people fatter . </s>
It runs school lunches . It subsidizes students , Indians , researchers , volunteers , small businessmen , rich businessmen , polices the world and polices our home and our jobs , our bedrooms . And now food too ? Well , yes . </s>
But if it were n't already doing all -- trying to do all that stuff and doing it badly , it could better do what it 's supposed to , protect us from criminals and terrorists . And America would n't be going broke . But look , I have lost that argument . We libertarians have argued that we 're in the minority . </s>
I understand that . </s>
Most of you disagree . Most of you want more government . You like the minimum wage . You like the EEOC to protect us against discrimination , Title 9 to protect us against gender discrimination , rules against sexual harassment language being used in workplaces , the ADA to protect disabled people , laws against prostitution and online gambling . </s>
And in the name of health and safety , you support laws requiring motorcycle helmets and OSHA to protect the workers , and the CSPC to protect kids from dangerous toys , and the whole alphabet soup of agencies that keep growing in Washington . And my debate partner , Paul , he agrees with that . He says government ought to intervene in these areas . But even he says not obesity , because obesity is different , and government sucks at dealing with it . But he 's the obesity expert . </s>
I 'll let him explain that . </s>
All I know is that government keeps growing , and that is dangerous to our freedom . Now the president wants to spend another 300 million or so of your dollars to pay for his wife 's healthy foods financing initiative . And of course , that 's in addition to all the stuff we already have , the `` let 's move '' campaign , the task force on childhood obesity , the school lunch program , the council on fitness and so on . What 's the result of all that stuff ? Since they created it , they spent a lot of your money on it , people are fatter than ever . </s>
And that 's just what the Feds spend . The states and localities spend even more . I mean , New York City now bans bake sales in schools . How much has that helped ? My colleague , Mike Huckabee when he was governor of Arkansas , he required every school to measure every kid 's body mass index . </s>
Dr. Satcher mentioned that . It 's a measure based on the height-weight ratio . It 's a terrible measure . </s>
I mean , BMI index says that George Clooney and Tom Cruise are overweight and Arnold Schwarzenegger is obese . It just mismeasures people , but it 's required now in Arkansas . For every kid , they get a report card that does n't just give their arithmetic score . It tells the parents what their BMI index is . </s>
The result ? Well , I do n't think it 's helped them teach arithmetic because the teachers are distracted . But the kids are just as fat . It 's made no difference in obesity in the schools . </s>
Some states say , we ought to have some taxes , taxes on bad food . And intuitively , this makes sense . </s>
Let 's tax candy and , oh , then they 'll eat less candy . </s>
They 'll eat more fruits and vegetables . </s>
So Illinois did that . </s>
Six percent tax on candy . But what 's the result ? It 's just confusing . What is candy ? </s>
They decide , okay , a Hershey bar is candy , but a Kit Kat bar , that 's food because it 's got flower in it . So this enriches the bureaucrats and the lawyers , but it does n't help anybody lose weight . </s>
In New York City , the government requires calorie counts now to be posted in restaurants . And that makes sense . Information is good . So NYU did a study of that and found that , yes , adults say they were influenced by the calorie postings . But then they checked the receipts , and they found the people ordered slightly more calories . </s>
Government ca n't make us thinner . Government ca n't control our personal behavior in that way . And even if it could , we 're spending $ 3.8 trillion going broke . We could n't afford to do this even if it worked . </s>
We do n't need government to do this . There are only two ways to do things in life : voluntary or force . </s>
Government is force . We need some force to keep us safe . But voluntary is better . </s>
And voluntary abounds . </s>
We have plenty of diet information . All these diet websites , books on nutrition , TV shows like The Biggest Loser , diet gurus are celebrities . That 's enough . We do n't need government taking our money , and we do n't need government force . </s>
Thank you , John Stossel . So here 's where we are . We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan . </s>
We have four debaters arguing out this motion : `` Obesity is the government 's business . '' You have heard the first two debaters . And now to introduce our third . To debate in support of the motion that `` Obesity is the government 's business , '' here is WebMD 's chief lifestyle correspondent , a professor of medicine at the University of Maryland and former Pew Foundation scholar in nutrition and metabolism , Dr. Pamela Peeke . </s>
Obesity is the government 's business . You hear from the opposing side that we 're looking at a nanny state or food policing . Au contraire , that 's not what we 're looking for at all . Voluntary ? </s>
We give you voluntary . </s>
That 's what we 're looking for . I wear many hats . I 'm a physician first , and I hail from the front trenches , face to face with my patients and as chief lifestyle expert for WebMD 's 90 million members , click to click with my cyber folks . This is where I practice high-tech touch . </s>
I set up a discussion group asking , is obesity the government 's business ? It lit up like Kyoto at nighttime . It was fabulous . The bottom line was , yes , obesity is the government 's business for leadership , education , protection , options , opportunities , infrastructure . No sidewalk , no walk . </s>
No park , no play . No bike path , lots of accidents . Bottom line , what they said was , `` No blame , no shame . </s>
No tax , no bans . '' They drew a line in the sand . And Dr. Satcher and I agree with that . </s>
Obesity is the government 's business . </s>
I 'm going to flip now to my public health hat . Government can not solve the obesity problem alone . </s>
A problem as large as obesity , pun fully intended , requires all sectors of society to bring our thinking to the table . So I argue for government private sector partnerships . Should n't be just the government at all . </s>
When we initiate a voluntary campaign or an effort , we want to be able to offer people options and opportunities because if there is no choice , there can be no moderation . We 're in New York City . I love this place . </s>
And although you just heard that some of what you 're doing is n't working so well , I say , forget all that . You have programs here , for instance , Mayor Bloomberg has joined with 500 other mayors with the `` let 's move cities and town '' campaign to be able to work , drill down into the neighborhoods . </s>
What we can do to be able to improve physical activity as well as nutrition . In addition , the `` fresh '' program , food retailed expansion to support health programs . Say that three times . The food retail expansion to support health program has set up 14 supermarkets in food deserts . </s>
This was a private-public collaboration , a partnership that worked . We now have fresh produce out there . And that 's really important . Of course , we have so many other measures that have taken place . Good grief , we have play streets . </s>
We 've taken quiet streets and turned them into play yards because we have nothing else out there . </s>
We 're using what we can . </s>
We 're doing what we can . At the national level , obviously we 're looking at prevention now . The national prevention and health promotion strategy to stop disease before it starts . Million hearts campaign . </s>
Let 's Move actually celebrates its second anniversary this month alone . And it 's been reaching out to everyone from REI for outdoor , you know , to a beverage industry for clear on calories so you can begin to understand what 's going on in those labels . Is it perfect ? Absolutely not . </s>
Is it voluntary , and does it touch people 's lives ? </s>
Hell yeah . </s>
I 'm on the board of America on the Move , and we 're moving . We have corporate sponsors . </s>
We do private , public sponsorships all year long . We do this in neighborhoods , in states all across this country . We touch people . </s>
Exercise is Medicine , I am their national spokesperson , a collaboration of the American Medical Association as well as the American College of Sports Medicine . And here we see again trying to show people that there are simple , small steps , literally , that you can take to be able to help yourself , voluntary , nothing stuffed up your nose . </s>
We 're not going to the tax and ban place . We 're not food policing . We 're reaching out asking people to hold our hand and say , come on . We can do this together . Is it sloppy ? </s>
Yeah . Are we perfect ? </s>
No . We 're about as perfect as the people who create them and implement them . We 're human . We 're getting there . </s>
I 'm going to switch over to my last hat for my seven minutes as a researcher . Guess what ? The National Institutes of Health is public funding . </s>
$ 32 billion to save your lives , to do the work we do . It 's interesting , when I began my work there as a senior scientist , I went to the clinical director 's office , and above the office there was a sign that said , `` In God we trust , '' and there was a little sign below it that said , `` Everyone else must show data . '' Fairly straightforward . We wanted to see some good data here . </s>
And so in our laboratory we showed the connection between chronic stress for instance and the buildup of that toxic fat deep inside your belly which increases your risk for heart disease and diabetes . We showed for instance that it 's not about ELMM , `` Eat less , move more . '' That 's so important , however , so much bigger . </s>
We forgot the mind . </s>
What about stress ? New research has just been published showing that children who are stressed , and you know what that 's about , in their childhood , at home , at school , eat more , and that 's that stress-fat connection that we talk about so often . What are we doing about that ? </s>
We have a new science called , `` epigenetics , '' we 're trying to look at how we can literally change gene expression , how we turn on and off genes , by simply doing easy things like if I eat an apple every day on a regular basis I get that gene expression and therefore I 'm able to what ? Have an increased or decreased vulnerability toward obesity . </s>
Or I could just do what so many people do , that nocturnal ménage à trois every night , you know what I 'm talking about , you , Ben , and Jerry . All together in bed watching the tube , hanging out , doing it . Does n't work , all right ? What 's that gene expression looking like ? All right . </s>
So here we 're looking at something that 's a brand new phenomenon , something we love to call `` secondhand obesity . '' </s>
What we 're looking at is virally , families , what 's going on with them ? How are we touching kids ? It 's so much bigger than demonizing sugar . It 's so much bigger , so much bigger than saying the government 's just too fat . </s>
What we 're saying is , putting our hand out , we 're trying to say , `` Educate , bigger brain , better choices , obesity is the government 's business . '' Thank you , Pamela Peeke . And that is our motion , `` Obesity is the government 's business . '' And now here , our final debater against the motion , Paul Campos . He is professor of law at the University of Colorado in Boulder , and author of `` The Obesity Myth : Why America 's Obsession with Weight is Hazardous to Your Health . '' </s>
Thank you . I think that the fundamental difficulty here is that , despite the great courtesy of the organizers of this debate to invite me , I 'd like to start by pointing out that this debate is framed in completely the wrong way . To have a motion that says , `` Obesity is the government 's business , '' essentially begs the question because using the term `` obesity '' frames the debate as one which is about the supposedly pathological state of people who have a body mass index of about 30 if they 're obese or above 25 if they 're overweight . </s>
And that in itself essentially tells us that we ought to think about those states as being per se bad and in fact a diseased or a quasi-diseased state . Imagine if this debate were framed as , `` Eliminating body diversity is the government 's business . '' </s>
I think that would sound a lot different , but in point of fact there is really -- there is no practical distinction between those two motions . The assumptions at work here are that a narrow range of body weight is normal for human beings and that outside that range a variation is the product of poor lifestyle . Furthermore , it 's assumed in the framing of this issue that by reforming poor lifestyle either voluntarily or quasi coercively , you can eliminate abnormal body weight . This is all wrong . </s>
There 's nothing normal about normal body weight . </s>
It 's not normal statistically . It 's not normal epidemiologically . </s>
The overweight category of BMI 25 to 29.9 does not , in fact , feature increased overall health risk , so there is n't even a correlation there between increased health risk and the pathologizing of that body state . The vast majority of people , and I 'm going to say this about 27 times tonight , can not intentionally modify their body mass in a long term fashion successfully . </s>
There is no better established proposition empirically in all of medicine than that . </s>
In other words , people , as you all know -- well , I should n't say `` all of you , '' but many of you know from personal experience -- find it extraordinarily difficult to change their body weight in a significant long term way voluntarily . Government intervention in this area , and my partner , John Stossel is quite correct in saying that . In comparison to him , I am almost a Stalinist in my enthusiasm for government intervention , although I think he did overstate a couple of my positions . </s>
I won’t get into those because that’s beside the point . But in fact , even though I am generally enthusiastic about various forms of government regulation that fill him with dread , I am in fact utterly opposed to government regulation in this area because I think government -- the same as -- obesity as government’s business is almost a kind of dream scenario for a Libertarian . </s>
Because a Libertarian could not come up with a better example of government dysfunction than of the notion that we’re supposed to make people thinner , mainly because -- well , for a bunch of reasons , which I want to go through quickly right now and then come back to later . </s>
Here I want to emphasize first of all that we do not know an enormous number of things that we would have to know if we were going to have a rational policy that was based on the notion that we were going to make everybody have a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 , the so-called normal range , which for an average height woman would be between 108 and 144 pounds , outside of that supposedly pathological . </s>
Here’s what we don’t know . We don’t know how to produce significant long-term weight loss . We just don’t . We don’t know if such weight loss would be beneficial . This hypothesis has not been tested for the very good reason that since we don’t know how to produce it , we can’t test the hypothesis . </s>
We don’t know to what extent , if at all , the generally weak associations between obesity and increased health risk are products of a causal relationship as opposed to markers for other things like , for example , dieting , weight cycling , diet drug use , eating disorders , stress , stigma , and lower socioeconomic status . We don’t know why weight went up among Americans in the 1980s and ‘90s . We don’t know why it was stable in the 1960s and ‘70s . </s>
We don’t know why it has plateaued over the course of the last 10 years . We don’t in fact know whether people are more sedentary today than they were 40 years ago . We just don’t have the data on that . We just have a few very indirect markers for that , such as the amount of mandatory gym periods in school , but we don’t have any direct measurement of how active people were 40 years ago . We don’t know whether people consume more calories today than they did 40 years ago . </s>
Again , the data is not available . People often -- you know , when that’s pointed out to them rather rudely by someone like me , the reaction of public health officials tends to be something like , “Well , it’s just common sense , ” right . But see , common sense is what you invoke when you don’t have data , right . </s>
That’s why we have these academic institutions , right , so that we don’t just rely on common sense . We actually try to have some evidence for our propositions . </s>
Here’s what we do know . We do know that public health interventions designed to produce weight loss do not produce weight loss . </s>
This hypothesis has been tested . </s>
It’s been tested in situations where we have had intense public health intermediations that are much more intense than those that we could produce on a population-wide scale . And those interventions do not produce weight loss , either in adults or children . We do know that labeling bodies as diseased is stigmatizing , and we know that stigma is very bad for health , as are stress , weight cycling , and eating disorders , which are other things that are produced by this kind of labeling . We do know that risk factors that are associated with obesity , like , for instance , hypertension , can be addressed cheaply and successfully through inexpensive drugs that work quite well and increased physical activity , which is beneficial for people of all shapes and sizes whether in fact it produces any weight loss , which it usually doesn’t . </s>
Finally , what I really would want to emphasize here above all is that healthy lifestyles don’t eliminate body diversity , which is found among people with a wide variety of body types , many of whom fall outside the phony , so-called normal range . And so , what I would advocate more than anything else is that we ought to focus on a harm reduction , not weight reduction . We’ve already had some indications tonight of the notion that we don’t want to stress people . </s>
Here’s a suggestion . Stop telling them that their bodies are pathological because that’s very stressful . </s>
That’s not good for people . And if you say that you don’t want to stigmatize obese people but you just want to stigmatize obesity , I would suggest that that is a protocol that’s not going to be successful . Thank you . Thank you , Paul Campos . </s>
And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Square U.S. debate . And remember , we had you vote in the beginning , and we’re going to ask you to vote again at the end . And the team whose numbers have changed the most will be declared our winner . Now , onto round two where the debaters will address each other directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience and from Slate readers who have submitted questions and from people watching on ForaTV , we have two teams of two here arguing out this motion : `` Obesity is the government 's business . '' On one side , arguing in support of this motion , David Satcher and Pamela Peeke . </s>
They are arguing that we have a national emergency underway , a record of weight gain among Americans that threatens to bankrupt the health care system and to break the health of those who are obese , but they also offer hope in the role of government as -- in its ability to offer leadership and protection and infrastructure in support of the actions of those individuals who do want to lose weight . The side arguing against includes John Stossel and Paul Campos . </s>
They are arguing in a two-pronged attack . One is , they 're basically saying the research is wrong that says that obesity is killing us . And the research is wrong that suggests that we even know how to lose weight . They 're also saying basically that whenever Uncle Sam attempts to govern the health of an individual , Uncle Sam always gets it wrong . So there 's a lot to talk about there and a lot to explore . </s>
And I want to go first to the side arguing in support of the motion . What your opponents have left hanging out there repeatedly is the notion that government 's track record already is terrible , that over the last 20 years , 30 years , as government programs have been put into place , we 've just gotten heavier . </s>
So take that on . What -- what is the evidence that in fact government can have an impact on obesity of individuals ? David Satcher . Well , I think the evidence is related to several things . </s>
First , we had a very interesting study funded by NIH in the late '90s , early part of this 2000 . And basically showed that if we could get people to be physically active and to change their diet , even if they lost only five to 15 percent of their weight , we could dramatically decrease the risk for diabetes , in fact almost 60 percent reduction among African- Americans and American Indians in the onset of Type II diabetes , by getting people to change their lifestyles and to be more physically active and to consume diets with less saturated fats and sugars . So I think we do know , from that study , that it 's possible to help people change lifestyles . </s>
And I did say help because Pamela is correct , there are a lot of people in this country who do not have access to healthy lifestyles . And it is in fact a responsibility of government to make sure that everybody has the opportunity , everybody has access to the opportunity for healthy lifestyles . But the point of the question goes not just to the theory behind it , but the track record of the government . The track record that I mentioned was the one dealing with African-Americans and American Indians in terms of reducing -- </s>
Okay . -- the risk for diabetes mellitus . Let me go to the other side . </s>
Paul Campos , would you like to respond ? </s>
Yes . In fact in that study -- Paul , can you move just a touch closer to your mic ? Yes , right . And it 's a study that Dr. Satcher was citing there , there was an average of 2.3 kilograms of weight loss , which is about four pounds . </s>
The difficulty with citations to the notion that a small amount of weight loss is going to greatly reduce the risk of Type II diabetes is that a couple things , one , you ca n't -- you can not disentangle the amount of weight loss that is produced , which is generally quite small , from the beneficial effect of the lifestyle intervention . The way that you would want to test that , to say , well , let 's look at the people who 've lost weight and compare them to the people who did n't lose weight if they all engage in the same lifestyle intervention . Is there a dose response that is related to the weight loss ? </s>
And the answer is no , there is n't . In those studies , the people who engaged in the same lifestyle changes but did n't lose weight had the same reduction , on average , in Type II diabetes risk as people who engaged in the lifestyle changes and did in fact lose some weight . So to me , that 's really compelling evidence for the notion that focusing on weight in that context does n't make any sense . I 'm all for focusing on , you know , lifestyle changes . </s>
I think it 's good to encourage people to be physically active . But there 's a lot of evidence that physical activity in and of itself is beneficial . But what there 's not evidence of is that either physical activity changes are going to produce significant long-term weight loss . Again , they do n't in the vast majority of people , or secondly , that the weight loss is necessary for the purposes of getting the benefits of the increase in the -- </s>
Okay . -- in the activity levels . I want to go to Pamela Peeke . You 're on the side with the two doctors . Your opponents are basically saying -- they 're blowing up conventional wisdom here -- </s>
Mm-hmm . </s>
-- by saying this -- you 're not quite saying it , but you 're suggesting , Paul , that there 's not a whole lot of point in reducing your calories and exercising more if your goal is to lose weight . And that just flies in the face of everything that even you stand for in your work , Pamela . </s>
So take that on . I will be more than happy to take that on . Apparently Paul is not aware of the national weight control registry . This is an ongoing study , almost 20 years old , which has been sponsored by the University of Colorado as well as Brown University , my colleagues , Dr. James Hill and Rena Wing . </s>
The cohort right now is over 10,000 people , including people who have bariatric surgery as well . </s>
And these people are known as the successful losers . </s>
And actually , Paul , you actually are too , because of your own weight loss as you noted in your book . You qualify because you had to have dropped at least 30 pounds and kept it off for at least a year . And the grand majority of these people have kept off approximately 60 pounds for almost six years or longer . And this is on the average in a very large cohort . </s>
So are these mutants ? Freaks ? What are they ? These people have determined that they will keep this weight off by utilizing very simple things . And this has been published in extensive literature . </s>
One of the most interesting things we found was that the number one predictor for being able to keep weight off and do this well is to have a healthy breakfast every morning . They are physically active . Are they part of the Olympic camp ? No . </s>
They basically get out . And the number one favorite thing to do is walk . And in most of the government interventions , all we 're asking people to do is not drop weight so much . </s>
That 's not where we 're going . </s>
Losing weight , I 'm a physician . People lose weight and do really stupid things to lose weight . That 's not where we 're going . So you 're talking -- </s>
We 're going to health . You 're talking -- </s>
We 're going to health , and we 're going to fitness . Pamela . And that 's what we saw in this study . So you 're emphasizing information , encouragement and education . Absolutely . </s>
I want to ask John Stossel , what 's wrong with the government through schools emphasizing education information and encouragement ? Because Pamela said that 's all voluntary and talked about public-private partnerships being voluntary . But government is n't voluntary . </s>
It said we have a voluntary tax system . </s>
But try not paying your taxes and see if it 's voluntary . Men with guns will come and make you pay for the dumb programs that they keep creating that do n't work and that Paul says make people miserable . And keep growing . But John , what would be the harm of -- of spending money in a school to put this on the curriculum and keep it on the curriculum ? </s>
Because the schools can barely teach reading , writing and arithmetic . David Satcher . Well , I think a couple of things . The goal of these programs is to help children develop lifetime habits of physical activity and good nutrition . We also know , by the way , that children who develop good eating habits and regular physical activity do better academically . </s>
They perform better on standardized exams in math and reading . They are more disciplined in school . So the benefits of healthy lifestyles go far beyond losing weight . Now , Paul quoted the statistics about weight loss versus decrease in diabetes . </s>
The goal is to decrease fat . And sometimes you can decrease fat and increase muscle and not lose weight . </s>
But you still reduce the risk of diabetes . I think you know that as a runner . So let them learn that from Pamela 's TV show and from Richard Simmons . We do n't need government . </s>
Excuse -- Here 's the problem . Pamela Peeke . </s>
Yeah , that 's nice for people who do have cable TV . Unfortunately , many people do n't have Discovery Channel . </s>
So for those poor people out there who have no access , what are you going to do ? </s>
You just assume they 're going to catch it on the tube . Oh , no . You 're not supposed to be watching TV because if you watch TV too long , you get this big . So , I mean , you 're going round and round . Why not just sit there ? </s>
Why not do what Alice Waters did in Berkeley , the Martin Luther King middle school ? She built a garden . She had the kids grow stuff . All right . Paul Campos . </s>
Kids who grow and eat it . Paul Campos . Again , just -- Well , I just -- I love Alice Waters ' cooking , I 'll tell you . I think it 's awesome . </s>
But I think her social policy is rather questionable because she wants everybody to be like they 're an upper class white woman in Berkeley . And that 's just not going to happen , right , for all kinds of reasons . Now , what I 'm going to emphasize here is that the government 's theory seems to be something along the lines of , people are fat because they have not been given the information that it is more desirable in this culture to be thin rather than to be fat . </s>
I do n't think that 's correct . I think this information is -- is not exactly a state secret . It 's been widely disseminated . Well , let 's be clear , though . David Satcher . </s>
It 's not the information . It 's the opportunity to act on it . </s>
I think what Pamela described in terms of in the inner cities of the country—you do n't have sidewalks , you do n't have safe places to be physically active , you do n't have access to grocery stores , so what you 're talking about is the opportunity -- </s>
That 's absolutely right . -- to leave -- Tell me the government 's role in creating those opportunities . Are you literally talking about building sidewalks , -- Yeah , in some -- </s>
The government -- Look at what Louisville did . It changed the zoning laws so that within so much area you had to have grocery stores and you had to have parks and playgrounds , so the government can , in fact , produce the opportunities for people to have access . </s>
Did people lose weight in Louisville when that happened ? Well , I think it 's too soon to say they lost weight but they clearly increased healthy lifestyle , but , believe me , the fixation on weight is not ours . Oh , really ? The fixation here is on healthy lifestyles . </s>
What was your report called , Dr. Satcher , your 2001 report ? </s>
Was it a report on healthy lifestyles ? </s>
No , the first ever surgeon general 's report was on smoking and health and it was on cancer , but that was n't the focus . The focus was on getting people to stop smoking . Absolutely . So are you in favor of getting people to stop eating ? Getting people to stop -- getting people to eat -- to engage in healthy lifestyles . </s>
Well , I 'm all for engaging in healthy lifestyles , but I 'd like to point out that -- That 's the role of government . -- one of the most interesting things about this debate is that if you had a time capsule , everything that 's being said by the advocates of the government 's position here was said almost literally word for word in the 1950s . Remember -- some of you may remember -- President John Kennedy -- I do n't remember it actually , but I 've read about it -- initiative for the president 's council on physical fitness , right ? I remember that . </s>
John remembers it , right ? </s>
I remember that , you had to throw a softball 100 yards and do pushups -- </s>
That 's right , all that kind of thing , you know , that we 're all for , and , you know , for being healthy in that way . John Kennedy was actually a wreck physically but they hid that quite successfully at the time because -- but anyways , that 's another story . The thing is , it 's really striking , if you looked at the literature , the government officials were saying in the 1950s the same thing they 're saying today , they 're saying , `` Americans are getting horribly fat , and it 's going to cause this huge health crisis , and if we do n't do something about it , the Russians are going to just come in and push us over and takeover -- '' `` -- and it 's , you know , the terrorists within , '' and all that stuff , and nothing that was ever predicted took place . But this is one area I have found in terms of government policy and social hysteria and moral panic where data simply does n't move anything because people have such a fixation with the desirability of weight loss that you can talk all you want about how we ought to have healthier lifestyles , but what people really want to do is make people thin . All right . </s>
No , we do n't want to make people thin . </s>
Pamela for just one second . We do n't want to make people thin . </s>
And I do n't know where this came from . Apparently there 's a fantasy land going on over there . </s>
`` Thin '' is a four-letter word , okay ? </s>
I do n't know what it means . All we care about is healthy and fit . Come on . Let 's get real here for a minute . </s>
Fifty years ago , if you were 10 or 15 pounds overweight it was a crisis , you know , you could n't get out of your size four , whatever . Today I 'm a physician and I do n't make fun of this stuff . I 'm a compassionate physician because I have people sitting in front of me and they 're in pain . And do you know what ? </s>
They do n't have 15 to 20 pounds to drop . They have 100 and 150 . It 's changed . It 's changed from 1950 . </s>
And I 'll tell you what , they 'll never get within spitting distance of an ideal body weight , so you know what I do today ? I 've changed the game . I think it 's head south , just start moving down , five percent , 10 percent , pick up healthy lifestyles , small steps here . </s>
That 's all you need to do . But , Pamela , what does that have to do -- what does that have to do with the government 's being -- It has everything to do with the government -- Make the case . -- because they do n't have resources . </s>
Where are the play yards ? Where are the parks ? Where are the bike paths ? Okay . </s>
Let me take that to John Stossel . Let me just take that to John Stossel . </s>
I just want to say , though -- We have n't heard from him . All right , go ahead , very quickly . It would be very interesting to find these studies that Paul is quoting saying that obesity was a major problem in the '50s . There 's no such study . </s>
We looked at every -- </s>
Forty percent of the American population was , quote , unquote , `` overweight , '' in 1958 , 40 percent , so apparently if there 's been an epidemic , we 've had an epidemic for a long time . But overweight -- I want to be clear about `` overweight , '' because I know you 've written , saying that people who are overweight are healthier . Many people who are overweight are athletes who are muscular or people who work out , so we admit it in our books , we acknowledge that the BMI is not reliable in people who are muscular , who are athletes , and who work out . So I think that 's a distortion . </s>
John Stossel , I 've been asking the other side for specifics on what the government can do . They 're talking about building parks , playgrounds , sidewalks , to give people the chance to get physically fit , particularly in communities where we know those things are at a deficit . Take that on . My understanding is that there are just as many or more parks , playgrounds and sidewalks as there have ever been . </s>
People can exercise if they wanted to . And John , you talked about they’re responding to this national emergency . That’s the justification for government , and I think you’re right . And that always is . The crisis is the friend of the state . </s>
But there -- the specialists always have emergencies . </s>
It’s terrorism or global warming or Y2K . Remember , the planes were all going to crash , and the killer bees were coming up from Mexico , were going to sting us all to death , and Bird Flu and plastic bottles . It’s endless . It all requires government to intervene , to raise your taxes and to limit your freedom . </s>
Pamela Peeke . John says there’s plenty of sidewalks and parks . </s>
John . John , where the hell do you live ? Right here in New York City . Honey , listen , get out of New York -- get out of New York and live , right . </s>
Go out to the hinterland . Go out to places where people don’t have these -- The hinterland is one big park . </s>
Very seriously , John . I mean , really , what we’re looking at is the ability to be able to give people options . We keep telling people to go out and do whatever . </s>
Eat less , move more . You give them food deserts . </s>
You don’t give them anywhere to move that’s safe . And then what do you have ? Where is that obesity ? Do I see a lot of obesity out here ? I don’t think so . </s>
Again , go to the hinterland . John , keep looking . It’s up there somewhere . </s>
You don’t have to go to the hinterland . There are many areas in this city and surrounding cities where it’s not safe to get out and walk in the street . It’s not safe . There’s no safe place . It’s safer than it used to be . </s>
Crime is down . I’m sorry . It’s safer than it used to be . Crime is down . </s>
And obesity is up . And it’s down in great part because of the same leadership that’s now saying that we’ve got to change the way we direct food to people . I want to move a little -- We’ve got to intervene to make sure that people know what they’re eating . I want to move to another part of the argument that Paul Campos has put out there , where he’s basically challenging the scientific underpinnings of the argument that you’re making . </s>
I mean , Dr. Satcher , you said that you’ve talked about -- you’ve discussed the association between obesity and diabetes . </s>
You didn’t -- causation -- you said an association . But Paul Campos , you’re saying that even that association doesn’t exist . No , the association exists , but the relationship is complex , right . I mean , the notion -- do we know that diabetes causes obesity ? How do we know that obesity doesn’t cause diabetes ? </s>
Do we know ? Right , we -- in other words -- We don’t know -- we don’t know the cause of breast cancer . That doesn’t mean we don’t screen for it . </s>
We do know the association . </s>
Well , yeah , but David , I don’t think -- In public health , we deal with associations . Do you want to just perform mastectomies on women who don’t have breast cancer so they can avoid getting breast cancer ? I don’t get the connection . </s>
The connection is -- Okay , Paul , Paul . Pamela Peeke . Whoah , whoah , whoah , whoah , whoah . </s>
In our laboratory , in the laboratories of many of our esteemed colleagues around the country , we’ve made it very clear that excessive visceral adiposity , a lot of fat deep inside your belly , is highly associated with a pro- inflammatory state , which increases the risk of diabetes , coronary vascular disease and cancer , period . I have that much literature to back up . Yes , that’s right . And you know what ? You can get rid of visceral body fat -- </s>
Paul , let her finish . In addition , Paul , the information that you presented showing that overweight is okay by me is actually wrong . </s>
And that has been refuted by at least two pooled meta- analyses publishes in Lancet and the New England Journal of Medicine by my colleague , Dr. Walter Willett from Harvard and by leading epidemiologists around this country basically refuting your -- Okay , let’s -- great . Paul , go ahead . Yeah , well , first of all , visceral body fat can be very effectively dealt with through changes in activity levels . </s>
It’s not going to -- But are you conceding that there’s a relationship between visceral body fat and -- </s>
There is a correlation between visceral body fat and increased health risks . That’s quite true , but the notion -- look , again , I want to emphasize the willingness to talk out of both sides of the mouth on this issue is just astonishing to me . </s>
You have people coming here and say obesity , obesity , obesity , right . We have this huge crisis . And then I point out this is a bunch of nonsense . And then it gets flipped around into , “Well , we’re not really talking about obesity . We’re talking about lifestyle.” </s>
This isn’t called , you know , “Is lifestyle the government’s business ? ” This doesn’t have a picture of a lifestyle on the front of it , right . </s>
David Satcher . It has a picture of a -- </s>
Come on , just wait a moment . David Satcher . </s>
Now , let’s be fair . Obesity is an outcome , in many cases , of unhealthy lifestyles . </s>
It’s not that simple . </s>
We differ in terms of metabolism . </s>
There’re some people who can eat a lot of calories and not gain a lot of weight . There are other people who gain weight easily . So everybody’s not equal . We’re not stigmatizing people who are obese . Read the surgeon general 's report , clearly says this is not about appearances . </s>
It 's about health . And the way to improve health is to change lifestyles . </s>
That 's what the report says . All right . I 'd like to go to the audience for some questions now . And reminding you of the point I made earlier . </s>
We 'd like you to be terse , on point , a question that leads us to the discussion of government involvement with this issue of obesity and to really make it a question . And there 's a gentleman right in the middle . Yep . </s>
I pointed to you . And if you can stand and state your name , and try to follow the rules . </s>
My name is Mel Zolkins . First , one sentence statement . The function of our government -- one of the functions is to promote the general welfare , unquote . So now the one sentence question to Mr. Stossel is , what does that mean to you ? </s>
Wait . Wait , wait , wait . Wait . </s>
Wait . Stand up . I -- I 'd like you to -- we can get John Stossel going way off on this one . </s>
And I 'd like you to focus that question more to the topic if you can . And I think you can probably do it with four or five words . So give it another shot . I 'll leave that up to you . All right . </s>
You know what I have in mind , obviously . All right . But it would be so charming if you said it . You can say it better . John Stossel , the gentleman is asking whether you feel that the government 's responsibility for the social welfare includes the health of the individual . </s>
Do you -- and your opponents have talked about the enormous amount of government money that 's spent on funding research that is saving people 's lives . That costs money . That 's taxes . Looks like it has a benefit . </s>
Is that the government 's business ? Well , they mention the NIH and basic research . And there is a better argument to be made that that does promote the general welfare . </s>
But if the general welfare means the obesity police or the lifestyle police , then there is no limit to what government can do . Then they can reach into every crevice of your life . They can ban the dinner you 're about to have . They can ban fat -- John , really ? </s>
-- and ice cream . I mean -- I need -- this as a neutral journalist . I need to know what you 're talking about when you talk about the -- </s>
You used to work at ABC . You ca n't be a neutral journalist . Sorry . I know . </s>
I know , I need to be more fair and balanced , John . But -- John , I just want to know , when you 're talking about these police telling us what we can eat for dinner , where is this -- you know , I know you 're talking about a slippery slope . I can see that . But where -- be more detailed about this fear . I mean , where do you see this happening ? </s>
You 're talking about in terms of -- the discussion of soda taxes , issues like that . Is that what you 're talking about happening ? </s>
Well , that 's part of it . </s>
I mean , Thomas Jefferson said it 's the natural progress of things for government to grow and liberty to yield . </s>
Government always grows . It starts with information . It moves to taxes . Then it moves to limits on what you can consume . </s>
And now that we have Obama care and the government says we 're going to pay for your health care , then that 's an argument to say , we have the right to have exercise police come into your home and make you improve your lifestyle . </s>
You start off by quoting -- David Satcher . -- Lincoln , so I 'll quote Lincoln who said that it is the role of government to do for people what they can not do for themselves . And that 's what we 're talking about here . People ca n't lose weight for themselves ? </s>
Not if they do n't have safe places to be physically active , not if they do n't have access to fresh fruits and vegetables . And they ca n't be biggest loser because they do n't own a TV . Another question from the audience . </s>
Well , that 's going to be helpful . Sir ? Oh , I meant a little farther back . </s>
Striped sweater . Thanks . If you do n't mind stating your name . </s>
My name is Noam Gerber . And I was curious how would you respond to the idea that the government 's role is to protect the collective rights of the citizens which overarches the protection of every one of our individual rights , and that the increase in obesity which represents that bridge represents a threat to our society , for example , the increase in rising costs of Medicaid which we all have to put a -- which we all have to contribute to . </s>
Okay . So I want to say that John really just answered the first part of your question , I think in terms of overall responsibility . But you 're asking about whether -- whether in fact we 're looking at a cost benefit between obesity on the one hand and the costs of treating people who would be ill with the diseases that this side is talking about . Am I right ? So I want to take that to Paul Campos . </s>
Well , couple things . </s>
First of all , if you 're concerned about rising medical costs , which you would be in favor of if you believe that obesity kills people , then much obesity is possible because what drives medical care costs through the roof is an aging population , all right ? That 's where the health care costs get spent , right ? In an elderly population , supposedly obese people are all going to die before they get to be old , right , which is , of course , nonsense . But if you really did believe that , that 's what would drive down health care costs . </s>
Secondly , and I think more fundamentally -- and I just want to repeat this again . We can not make fat people thin , okay ? So even if it was desirable from a social perspective to produce a society that did not have a lot of fat people in it , you can not do that in a developed economy , right ? We have a situation in this country where we somehow got it into our heads that everybody can be within a certain narrow range of body mass if they have a healthy lifestyle . That 's -- there 's absolutely no reason for believing that that 's true or that it 's in any way necessary . </s>
So I mean , I 'll tell you what , you know what really would reduce health care costs more than anything else ? I can do a back of the envelope calculation right now . </s>
We can reduce healthcare costs by $ 1.7 trillion a year out of the 1.9 trillion that we spend by just having everybody be between the ages of 20 and 29 . </s>
That would drive health care costs down to the floor , right ? </s>
But nobody is suggesting that we do that . </s>
And this is the same thing . It 's suggesting that we have a population that is going to be completely above -- Okay . Both your opponents want to speak . That 's a great question -- </s>
David -- David Satcher . -- that you raise . Let me just say that 80 percent of Medicare costs -- and Medicare is the most expensive program that government supports in terms of health . 80 percent of their costs are due to preventable diseases . </s>
And certainly , half of that is related to obesity and Type II diabetes . There 's no question about it . So it is true that the government has a self-interest to try to help people to develop healthy lifestyles . And we 're not even talking about obesity . </s>
We 're talking about the benefits of healthy lifestyles generally . Less diabetes mellitus , which is a major driver of costs of Medicare and other health programs . Can we quit saying that we 're trying to aim for turning fat people into thin people ? This is -- just end it now , please . </s>
Well , Pamela -- This is ridiculous . </s>
But Pamela -- </s>
We 're going for healthy , and we 're going for fit . We do n't want life spans . We want health spans . We want the highest quality of life we can have . And if you started out at 250 pounds , and you 're a 5'4 '' woman , and right now you 're 180 and a happy camper , God bless you . </s>
So long as you 're fit and happy . And we 're also forgetting the head in this whole thing too . We 're not science fair projects here . We forgot our heads . </s>
The stress factor here , of course we talked about stigma . No one wants to stigmatize . I 'm a physician . I see this every day . I feel that pain and that -- and I feel that compassion as I try to help someone go south from 250 or whatever . </s>
What we 're going for is health -- </s>
Okay . </s>
-- and fitness . All right . I 'm going to stop you because I think you made your point on that . No , no , no . </s>
I -- I did n't mean that at all that way . I was going to ask for clarification . What are you looking for when you say it 's not to get from heavy to thin , and you did answer it . In the third row here , just down front . Hello . </s>
My name is Jennifer Sogus . I 'm an urban planner , and public health researcher here in New York City at transportation alternative . And I come from a school of thought that I appreciate Dr. Peeke that you spoke to a play street such as one of my signature programs at Transportation Alternative . I come from a school of thought that has proven that when people do not have access to playgrounds and sidewalks and bike lanes , that they are less physically active and that they are more overweight . So my question pertains to a particular piece of legislation on the table right now around transportation funding which , as written , prohibits federal funding from being spent on walking and biking and transit infrastructure . </s>
So my question to all of the panelists is , what is the role of government in funding or not funding things that encourage or discourage people from being physically active ? I 'd like John Stossel to take it on first . I do n't understand what you 're talking about . The highway trust fund is already taken from drivers who pay the gas tax . </s>
And something like 20 percent of it is used for things like bike paths . </s>
So it 's already being spent on these things . Our government is spending $ 3.8 trillion . You want them to build grocery stores now ? I mean , government ca n't even count the votes accurately , and you want them to fix lifestyle problems ? </s>
This is a mistake . Let 's go to David Satcher . Well , I think we ought to be clear . </s>
You know , we are the government , and it is the role of government to create the conditions in which people can be healthy . That 's how we define public health . That 's how the Institute of Medicine defines public health . It is the role of public health to create the condition . </s>
It 's a collective effort to create the conditions in which people can be healthy . And that 's what we 're talking about . But are n't there more opportunities to be healthy now than ever before ? </s>
Per capita income , a bicycle is cheaper than it used to be . </s>
There are more soccer leagues than there ever used to be . </s>
There 's more awareness of physical activity . Oh , I 'm so sorry , did you forget about the fact that in the grand majority of schools across this country physical education is all but eliminated , it 's gone ? Well , let 's get rid of government schools -- And so we have -- -- and we 'll have better school . </s>
-- and then in addition , John , in addition , John , for soccer , I 'm sorry , that costs money . You have to have money to buy those soccer clothes . You have to have money to join the league . And those kids do n't have it . So let 's just see now . </s>
We eliminated recess . </s>
We do n't have physical education . And now we do n't have after school . And where do they go ? </s>
To the tube , they just sit there . I just have to disagree -- </s>
-- New York City any kid can join a soccer league and if he does n't have money the equipment will be given free . There 's plenty of charities around to pay for that . Let me remind you that schools are supposed to be the great equalizers in this country . In other words , kids come to school , some of them come from communities where they have adequate places to play , access to fresh fruits and vegetables . </s>
Other children come from homes where there 's no place to play safely , no access to fresh fruits and vegetables . </s>
At school at least they should be helped in developing lifetime habits of physical activity and good nutrition . I want to go to another question , but I want to tell folks who are in the darker area that I ca n't see you and the same is true on the sides , so if you want to ask a question you might take a stroll down toward the front . In the -- I 'm pointing -- yeah , yeah . </s>
Hi , I 'm Chandra Turner . We 've talked a lot about healthy lifestyle , but what I want to know is what is the government 's role beyond just promoting this healthy lifestyle that we 've all kind of anecdotally realized that is n't working , what about the government 's role in junk food in schools ? What about the government 's role -- -- in taxing foods ? </s>
Okay . What about the government 's role in -- what 's the other thing -- Labeling products ? -- the fast food industry -- </s>
Yeah . -- the packaged food industry , the -- all of the junk that our kids are getting constantly ? </s>
What is the role there ? </s>
We have n't talked about that at all . Can I ask you a specific -- -- suggest -- I mean , a specific recommendation you would want to see , for example , with junk food , would you want to ban it ? </s>
Would you want to label it ? </s>
Would you want to tax it ? Would you want to change the formulation ? Forced by the government ? Which of those things are you talking about ? Kind of all of the above . </s>
Okay , I want to -- -- I want to ask -- -- seriously -- John Stossel , you 're going to get your chance . -- I mean , I -- when I think about the role of government , that 's what I want to know , all the things that have n't been done yet . </s>
Yeah , okay . What can be done , and what is the government 's role in that ? </s>
David Satcher . </s>
Yeah , I think it 's an excellent question . The government 's role can be put into three categories . </s>
One is this assessment where you really monitor the health of the population , and you give us this kind of information that we can act on . The second one is assurance that everybody has access to the opportunity to lead healthy lifestyles . The third one is policy . And you 're right , it is the responsibility of government to develop guidelines for healthy eating . The Nutrition Act that 's just passed is an effort to say , `` If we 're going to have free breakfast , free lunch in the schools for 40 to 50 percent of the children , we must make sure that those lunches are healthy , that they have adequate fruits and vegetables , '' I agree with you . </s>
The third role of government is policy development , and that policy is made in such a way as to make sure , number one , we have the information that we need , we’ve got to have labels on the foods so we know what we 're getting , and also you 've got to make sure the children who are receiving these lunches are getting healthy foods . Okay -- That is the role of government . I want to let the other side respond to that , but I want to take a quick break -- artificial break for radio -- which will take all of eight seconds . And then I 'm going to raise my hand and ask you to applaud . </s>
And that 'll be the atmospheric moment in the radio broadcast and it 'll be chance for all of your hands to be heard by the nation . So if you could do that , I 'd appreciate it , just a round of applause . Thank you . We are back at this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan . Our motion is `` Obesity is the government 's business . '' We have heard the side arguing for the motion just recently make the case the government does have a very activist role to play in affecting and amending what people eat , in particularly , children . I want to let the other side respond to that argument . John Stossel . </s>
Dr. Satcher , I think you 're confusing intention with results . It 's nice that we have this good intention , but government does n't get the results . </s>
Some schools now have banned vending machines . A University of Pennsylvania study -- banned vending machines that sell unhealthy food . They studied it . They found the kids eat just as much junk food , no difference in weight loss . You earlier said that , you know , the schools are supposed to be the great equalizer . </s>
They are supposed to be , but government schools are more segregated than private schools . It doesn’t work . </s>
Government fails . David Satcher . Well , well , I don’t agree that governments fail . Now , the study that you’re talking about , I don’t think anyone , even the ones who carried it out would see that as a conclusive study . What they said was to date , we don’t see the evidence that changing the vending machines -- </s>
We’re going to keep doing more of it . We are going to keep working to help children develop lifetime habits of good nutrition and physical activity . I think that’s our responsibility . And that’s what the schools have to do . Paul Campos , arguing against the motion . </s>
There -- I mean , I think there’s a major misunderstanding here about the way that society works in regard to the things that people eat and how many calories they have . I mean , I’ve just spent the last three days on the upper west side of New York , and I’m surrounded by nothing but the most incredibly high caloric food that you can imagine , which , thanks to the neuroses of your mayor , are now made evident to me every time that I walk into a store because it says right there how many calories there are . And so I go into this place where it’s filled 100 percent by upper class white people looking at these little cupcakes that have 545 calories in them , so it’s like a nuclear bomb of calories , right . But is that going to cause obesity in that group ? No . Guess why ? </s>
Because they’re going to , you know , buy it and then slice it into eight little pieces and then eat it in a super neurotic way and then go to the yoga studio for two hours , right . Now , the notion that that kind of a social structure can be altered through these kinds of informational government interventions is just -- again , there’s no data to back it up . Now , I understand the theory that if something hasn’t worked , you can keep doing it until it does work , right . That -- one of the classic , you know , definitions of insanity , but that seems to be the government program here . Again , do you think -- </s>
All right , let’s let Pamel -- Let’s let Pamela Peeke -- oh , David Satcher . David Satcher . </s>
It’s amazing that the same thing was said about tobacco , the effort to get people to stop smoking , you know . Go back to the ’60s and the ‘70s . It’s not working . There’s no evidence . To date , we can point to millions and millions of peoples whose lives have been saved because of the efforts to get people to quit smoking . </s>
Smoking is a behavior . Obesity is not a behavior . You’re wrong , wrong , absolutely wrong . </s>
Oh , absolutely wrong ? Is that why -- tell me , Pam . </s>
Tell me , Pam , why are people fat ? Why are people fat ? Was it magic ? </s>
It was behavior . Because I’m a upper-class white person who has the privilege of modifying my weight to an extent that most people don’t . </s>
And you cut your cupcake into 13 pieces . </s>
Except , you know , right now , Pam , I weight about 185 pounds , which is supposed to be rather high in the overweight range . </s>
So , apparently , I might drop dead right on the stage right now because according to Dr. Walter Willett , that -- to be overweight is very , very dangerous . If that doesn’t happen , I suggest that people think about the possibilities that are actually available to people in this culture . </s>
And I would especially want to emphasize that if you think that the biggest problem that poor kids have in this country right now is that they don’t get enough information about how much calories is in the junk food they eat or they don’t have enough play spaces to play outside , you’ve got a really bad conceptualization of what actually -- You’re off-topic , Paul . All right , there’s a gentleman -- the gentleman in the far corner . Thanks , if you could stand up . </s>
Hi , my name is Darrell Baxter , and my question is for the panelists for the motion , Mr. Stossell pointed out earlier that the government does get involved in certain programs such as subsidizing the corn subsidies . And also , Dr. Satcher pointed out earlier with the nutrition program , and I recall reading the article where there was an exception in the nutrition program where I think it was pizza and tomato sauce are considered vegetables . </s>
So , my question is to the extent government actually got out of the business of causing obesity through subsidies and so forth , what impact would that have on affecting dietary consumption ? David Satcher . It’s a great point and a great question . And I think that’s exactly what’s happening . I think government is beginning to change the way we spend our money relative to foods , with children especially . </s>
Look at the new nutrition act and the difference that it represents from what we’ve seen in the past in terms of the way children eat in school . So I think we are -- the government is responding to the studies that we’ve been talking about , showing how these foods are affecting lifestyles and therefore resulting in ill health , especially Type II diabetes , even in children . So , you’re right , we , the government , have been at fault in many ways in terms of what’s going on in this country , in terms of subsidies as you pointed out . And hopefully we are making the changes that we need to make . It is the role of government to continue to learn and to grow and to change . </s>
And that 's what we 're seeing now . Sir , in the -- yes . My name is Larry Parks . I host the Larry Parks show on cable access . </s>
And about a year ago I did a show , “Are they poisoning you ? ” where I addressed these issues . And the question I 'd like you to address is , how do you know if you get the government involved in this that it wo n't become politicized . In the show , I say , are you being poisoned , really attacked the food pyramid which was -- came out of government and Walter Willet who both sides have mentioned , the folks you 'd know he 's a medical doctor , heads the nutrition department at Harvard University . He wrote me that they get their people , the food industry gets their people on the committees to make the recommendations . </s>
So Dr. Satcher , you say you want healthy foods . How do you know all this wo n't be politicized ? And the recommendations , rather than being consistent with good health , or rather consistent with profits of food companies ? This is a great question . </s>
And to be honest with you , I do n't know , since everything becomes politicized . You know -- You bet . </s>
As surgeon general , what I said was that I 'm not a politician . I speak to the American people based on the best available public health science . But believe me , there were a lot of political pressures on me every time I did a report . But the fact of the matter is , the surgeon general 's report is based on the best available public health science . </s>
It has to be approved by the NIH . It has to be approved by the CDC . </s>
It has to be approved by HHS . So government is imperfect . And it 's up to us to continue to make it more perfect , a more perfect union . But it 's up to us to continue to push the government -- Paul Campos . </s>
I think it 's really important to keep in mind that scientists are people just like everybody else and that science is a deeply politicized activity because it ca n't avoid being politicized given that it 's about power and social policy and all the things that are political all the way down . I think when we look at the food industry , one thing that people ought to keep in mind is that the food industry loves the obsession that Americans have with weight . The food industry makes enormous profits from selling people food that is supposed to make them thinner , right ? </s>
The diet foods have a significantly higher profit margin than regular foods because diet foods can be sold as a kind of magical elixir that 's going to cause this weight loss if you buy something , which it does n't have something in it that it 's supposed to have in it , but which is supposedly then -- which has a substitute of something else . </s>
So for instance , a fat-free Fig Newton has more calories in it than a regular Fig Newton . Because the sugar that 's substituting for the fat in the fat-free Fig Newton is more caloric . But the fat-free Fig Newton will cost more . So the food industry loves all this stuff , loves the fact that we 're obsessing on these issues and trying to supposedly find a magic cure for our supposed obesity epidemic because that 's one of the main sources of its profit margins . And so it encourages this kind of social hysteria . </s>
Okay . Right here in the -- Well , the way to get the price down is to make more of it , right ? </s>
Is n't that what happens with -- happened with computers and everything ? So in time , we ought to be able to get the price of Fig Newtons down . Thank you . </s>
Well , blue sweater . Okay . Hi . My name is Sandy Schaefer , I 'm a plus-sized aerobics instructor . And I just wanted to make one statement that -- </s>
But very brief , okay ? Yes , very -- very brief . You get a sentence . </s>
All right . Okay . As the word `` obesity '' is ramped up , so is the bullying of fat children . So my question to you is even though you say you 're talking about fit , you still have the word `` obese , '' and you 're still targeting children and fat children specifically . </s>
And they 're now being bullied more and more , and it seems to be with government approval . So how do you speak to that ? Okay , I 'm going to pass on your question . </s>
I 'm going to let that stand as a -- as a darn good statement . Just over on the corner up there with the -- you have the white card in your hand . You still need to let the mic come to you . Thought this would be loud enough -- No , the radio wo n't pick you up . </s>
That 's the problem . In a public school where 95 percent of students receive government assistance , whether we call WIC or welfare , essentially it 's free lunch . The lunchroom has machines filled with overpriced Doritos , chocolate chip cookies , Cheetos , et cetera , which many of the students purchase , often in lieu of their available free lunch that was paid for by my tax dollars . </s>
Is there data regarding specifically the percent of urban welfare recipients how they spend their money and where they spend their money on food ? What are you getting -- what do you want to get at though ? You want to say that there is an absence of data to know whether it 's working ? I think she 's suggesting it 's not working , that they have a free lunch , but they spend $ 4 on the vending machine junk . </s>
You ca n't manipulate people as well as we think you can . Actually , there 's a -- there is a fantastic study that just came out in the journal of sociology . And it basically showed that when you have all of this at school , and you have another option , many of these kids are going to what they 're used to at home . And so what they 're not going to do is , you know , come from a home where they 're eating trash and drinking trash and back and forth , and then suddenly magically come to school and go , wow , asparagus , bring it on . </s>
They 're just not going to do this . </s>
What you 're talking about is a reward system in the brain that 's been hijacked . And you 're looking at consistent behaviors on the part of these children . This is one of the reasons why -- </s>
But Pamela , let me bring it back to our motion . So what 's the government 's role in this ? Well , the government 's role in this , you know , is a bit more complex . </s>
You 're looking at a child and controlling that child and offering options there . But you have n't talked to the parents . What we need to do now is bring in the family . If you do n't have the family as a unit in this , then this is going nowhere fast . And the government -- </s>
Am I not looking at a child to receive tax -- whose family receives tax funds -- sorry , tax- generated funds and brought their money to school and spent it on a machine instead of on their healthy lunch ? And by the way , 25 out of 28 students in my class , which is 95 percent free lunch , have cable TV . I do n't have a TV . Paul Campos . </s>
Yeah , but what you 're talking about is -- they may have the money . They have n't made the connection . Look -- </s>
Paul Campos . Again , this has been studied . There have been intense government intervention such as , for instance , the pathway study was based on the notion we 're going to educate the kids , we 're going to educate the parents about healthy eating habits and better physical activity . We 're going to do all these wonderful things that the government is advocating that we do . And what those things did was that they produced some improvement in terms of lifestyle modification , but they did not produce weight loss . </s>
There is no evidence that telling parents of children , of fatter children , that this kind of food is -- has more calories in it , and this has less and this is more nutrient rich , and that is less or whatever , is going to produce thinner children . </s>
And I want to get back to Sandy Schaefer 's point because I think it is an absolutely crucial one . </s>
Right now , what we are creating is a machine essentially for stigmatization and bullying , right , because the government is just broadcasting this message 24/7 , that if you 're a fat kid , you have something wrong with you , and you have something wrong with you that happens to be your fault because you could modify it . Paul , that 's not just the government . </s>
No , no , no , no . We 're talking about the media . Bring it on through the media . </s>
You look at those magazines . You look as those shows . You look at the fantasy world everyone lives in . </s>
That was going on a hell of a lot longer before any government intervention showed up . Right . But now you 're exacerbating it . </s>
I 'm going to -- I have time . I have time for one more question . I thought Sandy did it really when she said it the first time . </s>
In the aisle , since you came all the way down , sir . </s>
Can you step forward just a little bit ? Thanks . A little bit more . </s>
That 's great . Thank you . My name is Sakon Sharob . If we take a step back from the debate and look at the economics of it , maybe the government side could tell us why , out of all actors , government itself is the best actor to step in and solve this problem , if there 's a problem in the first place ? </s>
Dr. -- </s>
Okay . Let 's take that question quickly . </s>
David Satcher . </s>
Why the government ? I think the government is the only actor . </s>
Remember who the government is . Public health is the collective efforts of a society to create the conditions in which people can be healthy . </s>
Government calls upon all of us to work together to solve the problem . It does it through public-private partnerships . So it 's not either/or . We 're not saying the government does this , and nobody else . We need all hands in . </s>
But if the government does not do its job , it will not get done because government has the resources , and nobody else does , to monitor the health of the population . </s>
Government has the resources to make policies so that we can have an idea what people are eating and what they are exposed to in terms of information . </s>
Very quickly . So I think the government has a role that only the government can play . But it does n't mean nobody else does . Very quickly , Paul Campos . Yeah , I 'd like to point out something . </s>
The health of the American population is better now than it 's ever been before . I mean , all this talk of like a huge health crisis overlooks the fact that in fact not only is the life expectancy the highest it 's ever been and continuing to increase at a steady rate , but all -- the rates of almost all the major diseases are significantly lower than they 've been before . Life expectancy may be up . Health span is down . </s>
The quality of life is decreasing significantly . Yeah , because people who are 90 are not very healthy . We 're keeping people alive who are grossly disabled by these diseases . </s>
All right . </s>
All right , ladies and gentlemen , that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . And here 's -- we are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater , in turn . </s>
Their closing statements will be two minutes each . And remember we had you vote before the debate . Immediately after these closing statements , which are their last chance to win this thing , we are going to ask you to vote again , and the team whose numbers have moved the most will be declared our winner . So on to round three , closing statements by each debater in turn , our motion is this , `` Obesity is the government 's business . '' And here to speak against the motion , John Stossel , Emmy Award winning host of the weekly Fox Business Network Show , `` Stossel . '' </s>
So you talked about Medicare , and it 's true , it 's eaten us alive . That 's what 's going to make us go broke fastest . So you 're saying that because we have socialized medicine , which everybody loves , we have to give up our freedom and invite government to come in and control more of our lives ? I do n't think it 's any coincidence that this biggest push for more food regulation comes at a time when Congress is obsessing about paying for everybody 's health care . When government pays , it 's drawn into your personal life , and this is not a good thing . </s>
It 's not true that only government can do these things . Free people can control their own lives . </s>
Government will propose to control you because you eat too much . Will they next try to ban skydiving and extramarital sex ? </s>
How about another try at prohibition ? That might save money . You’re going to have the government teach poor people to serve asparagus when we have a $ 3.8 trillion spending already ? and transportation alternatives ? I 'll give you money . </s>
But you want government to build more bike paths ? My local councilwoman is giving out free bike helmets to encourage bicycle use . You know , my neighborhood is where Jerry Seinfeld and Sting live . </s>
I say to her , `` Why would you spend public money ? '' `` This is n't public money . It 's free . It 's a government grant . '' </s>
It 's not free . Some people say , `` Well , it 's just information . '' </s>
And information 's good , but it 's not free . These calorie counts which have n't worked , they raise the price of food a little because it costs restaurants money to post that . And they also -- all this information distracts you from other information that might be more important . This happens all the time when government intervenes . You ever look at a birth control pill label ? </s>
I happen to have one here . </s>
Look at this thing . Tiny fine print , both sides , the result is nobody reads it . </s>
It does n't make us safer . </s>
This is what government gives us . John Stossel , your time is up . </s>
Thank you very much . Our motion is `` Obesity is the government 's business , '' and here to summarize his position in support of this motion , David Satcher , the 16th surgeon general of the United States and director of the Satcher Health Leadership Institute . </s>
Well , let me say that I have seen government at its worst and I 've seen government at its best . I know government is not perfect . </s>
I grew up in Alabama at a time of segregation and discrimination . </s>
I was a teenager when George Wallace , running for governor , came to town and said that he would deputize every white man in Alabama before he would see one black child go to the University of Alabama . </s>
I 've seen government at its worst . But I 've also seen government at its best . </s>
I 've seen government protect children from lead . As a medical student I saw babies coming into emergency room with toxicity from lead . Many of them died . </s>
That was in the '60s . In 1978 , the government regulated the lead content of house paint , and we 've seen a dramatic decline in lead poisoning in children . I 've seen government at its best . I 've been involved in the eradication of polio , and all over the world , and recently learned that last year for the first time not one child in India suffered from polio . And only three countries in the world have polio , a total of less than 700 cases in the world . </s>
Government at its best is `` We , the people . '' Government is the collective efforts of a society to create the conditions in which people can be healthy . So that 's what we see as government . </s>
We believe that there is no substitute for individual responsibility . Let 's make that clear . </s>
It 's why I wrote the prescription . But individual responsibility can only take place in an environment where there is equal opportunity , there is equal access to the opportunity for a healthy lifestyle . It 's our contention that obesity is the business of the government because it is the business of the government to create those conditions . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , David Satcher . Our motion is `` Obesity is the government’s business.” And now , here to summarize his position against this motion , Paul Campos , who is author of “The Obesity Myth” and professor at the University of Colorado Law School . </s>
Thank you . I was watching the Super Bowl with my father who’s a retired physician and oncologist actually . </s>
And we were getting bombarded , of course , with erectile dysfunction ad drug advertisements . </s>
And they -- all of them have this tag line that’s legally required , right . “Ask your doctor if Cialis is right for you , ” right . So after about , you know , six of these , my father turns to me and says , “How the hell do I know if Cialis is right for you ? ” Okay , and the point was , you know , significant in two ways . One , first of all , he’s an oncologist . He doesn’t know anything about the pharmacology of erectile dysfunction drugs , right , just because he’s a doctor , right . </s>
But the more profound point is that you would think that the question of whether Cialis is right for me is a little bit more socially complex and it could be answered by a doctor , right . </s>
You’d think there would be at least one other person who would have an opinion on that question besides a doctor , right . The point of that story really is that what is now called erectile dysfunction used to be called being 50 years old , right . In other words , we take a completely natural process and we pathologize it . We turn it into a disease so that it could be treated through pharmacological intervention . </s>
And what’s really going on here , and I know that our opponents are not in any way intending this , but intention , you know , we know the road to hell is paved with , right . What’s happening is that all this talk about lifestyle intervention is something that the pharmaceutical industry loves because they know that that stuff doesn’t work . And the point of all this discourse is to soften up the regulatory pipeline for the next generation of diet drugs . That’s where the real money is , and that’s why we’re hearing about obesity , obesity , obesity all the time . Oh , we’ll get kids to eat fruits and vegetables . </s>
Alice Waters will make asparagus for everybody , and we’ll make lots of bicycle paths , and then kids won’t be fat . But they will be anyways . Until then , what will we need ? Drugs . </s>
And that’s what I would suggest this is really at the bottom line all about . </s>
Thank you , Paul Campos . This is our motion , `` Obesity is the government’s business.” </s>
And speaking last in support of the motion , Dr. Pamela Peeke . She is WebMD’s chief lifestyle expert and also assistant clinical professor of medicine at the University of Maryland . </s>
As the Discovery health correspondent , I was filming my show in South Central L.A. at the National Body Challenge where we take families and we try to teach them everything we can as physicians about being healthier . It’s not just about dropping weight but being healthier . This was a small little house . </s>
It was 97 degrees in the middle of summer . There were no sidewalks . </s>
Or what was there was scary-looking . And we were asked to go out and take a little walk . And I looked near the front door , and there was a golf club sitting there . Now , the closest golf course was probably about 100 miles away . So I asked what was that sitting there for . </s>
And the mother looked at me and she said , “That’s to beat away the dogs , the feral dogs that are running all over the place from the drug lords who are either jailed , dead or MIA and just so we can get to our car.” And I said , “You have a dog yourself . Where do you walk it ? ” “We have to drive three-four miles away to a small park , and that’s what we do.” </s>
So I went out , and I took a walk with them because my producers told me to . </s>
And we went outside , and I took the fastest walk of my life . And as we were coming around and we were being filmed , of course , the producers were in a car and I was on the sidewalk or whatever was out there , I noticed the dogs coming . </s>
They were about three blocks away , totally freaked me out . And I realized , wow , let’s break into a run . </s>
You’re walking so well . Let’s run . And so we did , and I ran for my life . I suddenly realized as we sat in there , as they ran into the house , and the kids were crying by this time because they were scared , they said , “Where’s the cookies ? ” </s>
It feels good . And the grandmother looking at me , saying , “No , we just learned something different . </s>
Let’s just pray.” And I looked around and I said , wow , obesity is the government’s business because it’s not really obesity , really , at the end of the day . Wow , health , the fitness to be able to live and survive -- that’s really what it’s about . Thank you , Pamela Peeke . And that concludes our closing statements . </s>
And now it’s time to learn which side has argues best . And now it’s time to learn which side has argued best . </s>
We’re asking you again to go to those keypads at your seat to register your vote . Again , our motion is this : “Obesity is the government’s business.” If you agree with the motion , this side’s arguments , press number one . </s>
If you disagree , this side 's arguments , push number two . If you remain or became undecided , push number three . And we 'll have the results of that vote in about one minute and 45 seconds . And so while we 're waiting for that , I just wanted to say a couple of things . </s>
One , I wanted to thank these panelists for the level of integrity and intelligence and honesty they brought to this thing . And also , you in our audience for the questions that you brought up and for your boisterousness and liveliness , and it was clear you were there with all of us , so thank you to all of you for your participation . A couple of things about our organization , Intelligence Squared . </s>
We are delighted that this was a sellout . We 've been delighted since Bob Rosenkranz set this thing up to see it grow and grow . This is our 58th debate tonight . </s>
The audiences just keep getting bigger . We appreciate that you 're here and that you made it down . Please tell your friends we 're going to keep going and keep getting bigger and better . And to that end in fact , last week -- we do a podcast based out of this . And last week , Forbes magazine published a list of the top five podcasts that will change the way you think . </s>
And we were number two on that list . </s>
And we 're delighted . And you know , it 's a scary thing to change the way you think . </s>
But you 've experienced it . </s>
It 's not so frightening . And our next debate is on March 13th . Our motion is this : China does capitalism better than America . </s>
And supporting the motion , speaking in support of the motion , Orville Schell who is director of the Asia Society Center on U.S.-China relations . And his partner will be Peter Schiff who is an investment advisor and a former economic advisor to Ron Paul . Speaking against , Minxin Pei , who is a professor of government at Claremont McKenna . And his partner is Ian Bremmer , founder of the Eurasia Group , a global risk consultancy . </s>
So we 'll have the results in just a moment . I just want to say that , for me , in this debate as a person with a very slight tendency to overweight , I -- which to me was the elephant in the room tonight . I -- I had an interesting experience today . </s>
I 've been reaching -- I did a great deal of research for this debate as I usually do . I had a sheaf of stuff I 've been carrying around with me . And I 'm a New Yorker , but I now live in Washington . So I flew up today , and I checked into one of those hotels where when you check in , they give you a cookie . </s>
Like a great big , giant chocolate chip cookie . And I looked at the cookie , and I looked down at my sheaf , and I have decided that I 'm going to carry a sheaf with me everywhere I go from now on because I was able to say no to it . So to all of those who wrote stuff that got into that research , I appreciate it . </s>
So we 'll have the results -- oh , they 're coming out now . So what I 'm going to do is read the two sets of numbers and declare our winner . Remember , the side that has changed its numbers the most in the course of this evening will be declared our winner . </s>
Our motion is this : `` Obesity is the government 's business , '' and here are the results . Before the debate , 55 percent supported the motion . 19 percent were against , and 26 percent were undecided . After the debate , 55 percent remain in support of the motion . That has not changed at all . </s>
35 percent are against . That is up 16 percent . 10 percent are undecided . The side against the motion , `` Obesity is the Government 's Business '' carries the debate . </s>
Our congratulations to them . </s>
And thank you from me , John Donvan of Intelligence Squared U.S. We will see you next time . Welcome everyone to another debate from Intelligence Squared US , I’m John Donvan of ABC News , and once again I have the pleasure and the honor of serving as moderator for the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . Six debaters , three against three , will be debating this motion , “Organic food is marketing hype.” </s>
Now , this is a debate . </s>
This is not a panel discussion or a seminar . It’s a contest . One team will win and the other will lose , and you in our live audience , several hundred of you , will be acting as our judges . By the time the debate has ended , you will have voted twice , once before and once again after you have heard their arguments to tell us where you stand on this issue . </s>
The team that has changed the most minds over the course of the debate will be declared our winner . So let’s now go to our preliminary vote . If you go to the keypads on the right arm of your chair , there a bunch of numbers but you only need to pay attention to 1 , 2 and 3 . Our motion again is , “Organic food is marketing hype.” If you agree with the motion , please press number 1 , if you disagree , press number 2 , and if you are undecided at this point , please press number 3 . And if you feel that you have made an error , just correct it and the system will lock in the last vote that you recorded . </s>
So what we’re going to do is tabulate those votes and after opening remarks I will share with you where the preliminary votes stands at that point . And so on to the debate . Round one : opening statements by each of the debaters in turn , seven minutes each . </s>
And we begin -- first I’d like to introduce Lord John Krebs , known just to us as John Krebs on this side of the pond , here in the colonies . </s>
John Krebs -- you can make your way to your lectern . John Krebs was chairman of Britain’s Food Standards Agency , which is like our Food and Drug Administration , the FDA , except it was just the F , not the D. And John , you were not chairman in 2009 . You had left the board , but it made a very -- it sent a thunderbolt to the system when it came up with a study of a comparison -- nutritional comparison between conventional and organic food and concluded what ? </s>
That there was no difference in the health benefits . Which rolled like thunder through the movement . Ladies and gentlemen , John Krebs . Thank you very much , John , for those words of introduction . </s>
And I should emphasize to all of you , do feel free to applaud at any time during my seven minutes . </s>
I start off with a disadvantage because , as Bernard Shaw said -- George Bernard Shaw -- we are two nations divided by a common language . So I hope that you will understand what I am saying even though I am speaking the English that occurs on the other side of the pond . Let me explain first of all where I’m coming from in this . </s>
As the former head of the Food Standards Agency , I am not anti organic , absolutely not anti organic . But what I am is pro accurate consumer information , I am pro healthy eating , and I am pro scientific dispassionate analysis of the facts . </s>
I’ve got no vested interest . It makes no difference to me whether or not you eat organic food , but I do sometimes get angry about the marketing hype . </s>
And let me give you a for instance . Just last week I was watching a television show about diet and health , and on the show there was a woman who was working for a low income , and she had three children , and she said to the interviewer , “I feel really guilty because I can not afford the organic food to feed my children a healthy diet.” And that made me really cross , because she didn’t need to buy organic food to feed her children a healthy diet , although -- according to the surveys -- six in ten Americans who buy organic food believe they’re getting a healthier option . </s>
And they are paying for it , because when you go shopping , if you buy organic food , you spend $ 1.60 for every dollar you would have to spend buying exactly the equivalent food produced conventionally . So , is it worth paying the extra for health benefits ? </s>
The answer is a plain , straightforward , simple “no” . Why do I say that ? </s>
I say that because I’ve scrutinized the evidence . Now if you look at the evidence , you have to ask yourselves two questions : who is saying it , and why are they saying it ? And of course , if you listen to the organic sector that has a vested interest , they will pick and choose the evidence that supports their case , and no doubt we’ll hear that later on this evening . But I prefer to believe those groups of people who are independent , impartial , objective groups of scientists put together by official agencies to study the evidence with no side one way or the other . And it’s not just the U.K. Standards Agency that John referred , but at the last count , in eight different countries where the federal or national agencies have looked at this issue , in every case they have come to the same conclusion : there is no health benefit of eating organic food when compared with conventional food . </s>
Furthermore , and this is a really important point , in the U.K. we have an advertizing standards watchdog , and a few years ago they penalized our two major supermarket chains for advertizing and claiming that organic food is healthier , and they were stopped . Those supermarket chains were stopped from making that claim . And note this : they did not come back with a legal challenge . Why did they not come back with a legal challenge ? </s>
Because there was no case to defend . </s>
There was no evident to support their case that would stand up in a court of law . So what are the supposed benefits , health benefits of organic food ? </s>
Some people think that it’s more nutritious , that it may contain more of those essential micronutrients , vitamins , or antioxidants that are supposed to protect us against cancer . But when you look at all the evidence together , sometimes organic food does contain more , sometimes it contains less , but taking the picture in the round , there is no -- absolutely no -- consistent difference . What about safety of food ? Because some people say , “Well maybe I ought not to take the risk . Organic food is more natural . </s>
It’s safer.” </s>
And indeed in Britain 70 percent of the baby food sold is organic because parents are worried about what they’re feeding their children . Well what are these safety issues ? One thing that people are concerned about is pesticide residues . Maybe the vegetables or the fruit that’s been sprayed in a conventional farm leave tiny residues on the surface that you may eat when you consume those vegetables . </s>
Well two things to note . First of all , organic farmers also use pesticides . </s>
They just use a different set of pesticides . But secondly , and more important , those residues are they -- when they are present -- in such minute quantities that they are harmless relative to the natural dangerous chemicals that occur in all the food you eat . How many of you have ever drunk a cup of coffee ? Raise your hands . </s>
Okay . Quite a few of you have drunk a cup of coffee . Well let me tell you , in that one cup of coffee there are more carcinogens that you would get in all the pesticide residues in eating conventionally produced or organically produced fruit and vegetables for a whole year . </s>
So if you’re worried about potential carcinogens in your food , don’t drink that cup of coffee . But of course , you don’t need to worry , because these chemicals may have the potential to be dangerous , but they are in such a low level in the food that you don’t need to worry about it . But in a way , this is missing the point , because you can argue hither and thither about how much of this chemical is in the food , how much of that pesticide residue is present , how much of this vitamin , and so on . </s>
What really counts is looking at the health outcomes . So , are people who eat organic food healthier than people who don’t ? And that’s a pretty difficult question to answer , but there is one study that’s looked at it , and it’s an extremely large study . It’s called the Million Women Study . </s>
It’s being carried out in the U.K. , and it’s called the Million Women Study , because it involves at least one million women who over a long time period record everything about their lifestyle , including what they eat , and subject themselves to a variety of health measures , including suffering from diseases . And that study shows that there is no difference in the health outcomes for women that eat organic food and women that don’t eat organic food . </s>
It doesn’t really matter to me whether you eat organic food or not . It’s your lifestyle choice . </s>
It doesn’t bring you any benefit . But what does matter to me is when poor people , like that woman I saw on television , feel guilty because they’re not feeding their kids organic food . </s>
Just because of the marketing hype , they feel guilty , and that , to me , is an outrage . So , I urge you to vote for the motion at the end of this evening . Thank you , John Krebs . </s>
Our motion is “Organic food is marketing hype.” And now to open arguments against this motion , I’d like to introduce Urvashi Rangan , who is director of technical policy for the Consumer’s Union . That is the organization that puts out “Consumer Reports.” And , Urvashi , your specialty there is labeling , and in particular when it comes to organic , you tell the rest of us whether if it’s organic on the label if it’s really organic in the jar . </s>
That’s right . It’s been part of my job for 10 years there , educating consumers about what organic means and what it doesn’t , and allow them to make informed choices about the foods they buy . Ladies and gentlemen , Urvashi Rangan . </s>
Thank you . Good evening everyone . I’d like to address a few things that John brought up in this resolution , and the first thing is the resolution is not about whether organic is healthier or not . </s>
That’s not what we’re debating today . We’re also not debating whether it’s more nutritious . </s>
What we’re debating is whether it’s marketing hype or not , and that is what we’re trying to judge by the end of this debate . John brought up a few things that I’m going to address , including pesticide residues and sort of dismissing any level of harm whatsoever . </s>
And if you’re eating carcinogens in one thing , why not eat it in everything ? That is simply a dangerous -- dangerous theory . </s>
And as a toxicologist for “Consumer Reports , ” I have to say that we barely understand what one chemical does at one point in time . We have no idea what the multiple exposures to low-level pesticides -- </s>
-- chemicals , drugs , heavy metals does to anybody , and so , as a mother of two , and as many people are , if you have the health of somebody else’s hands in your hands and you’re responsible for them , you want to take extra measures to figure out what you’re putting in their bodies , too . </s>
I’ll leave that now and I’m going to launch into our side of the case , which is that “Consumer Reports” has been deciphering labels since 1936 . Our sole mission is to educate consumers about marketing hype , what it is , what it isn’t . </s>
And for many years , I have to say in my last 10 years rating labels we’ve come across a lot of labels that are marketing hype . Natural : very few standards , no verification . Hypoallergenic : also marketing hype , no standards . Fragrance-free , free range . </s>
All of those labels are marketing hype . </s>
They have no standards . </s>
They have no verification . Those are our two most important criteria when we’re rating labels , and those don’t meet any of them . On the other hand , organic food meets those criteria . It does have a comprehensive set of standards behind them , and it is verified . We don’t consider that to be marketing hype , and therefore we think you should vote against this resolution . </s>
So , let me give you some more examples of marketing hype . Wonder Bread , wonder brains . They had that out for a while . FTC took action against that , that they can’t call it that . Maybe some of you recall the Smart Choices label program , a big green check mark that was industry sponsored , ConAgra , Pepsi . </s>
You found it all over , including Fruit Loops , full fat mayonnaise , a couple other things . That’s also marketing hype . Not such a smart choice . And one other one : the United Egg Producers used to have a claim called Animal Care Certified . Sounds really lovely like the animals were cared for , but it could have been used on eggs that came from chickens stuffed in the battery cages where they couldn’t stand up , put into towers of battery cages where all their poop and excrement basically rained down through the cages onto the floor , contaminating the ground , moving into the ground water : could be labeled Animal Care Certified . </s>
They stopped doing that , but , again , that’s another example of what’s marketing hype . </s>
Incidentally , organic production doesn’t allow chickens to be stuffed in those battery cages , and it’s just one of the reasons why organic offers a benefit over conventional . Let me jump into five other big reasons why organic does carry more value , and first of all just to set the stage , Congress passed an act in 1990 , the Organic Food Production Act . The USDA runs the National Organic Program . We have certifiers and inspectors accredited by the USDA . </s>
This is a public program . </s>
Everybody can participate in it . And , it is subject to accountability , it is subject to inspection itself . This is a credible labeling program . I don’t think we’re really wasting this much energy over something that is just simply marketing hype . </s>
But let’s get into five big reasons why organic offers benefit over conventional production . First of all , organic animals eat a diet free of poop . Can you believe that ? Why am I saying that ? Am I a nutball ? </s>
But no , conventional agriculture and conventional farming in this country actually picks up chicken litter from the bottom of the chicken coop , filled with poop , excrement , whatever that chicken ate -- including mammalian byproducts , cow brain , blood meal -- and guess what ? Animals eat that in conventional production . </s>
It also can include garbage , plastic roughage pellets , and this is the stuff that we freely -- in face , we call it a rich protein supplement . </s>
I mean , this is a protein considered useful for animal feeding . It’s not allowed in organic production . It’s just one reason why organic offers a benefit . Second , organic is free of antibiotics ; they can not be used . Antibiotic resistance is a huge growing public health problem in this country . </s>
We feed antibiotics to animals every single day . </s>
We wouldn’t do that with humans . </s>
We wouldn’t feed humans antibiotics every day . Why do we do it in conventional agriculture ? Number two reason why organic offers a benefit . Third , we feed animals -- chicken broilers in this country -- things like arsenic , if you can believe it . </s>
These are toxic heavy metals that we actually feed the animals . They act a lot like antibiotics . They help them grow better , they help prevent disease . And yet , the arsenic goes from their poop into the ground , it seeps into the ground , and the problem with conventional ag is people don’t think it moves anywhere . </s>
But it does . It moves into the ground , into the groundwater . </s>
We create big pits of manure that go up into the air and contaminate it . </s>
These things are controlled for in organic production . Two last things . Organic doesn’t allow the use of most synthetic pesticides . </s>
It’s true , as John points out , that some pesticides are allowed , but one report estimates that about 60 percent of the pesticides that are out there are classified as a known , probably , or possible carcinogen . If you can have food that doesn’t have those things , why wouldn’t you want to eat healthier ? </s>
Why wouldn’t that offer a benefit ? But remember , this isn’t a debate about whether you would buy it , but rather whether it is truly a measurable difference and whether it offers a credible alternative to consumers who are buying it , and whether or not consumers who buy organic are currently being deceived in the marketplace . We would say no , and therefore we urge you to vote against the resolution . </s>
Finally , I’d like to talk about synthetic fertilizers . We actually compost human waste in this country and we put it onto conventional crops . That’s right . What you put in your toilet can get composted and get put onto the food that we eat , and that’s how it gets fertilized . </s>
That is a prohibited method in organic production . You may not use human sludge as compost . It comes with a number of problems , including heavy metals . </s>
And finally , synthetic fertilizers rape the soil . And organic promotes it , and Chuck will be talking a little bit more about that . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Our motion is “Organic food is marketing hype , ” and now to speak for the motion , the only actual farmer in the debate tonight . </s>
I’d like to introduce Blake Hurst , who is a farmer in Missouri . He raises corn and soybeans and flowers along with his family . </s>
He’s done it all of his life . He’s also a writer who is published in the “Wall Street Journal” and the “Weekly Standard” and other magazines . I’m interested Blake , is it harder to farm or harder to write ? I can’t make any money at either one . Ladies and gentlemen , Blake Hurst . </s>
I’m used to not making much money . Only tonight did I learn that I was a rapist . </s>
This will come as a surprise to my family and friends , who don’t think much of me , but think more than that . </s>
If you’ve ever driven through the Midwest on a summer evening , your windshield becomes covered by bazillions of sticky glutinous gobs of insect guts . </s>
Your windshield wiper can cause a wreck because it just smears the stuff around , making your windshield as opaque as the directions for assembling a Christmas present . The bugs are corn borer moths . </s>
Corn borers cause corn to drop ears , corn stalks to fall over . They also damage the husk of the corn , making it vulnerable to a soil-borne pathogen called aflatoxin , which causes liver cancer in humans . </s>
The insecticide Bt produced by corn grown from genetically modified seed causes corn borers to swell like a balloon and to explode . I find this very satisfying . I imagine pops , like a string of firecrackers , like popcorn on a hot stove , as all across my fields corn borers explode . </s>
Bt corn of course disqualifies my crop as organic , even though a nearly identical pesticide is available to organic farmers . And aflatoxin I should point out is completely natural . Of course , we’ve on our farm lost our chance to be organic some 50 years ago . We have a picture -- we have a picture of my grandfather standing in front of a corn crib . He’s wearing a faded blue work shirt , overalls turned white from repeated washings , a broad-rim straw hat , and he’s carrying two ears of corn , one the before year and one the after , then after had a nitrogen applied to it , artificial raping nitrogen . </s>
The after year was much bigger . Grandpa is grinning widely because he’s celebrating a record yield . I should probably point out that our farm has manure as a fertilizer source and at the time planted lots of legumes in long rotations : all practices recommended by the advocates of organic farming , usually writing in a sort of a tone of breathless discovery . Yes , Virginia , people were thinking about soil fertility long before the “Oprah” show covered “Food , Inc.” When commercial fertilizer became available , yields went up , costs went down , including environmental costs , as we use less resources to produce the same amount of food . </s>
When this happens in other industries , it’s generally seen as a good thing . </s>
The father of the organic method was Sir Albert Howard , a British agriculture scientist . He taught that disease , whether plant , animal , or human , is caused by unhealthy soil , and the secret to good health is farming organically . According to Howard , “The war in the soil is the result of a conflict between the birthright of humanity , fresh food from fertile soil , and the profits of a section of big business.” That sentence could have been written a week ago and would have been just as unrealistic now as it was in 1949 when Howard wrote it . You’ll notice then , as now , the farmer is strangely absent from this narrative . </s>
Tools of big corporations bought off by seed corn caps and glossy advertisements , we’re only practicing industrial agriculture because we’re tools of the man . The truth is better captured by that picture of my grandfather smiling from year to year as he celebrates a record yield . You may find this bloodthirsty battle using chemical warfare , genetic manipulation distasteful . </s>
It’s clear that our opponents here tonight do so . They imagine farming as a holistic walk with nature as we reap her bounty with hardly a mark left on the landscape and a utopia as we discover that connection to soil has been lost because of the application of science to food . </s>
According to them we can walk back our dependence on petroleum , lose our addiction to chemicals and laboratories and be one again with nature . Rarely has so much nonsense received so much attention from so many outstanding minds . Organic production requires its own set of environmental trade-offs . </s>
Organic food takes more land than conventional farming for the same amount of food . Organic farming leads directly to more , not less , soil erosion because conventional farmers disturb the soil less . Organic rules are arbitrary with some practices clearly forbidden because of political pressure instead of science . Some of the most environmentally costly practices conventional farmers use are approved for the organic farmer as well . </s>
Some of the practices most important for food safety are not available to organic producers . Hunger is the darkest factor of all and always closer than we expect , particularly in the parts of the world that are most likely to farm organically , although they don’t call it that . Nature doesn’t care whether we’re hungry or well-fed . We wrest what we can from her reluctant arms each year , and in order to have an adequate supply of food , we have to use all the tools available to us . </s>
That’s the truth . That’s the truth of this multi-front war we call farming , and as inconvenient as it may be to the critics of the present food system , that’s the way it will always be . Eating organically is trendy , edgy , and advocated by all the right people . </s>
Organics consumers shop as a form of conspicuous self-congratulation , a chance to pat themselves on the back for their social conscience , and to enjoy the superiority over the coupon-clipping bourgeoisie shopping at Wal-Mart , though organic consumers should know this : her choices have costs , real costs : environmental costs and costs when it comes to world hunger . According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization , there are a billion hungry people in the world . </s>
Every time someone purchases organic food , more water and more land are used to produce that food than to produce the same amount of food on my farm . That’s the reason why you should vote in favor of the motion . Organic food is fashionable , cool , an attitude , a chance to identify yourself with beautiful actresses instead of old farmers in overalls . But mostly , organic food is marketing hype . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Blake Hurst . So here is where we are . </s>
We are halfway through our first round opening statement by each side at this U.S. Intelligence Squared debate . I’m sorry , I’m going to rephrase that because this needs to be right for the radio broadcast . I said U.S. Intelligence Squared , and I’m going to reverse that . </s>
We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I’m John Donvan as moderator . We have six debates , two teams of three , who are fighting it out over this motion : “Organic food is marketing hype.” You have heard three of the opening statements , and now on to the fourth . I would like to introduce Jeffrey Steingarten , who is a bestselling author and food critic for “Vogue” magazine . One of his more famous books is “The Man Who Ate Everything.” </s>
I apologize , Jeffrey , I have not read the book . Is it autobiographical ? I’m referring to a very famous other person . Well let me recommend the book and introduce once again . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Jeffrey Steingarten . Thank you . I started -- well I didn’t start out -- I started out as a lawyer and not as a food critic or a writer , and if this were a court I think I would ask the judge to exclude most of the previous testimony on the grounds that it was totally irrelevant to the proposition . </s>
To say that organic food is a marketing hype I guess means that all organic food is a marketing hype , that everything about organic food is a marketing hype . That doesn’t do you any good -- it doesn’t do the other side any good to show that there is an advertisement that shows healthy people by eating organic food , if they actually are . I doubt they’re eating the food on the set -- photographic set . So that’s marketing hype as well . I remember when I was on the FDA-approved advisory committee right at the beginning , and we were given advisory powers , and one of the things that we were given was BST , bovine somatotropin , to increase cows’ milk production . </s>
And everything we were fed , except from one -- well you know , from the Center for Science in the Public Interest , was total hype . Monsanto hired the farmers who sat in their offices , working with their computers . </s>
Monsanto put overalls on them and everything , and they talked about how they knew that their cows were happy , producing all this extra milk . We know that cows overproducing get mastitis and then there is pus , if I can use the word pus , in the milk . </s>
No one wanted to use the word pus . </s>
And maybe pus is not bad for you , but I thought it was -- The FDA was so afraid that we were going to vote against it , so they combined two committees , also the Animal Husbandry Committee , all of whom were supported by the agriculture department or by industry , for example , Monsanto . So that was lopsided and have always been lopsided , so much so that the other side was emboldened to move that it should be a crime for a milk producer to announce that there was no bovine somatotropin hormone in his milk because that would be marketing hype since there’s no difference . The forces against good food are very powerful in this country and it’s enough to make you paranoid . With all possible respect , our last speaker -- okay , I’m not going to say that you sounded like Dick Cheney , okay ? </s>
But -- -- but he talked about farming as a multi-front war and that you have to wrest from nature that , you know , these kind of little rewards you , these little , you know , corn cobs . I know four or five farmers , and I’ve spoken to them all in the last few days so that I would be able to learn all about farming . </s>
There’s one that I’ll nickname Farmer Al who grows some of the best peaches in the country . They’re organic and they’re in northern California . And it took a while for Al to start switching from non-organic to organic peaches . They’re better now . He was so mellow about it , about how you have to use this in order to avoid that pest . </s>
And I asked him whether he used Round-Up on his weeds . He said , “Oh no , we just manage the weeds.” Just as long as they’re not -- -- just as long as they’re not higher than about that , they won’t threaten the plants , the weeds won’t and also scattering eggs of predators to the pests and so on and so forth . </s>
Al’s peaches are more expensive . There’s no doubt that organic food is on average more expensive , so our next speaker , I believe having read some of what he’s written , are going to say , as the farmer did , that it’s almost a crime with all the people starving to devote any resources to some kind of elite food . Now , I know that the best vegetables that I’ve ever tasted were organic , and they were grown on Dan Barber’s property -- he doesn’t own the property ; Rockefeller owns the property -- but the property near his restaurant . Conventional agriculture is not feeding the world . </s>
To say that organic agriculture could never feed the world is sidestepping the fact that organic -- that conventional agriculture is not feeding the world and it’s dependent upon oil selling at $ 45 a barrel , it’s dependent upon steady climate , and it’s also dependent upon relatively available water . </s>
Jeffrey Steingarten , I’m sorry , you’re time is up . </s>
Okay . Thank you . Thank you , Jeffrey Steingarten . Our motion is “Organic food is marketing hype.” And now here to speak against the motion -- I’m sorry , I’ve skipped a page . </s>
Now here to speak for the motion , I’d like to introduce Dennis Avery , who is director of the Hudson Institute’s Center for Global Food Issues , who was for some time an agricultural economist who worked for the State Department and writes extensively on food policy . Ladies and gentlemen , Dennis Avery . To measure the depths of my sins , I’m holding up a book written by my son , Alex Avery . It’s entitled “The Truth about Organic Foods” and it traces the history of the movement from Germany in the 1920s on to our organic farming today , and the tragedy that organic farming doesn’t live up to the hype . </s>
The people who are buying it and consuming it and offering it to their families truly want to do the best possible thing , as speakers tonight have said , and I certainly don’t disagree with that . But this is not just an unfortunate failure to live up to the billing . It is now a serious international concern , because we are about to enter the biggest farming challenge the world has ever seen . We will have , by the year 2050 , between 8 and 9 billion people . </s>
I expect that instead of 1.5 billion affluent people , science , technology , and trade will give us 7 billion affluent people . And if the Chinese reach half of the pet saturation that we have in this country , that will mean another 250 million companion cats and dogs ; none of them vegetarian . We will need to double world food production again . We will need to triple the yields on the best farmland , because that not only gives the highest yields and the least erosion , it displaces the fewest wildlife species . The Great Plains had 60 million bison , 100 million antelope , 3 billion prairie dogs . </s>
That’s three species . The poor land has more , far more , species . We are farming 37 percent of the land area now . If we produce for 2050 by simply extending the borders of the fields we’ll be farming 80 percent of the land area . </s>
And if you think conventional farming isn’t feeding people now , just wait . And the organic farmers can’t do this . The key is nitrogen . The Earth had 1.5 billion people before we got nitrogen fertilizer . We would still be at 1.5 billion people were it not -- that might be better . </s>
You might think you prefer that , but you aren’t going to get there with zero population growth movements , and you aren’t going to get there with meatless Mondays . You’re going to have to triple the yields again on the best farmland . Plowing itself is a danger . Summer of ’07 , 12-inch rainfall in southeastern Minnesota , second- largest concentration of organic farmers in the country . They not only had flooding ; they had mudslides . </s>
Whole hillsides sloughed off . </s>
Sandy loam hills should not have been in anything but no- till farming . No-till cuts erosion by 65 to 95 percent . </s>
It doubles soil moisture . It’s the most sustainable farming system ever developed . And organic farmers can’t use it because you have to have herbicides to kill the cover crops so you can plant what you really want to grow . They can’t kill their cover crops . And the yields over all are about half as high . </s>
We had a famous study that came out in the summer of 2007 from the University of Michigan , which has no school of agriculture . The lead author was a fully- qualified geologist . And they said organic farming can feed the world and more . You’re entitled to believe that , but they made a fairly serious mistake in the paper . </s>
They talked about one study in which green manure crops had put 1,500 milligrams per acre of nitrogen into the soil and that 66 percent of this nitrogen had been delivered to the seedheads of the crops . That doesn’t happen . Everybody agrees that nitrogen fertilizer puts a higher percentage of its nitrogen into the crop seeds . Thirty-three percent is the accepted figure . </s>
On green manure crops it’s 20 percent . The different between 66 percent and 20 percent is starvation for half of the humans , or the destruction of wildlife habitat on a scale never yet seen in this world . This is not truth , and it is not a favor to you or to the population of the rest of the world to tell something about organic farming that is demonstrably false . We will have to turn high-yield farming into higher-yield farming . </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you , Dennis Avery . Finally , with our motion “Organic food is marketing hype , ” to summarize his position against the motion I’d like to introduce Charles Benbrook , chief scientist at the Organic Center , which makes you the only person who has the word organic on your business card . The Center produces science with the goal of aiming to persuade all of us to go organic . Ladies and gentlemen , Charles Benbrook . </s>
Thank you , John , very much . First of all , I think I need to start with an apology to my esteemed colleagues on the pro side of this debate , because I’m actually going to speak to the motion . </s>
Tonight we’re debating whether organic food is marketing hype , and the way that I understood this -- and I think probably most of the people on our side -- is that we’re talking about the companies and the farmers that grow organic food and sell it to people . They put claims on the label . There is advertizing , there’s lots of information on websites . I think we all have a pretty good idea on how companies market products and deliver information to consumers . And in the United States , as you know , there is a number of laws and regulations that govern what is marketing hype and what’s not . </s>
Urvashi spoke to some of that . </s>
We’ve all heard the saying one aspirin a day helps prevent heart attacks . </s>
That’s kind of amazing that it does , but in large clinical trials , people that take an aspirin a day have a statistically significant lower risk of heart attack , and so the FTC and the FDA have allowed that claim on -- in advertising for aspirin . </s>
But if you heard an aspirin a day prevents heart attacks , that of course would be marketing hype . To claim that it will prevent goes over the line into marketing hype . So , how do we judge whether the claims that are made or the information that’s passed on by organic food companies crosses this line into misinformation or materially misleading information , which is a standard in the FTC guidelines ? What the government says -- now , think about the last time you went to the supermarket . You can’t walk down any aisle without leading labels that say they have reduced this or low that or a good source of this or promotes heart health or promotes eye health or good for your cholesterol , heart healthy , etc . </s>
All of these claims that either promote a food product because there’s more of something that’s good or less of something that’s not good for you , like saturated fat or cholesterol or salt , embedded in those claims are at least a 25 percent difference in the level of the nutrient . </s>
This is applied fairly universally across the entire food system . So , whenever you see these labels that says it’s , you know , a good source of lycopene -- you’re buying a tomato product ; lycopene is a nutrient in tomatoes -- and it says a good source of lycopene , you can trust that the company has done testing that shows that there’s at least 25 percent more in their product compared to others . So , as we go through the evening , keep in mind that if there is solid scientific evidence that one food product , whether it’s conventional or organic , has higher or lower of a particular nutrient that’s good or bad for you buy a Good or bad for you , by a 25 % margin that the government allows a labeling claim to be associated with that . </s>
Now , how is organic food marketed ? What are the principle claims ? And benefits ? Well , number one , of course , is organic farmers may not apply toxic synthetic pesticides . It 's just a blanket prohibition . </s>
The products that they can apply encompass all of those that post any risk to humans or the environment . </s>
It 's true organic farmers request use natural products like copper fungicides , sulfur is used to help protect diseases . </s>
Natural insecticide , Bacilus thuringiensis that Blake talked about , it 's how Monsanto and other biotech companies have found a way to move the capacity to produce this natural insecticide into the corn plants . And so without a doubt the reduction in exposure and risk from pesticides is the most common claim that you read . And there is no question that organic farming reduces pesticide risk . </s>
It 's laughable for anybody to argue that it does n't . You know , American agriculture , apply rounds , a billion pounds of pesticides a year . Some are not terribly hazardous , including Glyfosate which Blake will use on some of his genetically engineered crops . But there are several other pesticides , especially insecticides to do pose significant risk . </s>
And the fact that we 're all exposed to pesticides , even before we 're born , does play a role in our public health . Do you all know that the average baby born in America has like 200 chemicals in its blood the moment it’s born from the exposures to its mother ? About one out of eight babies are born with a diagnosable birth defect ? </s>
About a quarter of the couples in America are having trouble having babies . They need some help in getting pregnant and carrying a pregnancy to term . The scientific literature is loaded with thousands of papers that demonstrate a connection between exposure to pesticides and these adverse health outcomes . To say that there are no risks for pesticides and no evidence , I mean if you do n't -- if you do n't believe in science , fine . </s>
Go ahead and make that statement . But you ca n't claim that you read the scientific literature . </s>
That -- you know , it 's just the way it is . Another of the major claims that are made , and marketed , if you 're shopping in the livestock part of the aisle , in the dairy or eggs or beef , livestock and organic farms have to be given ample space to carry out natural behaviors . They have to be raised in an environment where they can stay healthy without their daily dose of antibiotics , which Urvashi spoken out . They have to be given access to outside , unless it 's 20 below and the weather would be dangerous for them . </s>
But they have to be raised in a much more humane way . That 's built right into the rules ; all organic farmers have to do it . If you care about how animals are cared for , if you care -- it 's great that we can buy cheap bacon and eggs done cost much . If you do care how animals are cared for , organic agriculture with the only system of agriculture backed up by solid rules that require sound animal welfare : one of the reasons that we hope you 'll vote against the motion . That concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
The motion being argued is “Organic food is marketing hype.” We now have the results of where you , the several hundred of you in our live audience stood on the motion before the debate began . The motion is organic food is marketing hype . </s>
We asked you to vote , tell us whether you stand for , against , or undecided on this motion . Here are the results . Before the debate , 21 % of you are for the motion , 45 % against , and 34 % undecided . That 's where things stand at the beginning of the debate . </s>
We 'll ask you to vote once again when the debate has concluded . </s>
The team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . Now on to round two : it 's our middle round . </s>
And it 's where the debaters address each other directly and also take questions from you in the audience and from me as well , as moderator . I 'd like to begin with a question to the side that 's arguing for the motion that organic food is marketing hype . </s>
In your critique of those who support and believe in organic food and organic farming , there is just -- there are these intimations of elitism that people who like organic food are people who use words like “intimations , ” for example . </s>
That it 's just a little bit snobby and a little bit snotty . </s>
In fact , the research shows that the majority of people who buy organic food in this country are at the higher end of the educational scale . I want to ask you , are you saying that all of these well educated people are actually rather stupid ? Are they missing the point ? John Krebs . You 're absolutely right that people who purchase organic food tend to be from the wealthier sections of society simply because it 's more expensive to buy . </s>
And that 's , you know -- you folks that buy it , you can afford it . </s>
There are plenty of people out this in this country who could n't afford to do it . Does it mean that you 're stupid ? Absolutely not . </s>
But it means that to some extent , you have bought in to what I claim is marketing hype . If I can just go back to Urvashi 's opening comment , it is absolutely marketing hype that the claim that organic food is healthier for you , and that 's why the advertising regulator in the U.K. stamped down on the two major retailers that made this claim , as well as on the organic producer body , the soil association who was making the same claim . It was hype . There was no case to support it . </s>
And it was banned . If that is n't a straight forward piece of hype , exaggeration , implicit deception , I do n't know what is . Jeffrey Steingarten . I wonder how long you conducted the million -- the lady study . Was it six months or six weeks , was it two years ? </s>
Jeffrey , what 's your point ? Why are you raising that ? </s>
Many of the toxins in pesticides , herbicides could take years and years . What about that , John Krebs ? Do you think it 's too soon to know ? </s>
The million women study is still going on . It 's been going on now for about eight years . It will continue for another probably 15 or so years . So we 're looking at long term effect and no effects have shown up so far . </s>
Urvashi Rangan . </s>
I think we 're talking about elitism but it 's really that organic food costs more . </s>
Organic food costs more to produce , and there are a couple reasons for that . One is that it 's incredibly physically labor intensive . You 've got to -- as Jeffrey pointed out , you have to pull the weed . You ca n't just spray a chemical on it . It 's harder to do . </s>
So there is no question that organic food is harder to produce . But the other major factor that has not been mentioned today is the amazing subsidies that all of our taxpayer money goes to to support cheap food production to subsidize late crops on corn and soy , and the myriad of ingredients that stem from that that end up in processed foods , hence creating cheat processed foods . </s>
Organic does n't get subsidies . That 's why between that and what it does , it costs more . Blake Hurst . Beg to differ -- of course , organic qualifies . Same subsidies that I do , subsidies are tied to the ground . </s>
They do n't ask how you produce the crop . My question -- I guess I would like to ask , you talked about fertilizer raping the soil . How does the soil know the difference between -- I mean nitrogen , you look at your periodic table . </s>
There it is , it appears . When I apply nitrogen on some of our acres for manure , when I apply some nitrogen from some of our acres , commercial fertilizer , how does the soil know the difference ? Charles Benbrook . I 'll speak to nitrogen . One of the major problems around the world , back in February 23 , those of you that read the “Wall Street Journal , ” there was a remarkable story about how the subsidies in India for nitrogen fertilizer started back in the Green Revolution days have actually led to such excessive nitrogen fertilizer use in India , that what happens when you put extra nitrogen on ground , you stimulate microbial activity in the soil . </s>
And those microbes , they eat your organic matter , in effect , which degrades your soil quality . And the “Journal , ” it was a very interesting and hard hitting story . And it was just a week after in “Science Magazine , ” there was a major research report that Dennis may have seen about China and how there is this major problem in China about the acidification of soils from too much nitrogen . In America , in the Midwest , less than 35 % of the nitrogen that gets applied winds up supporting the growth of that corn plant . </s>
And the rest , some of it goes into the water and some of it volatizes into the environment . Organic farmers , on the other hand , nitrogen is expensive to them because they do n't have access to these cheap commercial sources of readily available nitrogen fertilizers . </s>
They have to get their nitrogen the old fashioned way with cover crops and legumes and compost . It 's dear to them and it’s valuable . And they use it much more carefully . They do n't need as much to support the same amount of growth . They do n't pollute the water . </s>
They do n't contribute as much to global warming . And they improve the quality of the soil and it 's these sorts of win , win , wins that are why even the USDA acknowledges that organic farming is better for the environment . </s>
And that 's one of the claims . Dennis Avery of the Hudson Institute . There is a new set of products on the market from Arcadia Biosciences . </s>
They 're actually the product of a -- a research mistake at the University of Alberta . They were trying for drought tolerant crops and instead , they got nitrogen-efficient crops . Rapeseed , rice and wheat ; you can now put on half as much organic nitrogen , get in effect what we thought of as a full crop , with very little left in the soil to leach into the nearby streams . Can we hope that the organic farmers will , at some point , recognize this benefit and help protect the water with nitrogen efficient biotech crops ? What does that have to do with how organic food is marketed in the United States ? </s>
what 's the point ? I want to ask Blake Hurst , because you 're our only farmer possibly in the room . I think there may be some farmers in the audience , but certainly on the panel . In terms of just the reality check that you can provide to us , a guy who gets his hands in the soils , what have you heard tonight that is the most out of touch with what really happens in the real world ? I get this idea that -- Jeffrey says that conventional farming is not feeding the world , so his solution is to produce less food ? </s>
I mean this idea -- it is , indeed -- Totally wrong . If you 're growing corn -- </s>
Let 's let Blake answer that question . Yeah , well give me your example . </s>
If you 're growing corn on two pieces of land , farmers told me this , two pieces of land , one conventionally and one organically , the conventional plot will produce more corn . If you have less than a modern culture , the number of calories produced on the organic piece of land , which is what we care about , the number of calories on the organic land will be greater than on the conventional land . What 's your source for that ? </s>
That 's impossible . I would like to know the source . </s>
Charles can tell you . I 'm not a scientist . </s>
Tell him Charles . Charles Benbrook . This is an important point . </s>
On Blake 's farm , we were speaking on the right over here . You 'll be getting out in the field pretty soon to plant corn , right ? In the next couple weeks that corn will germinate in 10 days . It will grow vigorously capturing solar radiation , pulling up nitrogen from the soil , and producing a crop for about 90 days . After 90 days it goes into synapsis . </s>
It has to dry so he can get his combine in , and really , from the second week in August , maybe the third week in August , that field really is n't growing anything more . Organic farming is based on a much more diverse set of crops . Organic farmers are going to get a cover crop on to the corn ground as soon its harvested so that that fall solar radiation is captured and supports biomass which support microorganisms in the soil . So the way that organic farmers can and do produce more per acre is they produce multiple crops . They integrate livestock and often fish with their crops . </s>
And they 're using that solar radiation in the early spring and the late fall when it 's not as intense in the summer . If you drive through the Midwest , our greatest agriculture regulation , it 's only producing a crop for about 90 days of the year . And there are at least six weeks in the spring and fall when it could be growing something . And something is growing on all the organic farms . </s>
That 's how -- John Krebs is also a scientist can respond to that . Another way to -- </s>
Dennis , I 'm going to led John Krebs respond . I have a simple question to Jeffrey . </s>
If indeed organic production is more efficient , produces more yield per hectare than conventional , why is organic food more than expensive ? Who is making all this extra money ? </s>
The reason it 's more expensive is because you get less per hectare . No , because it is -- first of all , there is industrial organic , the farming about which I do n't know a lot . </s>
Sorry , could you say that again ? </s>
What ? Why is it more expensive ? No . What were the two source of organic ? You said there is industrial organic and there is something else organic . </s>
A smaller scale ? </s>
There is industrial organic . When we 're talking about marketing hype are we talking about the system organic are or we taking -- Yeah , we 're talking about healthy organic . Just a minute . </s>
No evidence that it 's healthier . Yes , I know . I was just trying to get you . Did it work ? </s>
The reason it 's more expensive because it involves a lot of hand labor . You have to hire in the -- in the northeast you have to hire either migrant laborers or you have to build them houses . The best apple farmer in this whole area builds houses for her laborers , and then sends them to school , sends the kids to school . I guess the farmers are not in that position . </s>
But there is a lot of hand work . You ca n't have a combine coming through and doing whatever a combine does . Plus also , I understand that this whole tillage argument -- I have been told that organic farming does not require tilling . Is that true or do you know -- </s>
No , that is not true . It 's bare earth farming . Organic farming is bare earth farming . Dennis can you respond to Charles ' point that he made about essentially that an organic farmer is working a more diverse range of -- working the soil in more diverse ways by introducing different crops and its interaction with livestock ? It 's certainly working in more diverse ways . </s>
And I want to compliment the organic movement for having been concerned from the beginning with the health of the soil . Unfortunately , unfortunately they are n't using it very well . And the point he made about the corn getting its growth in the first 90 days means that the organic farmers are starving their corn for part of that 90 days . </s>
They are not getting what that field could produce because the organic nitrogen is slow release . Urvashi , do you want to come in on this ? It is a strange argument . </s>
And what I guess I want to -- I want to zoom out a little bit and talk about genetically modified crops . The U.N. has issued two reports actually , one just recently and one a few years ago . That for Africa and Eastern Europe , organic agriculture is the answer for those areas for maintaining the sustainable food production supply . </s>
The second thing that also has -- Why ? What is this logic of that ? </s>
Why is organic the answer for those areas ? It resides within many of the reasons we 're talking about , sustainable production , jobs , less pesticides , less inputs . </s>
Those things cost money . While our opponents are reporting the miracles of genetic modification , and pesticides , and how wonderful they are , what most consumers do n't know is that those things were not required to be tested for how well they work or how safe they are before they got out on the market . </s>
And those are the aspects that the U.N. is considering when they make those reports available and anyone is free to read those reports . Blake Hurst . Of course there is long and extensive testing for -- what the National Resource Council says -- genetically modified seed is tested before it goes on the market . How many of you have bought genetically modified seed ? How many of you have toured Montsanto 's laboratories ? </s>
How many of you know the process that it goes through ? I have . The point I 'm making is that that 's blatantly untrue . As to the point of whether it works or not , I guess that is the that 's the consumer -- because the NRC says that there is no conceptual distinction , that 's the National Research Council , your government , no conceptual distinction exists between genetically modification of plants and microorganisms by classical methods or by molecular techniques that modify DNA and transfer genes . </s>
There is no difference . </s>
It 's just a faster and more effective way of improving crops . The biggest mistake the organics standard made was not accepting genetically modified seeds . Absolutely . I 'd like to go to the audience for some questions . </s>
How this works is that if you raise your hand and I find you , I 'll ask you to stand up . If you 're a member of the news media , we 'd prefer that you tell us that fact , who you work for . You 'll be given a microphone . </s>
And hold the microphone about that far from -- one fist away from your mouth so that the radio can pick you up . I just have a question before we get there . </s>
What strikes me about this debate is that the tone here is as bitterly partisan as anything that 's happening in Washington . And I 'm curious about why that is . And it 's on both sides . It 's also from all of us here in the hall . There is a nasty feeling to this issue . </s>
And I 'm curious about why -- we 're talking about food . What we eat . </s>
I want to hear from one panelist , nominate yourself on each side , about why are we there ? In this topic ? </s>
Charles , you 're nodding . You represent the organic center . Why ? </s>
The organic food industry -- it actually deserves the word industry , now accounts for about 3 % of our food supply . It 's not threatening the profits of Cargill and ADM and Craft and General Mills in the marketplace , yet , but it is in the world of ideas . And with all due respect to John Krebs , the science is strongly lining up behind organic farming . It is more nutrient-dense . </s>
There are 70 or 80 studies that have reached that conclusion . To just dismiss them that they 're not there , you know , you can do it . But if you read science , it 's there . So I think organic food and what this whole area represents , it worries the conventional agriculturist to that people are going to start to ask questions about how our food is grown and what 's in it , and how it might be contributing to the fact that we Americans spend more than any nation in the world on healthcare , but our health across a number of measures really does n't stack up that well . And I think it 's a lot about what we eat . </s>
John Krebs , do you want to -- not just respond , but to take on my question . Well , as I said at the beginning , you would expect those with organic on their business card to play the claim that organic food is better for you . </s>
Not surprising , Chuck , well done . But why is this such a divisive issue ? It 's a divisive issue because it 's a side show from the real problems that we face which are first of all about feeding the growing world population as Dennis said . And second of all , for those of us who are lucky to live in an affluent society , to eat a healthy balanced diet and secure our own health . </s>
Organic food is a complete side show to both of those issues . </s>
Those of us who care deeply about those issues are very frustrated by the repeated claims of the organic sector explicit or implicit that they will solve these problems . So it sounds like each side thinks the other side is actually doing harm here ? Exactly . Not just disagreeing but doing harm . </s>
Gentlemen , right there you could rise and hold the mic close to you , and please make it a brief question . Thank you . </s>
One of the points that Mr. Avery made was that we need to significantly increase food production . And I 'd like to just suggest that in making fun of meatless Monday , you are asking a question about the concerns of livelihood of millions of people . 1.7 million people who died of heart disease , diabetes , stroke , and cancer last year because of easily attributed to a number of academic studies to their eating meats . My question is , would n't reducing meat production significantly reduce overall agricultural production requirements ? </s>
I 'm going to pass on the question with respect because it 's really -- I do n't think it 's on our topic of organic food and marketing hype . It 's a question about meat versus vegetables , I believe . If the question is about subsidy , we 're talking about how people are not getting access to make an even playing field for organic foods . And meat is a huge -- </s>
I think we 're off topic . But with respect , thank you . Yes , right there . </s>
Thank you . I am a member of the media . </s>
I work at Martha Stewart Living , and I worked on cookbooks . But I have a question . </s>
One of the things that has n't been addressed here at all tonight is the question of flavor . We 're talking about marketing hype . It 's hard to get away from the fact that an organic banana tastes like a banana , or an organic peach takes like a peach . And , you know , that’s less and less true of conventional produce . So what 's the question ? </s>
No , but it 's better organic , which is good . The question is where is -- you know , where is the hype if we 're really looking at flavor ? Are you actually -- your question really is , does an organic taste food better , and is n't that one of its benefits ? Yes . Right ? </s>
Okay . </s>
Fair question . I guess that 's what is the question . Fair question . Fair question . </s>
Yeah . John , believe it or not , this question actually is germane to the debate . I agree that it is . </s>
I just want the other side to answer it . I 'll come back to it , though . I have been privileged to watch a program taped by a couple of comedians who perform primarily in Las Vegas who conducted a number of blind taste tests on the street in Las Vegas . And nobody could tell the difference from nothing . I grew up on a farm . </s>
Our tomatoes , during the height of the growing -- of the harvest season , were wonderful . The rest of the year , we did n't get tomatoes except out of cans . </s>
This whole freshness thing , fresher tastes better . If your organic is fresher , it may taste better . But that 's apart from its being organic . Charles . </s>
I think -- Charles Benbrook . </s>
I think this is -- I really appreciate this question because it 's very important . The organic food industry has not claimed that organic food tastes better . And the reason that -- they know it does sometimes , but they do n't have the systems in place and the ability to guarantee a consumer that it 's always going to taste better . And it 's an example of where the industry has not gone over that line to hype its products . </s>
Now , there 're some consumers out there that are convinced that it always tastes better . </s>
And maybe to them , it does . </s>
But I actually think the organic food industry has been fairly responsible in not getting beyond the science and beyond what they can guarantee . And I think that they deserve a certain degree of respect for this . And they certainly deserve your vote to this motion because they have n't gone out of their way and made claims . Now , some people say -- you know , some consumers -- the woman that John spoke about , being guilty about not eating organic food . </s>
That 's a shame . You know , all mothers should feed their kids lots of fruits and vegetables , organic or conventional . </s>
But you ca n't hold that against the industry that 's trying to be responsible in telling people about what the true benefits are and they are significant . Okay . So we 're in the question-and-answer section of this Intelligence U.S. -- we 're in the question-and-answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News , your moderator . </s>
And we have six debaters , two teams of three , debating this motion , `` Organic food is marketing hype . '' </s>
We 're going back to the audience for questions . Gentleman in the blue shirt . </s>
Hello . </s>
This question is for Dr. Rangan . You talked about the fact that -- or you claim there was a fact that organic food could be verified , and there were standards for organic food . My understanding is that 's not true , that the standards are for organic farming and that there 's a difference between process and product and that the standards do not say anything about the products . </s>
It 's just the process by which the product is obtained . So my question for you is , if I gave you an apple , and you had to do an analysis to determine whether it was organic or not , and it was a scientific analysis , presumably a chemical or physical analysis , what exactly would you do to verify that it was an organic apple ? Yeah , your point is well taken . It is production . It 's the Organic Food Production Act . </s>
And it 's about production . And the seal is on the food , and it is about what goes into the production of that apple or that orange . </s>
And just incidentally , there 's also a whole scientific advisory board that reviews and approves materials that are allowed and printed in processed foods as well as in fresh foods . So there is a whole framework around that . </s>
And that 's what we 're here to talk about today . That is the foundation of what it is . How would you test for a food that was organic ? </s>
You might look for genetic modification . That 's prohibited . </s>
If it 's a banana , we can taste it . In fact , your point goes -- it 's very difficult to test for whether something 's organic or not . If it had prohibited residues , you might know that it was n't . But the point is -- and that 's why there is so much recordkeeping involved . </s>
There is so much work involved for a farmer to become organic because the whole paper trail of what went into that farm has to be documented . Everything that went into the particular jam that was processed has to be documented . Those things are n't required for conventional agriculture . John -- </s>
And the materials used are restricted . And -- </s>
John Krebs to respond . -- that is the framework that exists . It 's a very interesting question . When I was head of the Food Standards Agency , we started sponsoring research to develop such tests . And such tests can be developed because this is a bit of technical chemistry . </s>
The isotopes of carbon and nitrogen that come from chemical fertilizers are different from the isotopes out of manure or compost . But the organic movement strongly opposed this , and they said it was a complete waste of money to develop these tests . They never said why they thought it was a complete waste of money . But I thought I had a pretty good idea that a lot of the produce that 's on sale as organic is not actually genuinely organic . </s>
And I think it would be a good thing if the regulators did use tests like that and really showed what was on sale in the shops . Well , John , I think you should speak for the U.K. on that because there 's a lot of us that follow what goes on in the United States . The organic label has meaning in this country . </s>
Let 's go back to the audience for questions . Does the regulator carry out the tests ? No . Ma'am , can you see me looking at you ? </s>
They enforce the rules . If you could stand up , yes , and we 'll bring a microphone . And if -- it 'll be handed down to you . </s>
You do n't need to work your way up . Question , please , now . </s>
Yes , question . Thank you . My question is that for people who are interested in sustainably produced agriculture , there 's some consumer concern that the rise of industrial organic agriculture , which was touched on briefly , has sort of called into question the rigorous standards that are in place for determining whether something is organic or not . </s>
And I was hoping the panel could speak to that . How rigorous it is and if -- I know people -- I know people who have compared factory chicken production in the conventional way of doing it and in the organic way of doing it . </s>
Now , it 's still about factory chicken production . </s>
But it is , number one , the chickens do n't have to have access to the outside . They have to have been outside . If you have something that passes the organic tests , it gets the approval of a certifier , who is also certified by the Department of Agriculture , there was nothing you 're going to have to fear about the food . Raising animals in a humane way -- I go to the green market twice a week . There are people who raise animals in a conventional humane way . </s>
But most conventional agriculture does not do that . And I would say that the organic movement should receive -- that 's why you have to pay more because it -- But ma'am , are you -- And we 're getting very bad karma by eating this -- </s>
Ma'am , are you asking do we know -- are you asking do we really know how rigid the rules are and whether they 're being followed ? Yes . </s>
You 're asking -- </s>
Some of the regulations are in place in organic -- when people buy organic , they assume that -- Excuse me , can we pass her a microphone ? I 'll repeat it for her . Oh , I 'm sorry . </s>
You want to -- Sure . When people are -- Can we pass the microphone ? Yeah , sorry . </s>
My question is , when you 're buying organic , you 're assuming certain things about the production of the food . And when things are produced on farms that can be considered factory farms when they 're such large scale , can the standards be scaled up to some of the sizes of farms that we 're seeing ? Okay . I 'm going to let Blake take the question , but I do n't quite understand it , so if you could rephrase it . Well , yeah . </s>
There 's a whole lot of -- I mean , at what size does my farm get too big to be moral ? </s>
I mean , what size farm is immoral ? When do I become industrial ? Confined animal feeding operations . I think it 's useful to point out that if we 're talking about the chickens being indoors or outdoors , the reason we get flu every year is from Asia where most of the chickens and ducks are still kept outdoors and they are wandering up and down the street of the village , and it is the interaction between humans -- </s>
But that 's in Asia . -- and those animals that we get the Asian flu . We get cholera from hogs . We had -- this is historic . Most of our epidemic diseases have come about through this close interaction of people and animals , and modern confinement production is protecting you from those diseases . </s>
Okay , Urvashi , so we 're talking about -- </s>
Okay . I 'm sorry , Dennis , that is just garbage . That is not the case . </s>
So you -- I 'm sorry . Confined animal feeding operations -- I do n't know if anybody 's heard about lagoon pits of poo the size of a great lake that exists , and these are bacterial cesspools for lots of viruses . The H1N1 was a mixture of bird , pig , maybe something else . </s>
We have huge hog farms in North Carolina . We have huge problems with bacterial problems down there from the poo pits . This does n't just come from China . </s>
We 've got the problem right here with industrialized agriculture in this country . </s>
Gentleman with the beard . Hello . Could you stand up , please ? Sure , hi . Mr. Hurst , you really caught my attention when you said that organic agriculture should stop aligning itself with celebrity actresses and start talking to farmers . </s>
Michael Jackson , Ray Charles , Brittany Spears , Beyonce , Christina Aguilera -- </s>
All right , all right , I need a question . -- Mariah Carey -- my question to you is , should we really be thinking twice and flipping the question around to say , is chemical food marketing hype ? Those names I read by the way to give you some context are Pepsi spokespersons that I have seen on television in my lifetime . Thank you . And Pepsi is made from corn . </s>
Was there a question ? Yes . Well , his question was , is conventional farming marketing hype , and given that actually your team has claimed a superiority in several areas for conventional farming , I think it 's a fair question . </s>
Okay , yeah . Well , then , of course , the answer would be no . </s>
I love a pithy answer . White shirt ? Right behind you . This is our last question . </s>
The part of the marketing that I 'm interested -- Can you stand up , please ? Sure . The part of the marketing that I 'm interested in hearing about is the health oriented marketing that could be either viewed as hype from the one side or not from the other . And what I had a hard time following was the notion that on the one side that defended organic food , organic farming , there was a listing of 80 scientific papers that proved the health benefits of organically produced food . </s>
And on the other side there was a lack of trust in the scientific data . </s>
So I was hoping that we could actually talk just briefly about one , just pick one of the 80 that says there 's no doubt that there are health-related benefits to organic food , and then just ask the other side why that 's not accurate . Sure . The `` British Journal of Medicine '' published a study about two years ago that showed that children born to mothers who consume predominantly organic milk and meat during pregnancy with its elevated levels of conjugated linoleic acids , which are a heart healthy fat , had lower -- the children had lower levels of eczema . It was really the first time an actual health benefit in humans from consuming organic food has been proven and published in a peer review journal . </s>
And , of course , this is for any health problem . So many different things affect health . It 's very unusual to be able to trace a disease or -- to a single part of our lifestyle . So that 's one study that came out , and it has n't been refuted . All right . </s>
Let 's hear the other side respond . Yeah . Did you say that was the first that 's come out after 80 years ? </s>
No , no . </s>
He said it 's one that 's come out . A study proving a health benefit in humans , when I said before that there 're 80 studies , those are studies comparing the nutrient levels in organic food to conventional food . Now , there 're a lot of people that feel eating more nutrients really does n't make you any healthier , but you got to wonder why the U.S. government is spending so much time and energy trying to get us to eat more fruits and vegetables . John Krebs . </s>
Well it’s very simple . In that study as in many others , it’s very difficult to tease apart the contribution of different factors . There’s no clear proof in that study that the benefits that Chuck has alluded to were to do with eating organic foods , because there are a lot of other differences between the comparison population . So we still don’t have any evidence that organic food is healthier food for you . </s>
And that concludes round two of this debate . And here’s where we are . We are about to hear closing statements from each debater . They will be two minutes each and it’s their last chance to change your minds and from the audience vote before hand , we know where you stood for before the debate began . Here’s what we have . </s>
Our motion is “Organic food is marketing hype.” Before the debate , 21 percent of you were for this motion , 45 percent were against and 34 percent were undecided and we’ll ask you to vote again shortly and we’ll ask you in that way to pick our winner as this debate concludes just a few minute from now . But now onto round three , closing statements from each team in turn . Speaking first against the motion , organic food is marketing hype , Charles Benbrook , chief scientist at the Organic Center . Thank you , John . </s>
As I said before , this is about the claims or the positive attributes that are used in labeling and advertising , educational material on websites to convince consumers to buy more organic food . That’s what we’re talking about . The claim that is most common and most known to Americans is about the reduction , significant reduction in pesticide use and risk that’s associated with organic farming ; that’s kind of a no- brainer . Organic farmers don’t apply any of the dangerous pesticides that we have a huge program in the EPA to deal with . And they don’t use any of the pesticides that are causing all the problems with bees . </s>
They don’t use any of the herbicides that are castrating male frogs and feminizing them all throughout the Midwest . They just don’t use them at all ; it’s prohibitive . And that prohibition is embodied in the regulations . In terms of animal drugs and in particular , antibiotics and growth promoting hormones , hormones that push animals to produce more quickly , organic farmers can’t use them . It’s against the rules and that’s again , embodied in the standards . </s>
So when a company promotes organic food as better for animals , this is one of the reasons . The other claim that is ubiquitous is that organic farming is better for the environment . The U.S. Department of Agriculture has agreed with us . </s>
Organic farmers build soil ; they add humus to the soil ; they reduce greenhouse gasses ; they reduce the loss of nitrogen into the groundwater . </s>
They promote bio-diversity ; they don’t kill bees ; they don’t kill frogs ; they don’t kill beneficial insects . </s>
And again this suite of benefits are embodied in binding , enforceable regulations that a part of the rules . So please don’t buy into the arguments of the other side that because organic farming can’t feed the world and all these other claims , that you should vote for this motion . </s>
Thank you , Charles Benbrook . </s>
Our motion is organic food is marketing hype and summarizing his position for the motion , John Krebs , principal of Jesus College , Oxford and former chairman of the U.K.’s Food Standards Agency . I just want to make two points very briefly . </s>
First of all , we haven’t really discussed what is organic food ? When I was head of the Food Standards Agency , I asked to meet with the organic food sector . </s>
Ten people turned up and I said okay , I just want to talk to one of you . It turned out there were 10 different certification bodies for organic food in the U.K. and they all disagree with one another . No one body would allow the others to represent their view because they didn’t agree on what organic food was . So it’s one thing to say that there are standards that are followed , but those standards are completely different depending on who you talk to . So we should be clear that organic food means different things to different people . </s>
And let’s go back over these questions about marketing hype , because whether or not their explicit claims might be made by the organic producers and organic marketers , they are certainly claims that people who buy organic food believe and accept . And those claims are either that it’s better for you or its better for the environment . We’ve heard nothing this evening that really provides me with convincing evidence of either of those claims . </s>
Okay you may get more bio-diversity on an organic farm , but if we’re going to feed people with organic food , we need to turn more land into agriculture and do away with our natural parks and wildlife reserves . Is that tradeoff worth making ? </s>
I do n't know , but we have n't heard any evidence for it this evening . </s>
Do pesticides pose a risk ? Well , remember that organic farmers use insecticides , including one called Rotinone which is known to cause cancer in rats , is one of the most dangerous pesticides if you 're worried about carcinogens in your food . So if you 're worried about pesticide risk , do n't eat organic food , do n't eat conventional food . In fact , starve to death . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , John Krebs . our motion is “Organic food is marketing hype.” We 're in the closing statement section . And speaking against the motion , Jeffrey Steingarten : best-selling author and food critic for Vogue magazine . </s>
First of all , I assume that one of my debate partners , team partners , will be able to refute the one example given of a danger of something that 's used in organic food . There may be a lot of people in America who disagree about what organic food should mean . But we have a law . </s>
It 's very hard to read it , and it 's long . And it 's very exacting . </s>
There have been issues about whether it 's enforced strongly enough . </s>
But that would mean we should n't have speed limits because some people that I know exceed them . There 's no doubt about the environmental dangers of conventional agriculture . You may have read that in the Gulf of Mexico there is a dead zone , and it changes in size every year . It appears to come from all the nitrogen that is dumped into the Mississippi River for a thousand , 2,000 miles all the way from Chicago . And it gets into the Gulf of Mexico , and it deprives plants and fish of oxygen . </s>
The size of the dead zone two years ago was about the size of New Jersey in the middle of the Gulf of Mexico . There is no doubt to me that conventional agriculture is doomed . The only question is how soon . </s>
There is -- conventional agriculture requires lots of water , an even , steady climate , a monoculture and none these conditions -- Your time is up . Thank you very much . Our motion is “Organic food is marketing hype.” </s>
And summarizing his position in support of this motion , Blake Hurst , a farmer and vice president of the Missouri Farm Bureau . The longest term study and the go-to reference , if you look up organic yields , was done at the Institute . They had two organic plots , one which used manure as a fertilizer source . </s>
We do n't have enough manure to fertilize all the acres that are in crops today . We would need 5 billion -- 5 billion more cows in order to produce enough manure to use that much fertilizer . The other crop used a long rotation of using legumes and corn two years out of five , where legumes , in order to produce the nitrogen for the corn or the cash crop the next year . So there you have it . </s>
That 's the final point . Organic food in any given year can produce the same as conventional food . </s>
But over that five- year period , it only produced 60 percent as much . 60 percent as much . Two years ago , we were at a 30-year low in food stocks and cereal grain stocks . </s>
Countries were banning the export of rice even here in the U.S . They limited the amount of rice you could buy because of the short supply . They were trying to cut down on hoarding . We can have food problems . We ca n't solve them . </s>
We ca n't have hunger problems . We ca n't solve them with organic production . We Americans take a plentiful supply of food for granted . And we 've forgotten that the history of the world is a long search for food security . We have to remember that the history of agriculture is not a long crime , not a sort of industrial fall from grace , but rather the greatest success story the world has ever seen . </s>
The advances in farming and the application of technology to production of food have made us better fed , safer , healthier and richer . </s>
Those are very good things , and we should give thanks for our good fortune . </s>
And that 's why you should vote in favor of this motion . Thank you , Blake Hurst . Our motion is `` Organic food is marketing hype . '' And summarizing her position against the motion is Urvashi Rangan who is director of technical policy for the Consumers Union . Thank you . </s>
Our opponents have just been off topic this entire evening , and the resolution is not about yield and how much organic yields versus conventional . </s>
Does it yield more or less ? It 's not about whether organic feeds the world or not . That 's not the resolution . </s>
The resolution is whether it 's marketing hype . </s>
John on the other side , brought up , it does n't offer health benefits . It does n't , so therefore it 's marketing hype . </s>
It was never designed to be a healthier food product for you , the human being . It turns out there are some inadvertent benefits about being healthier to the environment . </s>
And that 's what it was designed for . And it turns out when we 're better to the environment , and we 're better to the animals that we raise , and we do n't soak these animals and the ground they 're on with drugs and chemicals and heavy metals , it turns out that might be better for us too . </s>
And that is in fact why organic is not marketing hype . It began as something that was positive for the earth . And my opponents did not refute not a single of my first three points in terms of poop being fed to animals . John , the U.K. closed up all the loopholes with animal feed with mad cow . We did n't do that . </s>
And so organic offers that tangible benefit . </s>
We mitigate those exposures in organic food production . Secondly , with antibiotics , we have a big problem with the resistance of bacteria at antibiotics . Our opponents had no response whatsoever to that point . There is a tangible danger associated with conventional production . And we feed animals heavy metals . </s>
Just today , the inspector general of the USDA came out with a report showing residues of heavy metals , chemicals and drugs in meat . It 's there . It 's in the meat . Organic does n't use those things . And therefore , organic is not marketing hype . </s>
We urge you to vote against this resolution . Thank you , Urvashi Rangan . Our motion is `` Organic food is marketing hype . '' </s>
And summarizing his support for the motion , Dennis Avery , director of the Hudson Institute , Center for Global Food Issues . Bruce Ames , University of California Berkeley , one of the most knowledgeable cancer researchers in the world , tested pesticides , tested first synthetic pesticides and found about half of them caused cancer in rats at high doses . He was applauded by the organic movement . </s>
Then he started testing natural compounds and whether they caused rat -- cancer in rats at high doses . </s>
And about half of them did . And this is where Dr. Krebs got his point about the 46 carcinogens in the coffee . And the actual reality is that 99.99 percent of the carcinogens that you ingest are from Mother Nature . They 're there mostly in the plant foods that we eat and consume and brew . And there if you 're eating organic food at all this additional expense , you might be reducing your exposure to cancer by something on the order of 1/10,000 of 1 percent . </s>
I was a little surprised to find that we were also here tonight to discuss the pig poo in the waters of the state of North Carolina . But since I have in fact analyzed the data on that particular question , I can tell you that there has been no change in the water quality in North Carolina since they started growing hogs down there . There is a problem with the water quality below the cities because the sewage treatment plants do n't deal adequately with the people poo . </s>
Dennis Avery , your time is up . Not the pig . </s>
Thank you very much . </s>
And that concludes this intelligence squared U.S. debate . </s>
And now it is time to learn which side has argued best . We are asking you in the audience to choose our winner . We 're asking you to go to the keypad , to the right of each seat . Our motion is “Organic food is marketing hype.” </s>
If you agree with the motion after hearing these arguments , press Number 1 . If you are against the motion , you disagree after hearing these arguments , push Number 2 . If you remain or became undecided , push number three . And we will have the readout on these results almost instantaneously . Before we announce the results of the votes , I just want to -- first of all , I want to thank -- this is different from other debates that we 've had in some ways . </s>
And I really want to thank the panels for making it so spirited and so interesting , so thank you to all of you . So I want to let you know that our next debate will be on Tuesday , May 8th . The motion is “Obama 's Foreign Policy Spells America 's Decline.” </s>
Panelists for the motion are Andrew Card , former Chief of Staff for President George W. Bush , and Dan Senor , a former Pentagon and White House advisor .

We will be in Washington , D.C. for our first ever debate outside of New York City on Tuesday , June 8th , at the Newseum . </s>
The motion there will be “The Cyber War Threat Has Been Grossly Exaggerated.” I expect to see all of you on the shuttle on the way down . Our guests there will include top cyber security experts including the former Director of the NSA , retired Vice Admiral Mike McConnell .

Before the debate , on the motion Organic Food is Marketing Hype , before the debate , 21 percent of you were for the motion , 45 percent were against the motion , and 34 percent were undecided . After the debate , 21 percent remained for the motion , 69 percent are against , 10 percent are undecided . The side against the motion wins . </s>
Congratulations to them . Thank you from me , John Donvan , and from Intelligence Squared U.S . Okay , then I’m going to go ahead and introduce the man responsible for this whole shebang here , Robert Rosenkranz , who is chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , the sponsor of Intelligence Squared , who’s going to frame tonight’s debate . </s>
Bob ? Thank you . Well , you know , the notion of a market in human organs , just strikes many as ethically or morally repugnant . Certainly those who choose to sell their organs will be predominantly poor . </s>
And , is it not exploitation to take advantage of their duress ? </s>
Doesn’t this make the growing inequalities between rich and poor rise to a new and disturbing level ? Is the human dignity of people who sell their organs compromised ? And , and more pragmatically , might the existence of a market create incentives for fraud or dishonesty . Might it undermine the altruism that drives our current model . </s>
Well , it’s hard to dispute that the current model has serious flaws . Some 75,000 in this country are on the waiting list for kidney transplants . In the next year , only 18,000 will receive them . </s>
Within that year nearly 4000 will die , another 1200 or more will become too sick to transplant . Those on dialysis , have a seriously impaired quality of life , and about half the life expectancy of those receiving transplants . </s>
The argument in favor of a market solution , is grounded in basic economics . </s>
If you want to increase the supply of available organs , you need to create incentives for donors , is the argument . </s>
The easiest case may be a family death benefit , for those who agree to be organ donors when they apply for driver’s licenses , and whose organs are actually used . This addresses the need for livers , lungs , hearts and other transplantable organs . But kidney transplants are the most common , the only organ available from living donors . The—and this is a case that dramatizes the nexus between freedom of contract and personal liberty . </s>
Suppose you or your child needs a kidney , and you agree to pay a sum , say $ 25,000 , to a donor . Well in many parts of the world , such a sum is life-changing . Suppose $ 25,000 enables the donor to get health care for his parents , or an education for his children . Both sides to this bargain receive benefits powerful to them . </s>
And there’s no obvious harm to anybody else . So why should this contract be illegal ? When legislators who find such bargains repugnant pass laws imposing their views , they are quite literally causing sick people to die . How can this be morally acceptable ? </s>
Before closing , I’d like to note that this is the final debate of our spring season , and our final debate at Asia Society . This has been a wonderful venue for us , but all of our debates have been sold out and we’ve had to turn hundreds away . We begin again in September at Casprey Auditorium at Rockefeller University , 66th Street and York Avenue . Our new venue is substantially bigger and will meet the demand for the kind of elevated public discourse we at IQ Squared try to provide . Tonight’s resolution is a great example . </s>
It raises issues of ethics and economics , and morality , and mortality . We have an outstanding panel and a stellar moderator in Ira Flatow , a veteran NPR science correspondent , award-winning TV journalist . Ira , the evening is yours . Thank you , Bob , thank you very much , Bob Rosenkranz . </s>
If at any time during the evening you forget what we’re talking about , right behind me , is a big billboard…with the names of the guests and panelists , we’ve divided them up into…I’m not gon na say left and right , let’s just say pro and con or for and against , for and against is how we’ll describe it . The topic for discussion is , “We should legalize the market for human organs , ” pro or con , yes or no , and you actually vote , if you look at the keypad—there’s a keypad attached to the armrest on your left , it should look something like this . No money is going to come out of it if you put in a— Well , I don’t know , maybe something will happen . </s>
Now when I prompt you , we’re gon na do—we’re going to take a vote before and then after the debate , and see if your mind has been changed or if you have any different ideas after listening to the debate . And so after I prompt you , press “1” for the motion , “We should legalize the market for human organs , ” or “2” to vote against . And if you’re one of the great undecideds , you can even go for “3.” So it is “1” for the motion , “2” against , and “3” if you are undecided . You can vote now . </s>
Do I do the “Jeopardy” music here ? I don’t think so . We’re going to reveal the outcome of the votes later in the evening , but let’s get right on to the main topic of discussion . I’m going to introduce the panel , and , they’re all well-known people so please , hold your applause until all six are introduced . Now we have for the motion , professor of law at the end of the table , at George Mason University , Lloyd Cohen . </s>
He’s Director of Transplantation and Professor of Surgery at SUNY Upstate Medical University , Amy Friedman— Segued too fast to Amy Friedman . Okay . She’s Director of Transplantation and Professor of Surgery at SUNY Upstate Medical University . </s>
Next to her is Sally Satel , she is a psychiatrist and Resident Scholar at the American Enterprise institute for Public Policy Research . Against the motion on my left , we have the Professor of Ethics at the University of Virginia , and Director of the Institute for Practical Ethics in Public Life , James Childress . Welcome . Professor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School and Director of Medical Affairs for the Transplantation Society , Francis Delmonico . And on the end , Professor of Social Medicine and Director of the Center on Medicine as a profession at Columbia University , David Rothman . </s>
Welcome all to the program , let’s begin the debate . </s>
I’m going call each member of the debating team to the podium , in order , and they’re going to give us their viewpoint and then we’ll move on from there and continue our debate , and first up , in the order of debate , for the proposition is Sally Satel . Sally ? Thank you . </s>
Today there are 75,000 people waiting for kidneys . </s>
I would still be one of them , but thank goodness , a wonderful friend of mine gave me her right kidney two years ago . But thousands of others are not going to be as lucky as I was . In New York City in fact , patients suffer on dialysis , can suffer for up to eight years before getting a transplant , and so many of them can’t survive that long . </s>
Despite decades and decades of public education about the virtues of organ donation , the waiting list just gets longer , and the time to transplantation just gets longer . So it’s no surprise that desperate patients take matters into their own hands and try to find their own organs . They rent billboards begging people to give them—to save them . They join on-line matching services to find a donor , in fact I did that . </s>
Some of them go abroad , and maybe if they go abroad to a place like China , they have to live with the sickening knowledge that the organ they got came from an executed prisoner . </s>
But you can’t blame these people . They are just trying to save their lives . Now bless all the altruistic souls who have donated organs . </s>
But it’s past time to face the fact that altruism is just not enough . Many people need more of an incentive to give . And that’s why we need to be able to compensate people who are willing to give a kidney to a stranger , to save a life . </s>
Here’s one proposal . The government should sponsor a regulated system for living donors . </s>
Compensation could be something as simple as a contribution to a retirement fund , a tax credit , tuition voucher for the children , possibly health care , all kinds of creative things we could do to benefit people who are willing to give a kidney . And as I said , since the government will be paying , not the patient , everyone can benefit . Now what about the donors . Would the promise of a reward exploit donors whose poverty makes the offer seem impossible to refuse ? That’s an important consideration . </s>
But a distinction needs to be made . It’s not low-income people who will rush to judgment , and make rash decisions . It’s desperate people . No one wants someone giving up a kidney because they’re in such financial desperation . </s>
But , this is something we can guard against . For example we simply don’t offer what desperate people want . Which is immediate cash . </s>
So you can build in several months of a waiting period , you can offer the kind of in-kind compensation I mentioned before . I mean , I can go on and on about details of how a system could be constructed . But , you get the idea , I mean you’ve heard the basic idea . Now , what I want to do , is have you hear some of the misguided objections that our opponents are going to wage . You may well hear that any effort to legalize rewards for donors , will end up creating a system that will look exactly like the corrupt organ bazaars that permeate the Third World , in this donors are almost considered no more than cattle , and their organs go to the highest bidder . </s>
That is exactly wrong . We are talking about a transparent , regulated system of exchange , under the rule of law , in which donor protections are paramount . In fact , what we’re talking about is the exact opposite of a black market . </s>
The donor is free to decide if participating is in his best interest , and then if it is , something miraculous happens . He saves someone with his kidney . </s>
You may also hear that the transplant list is really not that bad , it’s kind of bogus , it’s inflated . </s>
Really , we don’t have to do anything drastic . </s>
Well , we do have to do something drastic , because , of the 75,000 people on the list , it is true , not every one of them is eligible to get a kidney tomorrow . About a third of them are what’s called inactive , meaning that right now they are too sick , if a kidney became available to them tomorrow , they would have to be passed over , because they’re not ready to— they’re too fragile for surgery . But why did that happen ? </s>
It happened because they waited years and years and deteriorated so far during that time , that now they couldn’t get an organ . </s>
Tragically these were people who were healthy when they were first listed . So if anything , the glut , the one-third of folks who are ineligible to get a kidney today , is a sign for urgency , not complacency . You’ll also hear that the transactions involving organs , any transaction involving organs , is an affront to human dignity . </s>
But no one can ever explain to me how a fair , safe , and respectable implementation of incentives is an affront to anyone . But what is a disgraceful assault on human dignity , is to sit by and let people die when we have the means to save them . You’ll hear that organs and material gain don’t mix . Well , I reject this . </s>
Beautiful acts are performed every day by people who are moved by a combination of humanitarian and financial motives . </s>
Are firemen who rush into a burning building any less heroic in our eyes because they were paid to save us ? In the end , our critics have a chilling message for patients . Shut up , wait on line , and pray that you’re not one of the 14 people who will die today because no organ became available for you . Now don’t get me wrong , altruism is a beautiful virtue . </s>
It should and will continue if there is a parallel system— One minute , one minute— —of compensating donation . I know it’s a beautiful virtue because I’m a poster girl for it . </s>
But I also know the deadly consequences of following the same failed policy . It’s something we can’t do , and why you must vote for our side . Thank you . Thank you , Sally . </s>
Up next speaking against the resolution , is James Childress . Defenders of markets for organs often charge that the opponents of a market appeal to the emotions of repugnance , and disgust , the yuck factor . They often imply that the only grounds any reasonable person could have for rejecting a market would be such emotions . Well tonight , we , the opponents of an organ market , will not appeal primarily to emotions . </s>
Indeed , I suspect that the proponents of a market will do so . Instead we will offer solid ethical , social , and cultural reasons not to legalize a market in organs . </s>
We ask you to consider very carefully , the reasons , the arguments for and against organ markets . Defenders of organ markets also tend to represent an extreme form of what I would call market fundamentalism . They suppose that , any time there’s a problem , such as shortage of organs , we should just throw that problem into the marketplace , and magically , miraculously , the problem will be solved . Market fundamentalism neglects the full range of relevant social values , especially justice and fairness which I will emphasize , and the probable negative effects of a market in organs , which my colleagues will stress . </s>
Markets are truly wonderful mechanisms . But they may not be the best mechanism , for organ transfers . Defenders of organ markets appeal to two great social-ethical values , very important ones . Liberty , people should be free to sell their body parts if they want to . </s>
Utility , a market in organs would produce the greatest good for the greatest number . </s>
Libertarians affirming liberty , utilitarians affirming utility , take these values and join together in an unstable alliance , in support of a market in organs . </s>
But both neglect another equally important value , justice , or fairness . As a result they ignore or downplay the injustice or unfairness of exploiting poor and disadvantaged people , as sources of transplantable organs . An illegal or legal organ markets , the main vendors or sellers , and yes , that’s what they are . </s>
They’re not paid donors , they are vendors and sellers . They tend to be poor and disadvantaged , or desperate . Of course we could devise a system of compensation for organs that would avoid some injustice and some unfairness , by separating procurement from distribution . Take the unfairness of a rich person’s purchase of organs . We can eliminate that , by having a single purchaser of organs , who would then distribute the organs according to a fair scheme , for example , to patients most in need . </s>
But we can not avoid the poor , disadvantaged , desperate person’s sale . And we should not introduce an organ market into a society with major and increasing inequalities in wealth and advantage . If we did so , we would not , should not expect a positive outcome . Why not . </s>
Well consider two possibilities . One possible target of an organ market or compensation system , would aim to increase—would be to increase the number of organs from dead people . Let’s call those cadaveric organs . Another would be to increase the organs from living vendors . Some of the same objections apply to both , for example financial compensation may crowd out donation , especially altruistic donation . </s>
But there are differences . Take first a cadaveric organ market . There are strong reasons to believe that compensation for cadaveric organs won’t increase the supply . </s>
Imagine a futures market in organs where individuals contract to provide their organs after their deaths , and in return receive a payment now , or designate the payment to be provided after their deaths to their families , or to a charity . </s>
Why wouldn’t that work , it seems so obvious . Well , consider that many people don’t sign donor cards now because of distrust or mistrust . They worry about being declared dead prematurely , or even having their deaths hastened , if they have signed a donor card . Well they would certainly be reluctant to enter a futures market , to sign a futures contract , when the only barrier to the delivery of their organs , is the fact that they’re not dead yet . Or consider the family sale . </s>
Individuals would have similar reasons to block families from making decisions because of conflicts of interest . And many families would be reluctant to be viewed as profiting from a family member’s death . </s>
We do not need to try such a futile market . There are other options for obtaining cadaveric organs . Our current system works fairly well , and can be improved . Indeed , we’re second only to Spain in the number of deceased donor organs obtained per million population . </s>
And there are several potential improvements that we can make , some are already underway . We can increase education and the use of donor cards and donor registries . And , when an individual’s not made a decision , we can do a better job in approaching— approaching families after their deaths . Some institutions now obtain consent to donation , from 70 to 75 percent of families of patients declared dead by neurological standards , who are potential candidates for organ donation . And we can consider other sources including those declared dead by cardiopulmonary standards . </s>
But now let’s consider a living organ market , mainly for kidneys since people can live , usually live and function well with only one of their two kidneys . In 2007 there were roughly 7250 deceased kidney donors , and 6000 living kidney donors— One minute . </s>
A living organ market would probably work better than compensation with cadaveric organs , but there are other problems that my colleagues will emphasize . In conclusion…a market is not an idea whose time has come . </s>
A market in organs is a bad idea . It is unnecessary , probably ineffective , possibly counterproductive , and would breach our sense of justice by exploiting poor , disadvantaged , and desperate members of our society . Hence we should not legalize a market in human organs . </s>
Thank you , James Childress . Up next , for , is Amy Friedman . As a surgeon , I view the body with reverence . The rights and dignity of every patient are paramount . My expertise is to—is sustaining lives by transplanting organs . </s>
It is my inability to do so , because I don’t have the organs to offer , that has persuaded me that rewarding the donor is appropriate . </s>
Our opponents tonight would have me tell patients to stay the course . Wait with dignity for the organ that may never come . This message is poorly received , as it should be . Our opponents may tell you , that the waiting list is too long , because it includes the wrong people . </s>
I don’t see wrong people , I see human beings , each of whose lives might well be lengthened and improved if I could give them an organ . </s>
Desperate patients unwilling to die waiting have fueled a black market , whose magnitude is inadequately quantified , though certainly disturbing in scope . </s>
What is known , is that organs are purchased , third-party brokers siphon funds away from donors , and safety is uncertain for both the recipient or the donor . Efforts to shut this market have been as unsuccessful as Prohibition was in inducing an end to the use of alcohol . I agree with our opponents that the black market must be closed . </s>
I disagree with asking patients to accept death gracefully , instead of resorting to the black market . My position is that development of a legal , regulated mechanism for donor compensation is the only means of effectively eliminating the demand for this covert activity , closing down the black market , and improving safety for donors and recipients . </s>
Today , we educate the kidney patient and family , hoping that a volunteer donor will step forward to surrender a kidney . Most transplant surgeons agree , there would be no justification for ever removing a kidney from a living donor , potentially causing harm to this healthy person , if there were sufficient organs from deceased donors . Why ? It may surprise you , that we still can not tell this volunteer donor about all of the risks that kidney donation entails . Sure , the early risks , such as death , are known , but the long-term consequences are not , particularly for some of the more marginal donors being used in some cases . </s>
Nevertheless , we allow and celebrate such a healthy person’s choice to donate , and allow him to accept unknown risks for which there is no compensation . Why are we surprised that more donations don’t take place ? Transplanters share nearly universal agreement , that these genuine heroes need lifelong health insurance and intermittent medical supervision . </s>
Dr. Delmonico has written that all living donors should be provided with life and disability insurance . But in today’s reality , we have no mechanism for providing these protections . Yet we are not deterred from removing the kidney . The operation itself , and our fees , are covered by the recipient’s insurance . </s>
The opportunity to save a life persuades us and the donor to proceed . </s>
Compensation for the organ donor’s time and risks , by providing life insurance , lifelong health insurance , and even a direct monetary fee , is more appropriate than for the donation of an egg , the rental of a uterus for a surrogate pregnancy , or the participation in clinical experimentation , all of which are legal . We are talking about saving lives . Let’s also recognize that everyone else involved in the transplant prospers . The recipient gains the organ , life itself . The surgeons , transplant center , and for kidney transplants , even the American taxpayer , you and I , have direct financial benefit when a patient comes off dialysis . </s>
Isn’t it disingenuous to exclude the donor from sharing in the tangible benefits resulting from his gift of life ? A reasonable system must include protection from nefarious third parties , and be guaranteed by centralized , independent oversight , that ensures equal accessibility to those in need , regardless of their economic means . Lastly and most crucially , a transparent , informed consent process must be the mandatory condition of participation . Our opponents may suggest that payment would be so coerced , as to prevent the donor from giving informed consent . This is paternalistic . </s>
Why should financial need prevent one’s ability to consider the balanced presentations of risk and benefit that donors consider in the currently regulated informed-consent process . This is an insult to the poor , in suggesting they are incapable of balanced thought and self-determination . Reasonable people rationalize risk daily , by personal prerogative , at times subjecting themselves to unhealthy conditions , and making unsafe choices such as working deep in the coalmine . Any informed decision balances risk against the prospect of benefit . Though real , the risks of organ donation are likely substantially lower than those assumed by coal miners seeking their livelihoods . </s>
Despite the dangers inherent in both cases , the miner but not the donor is legally compensated for these risks . The key difference is dependence on the participation of medical providers , White House are dedicated to doing no harm , to facilitate payment for the gift of life . Therefore , according a donor— One minute , one minute— —the highest degree of protection throughout necessitates the involvement of the most highly-trained individuals , and the conditions of greatest safety . </s>
This is precisely what does not happen on the black market , where transplants and donations are conducted covertly . There is no dignity in dying without a transplant . Don’t blame the patient for listening to his internal will to live . </s>
We must offer protection to the donor who answers the recipient’s call , in a way that is currently legally prohibited . Vote with us to legitimize compensation for the donor’s acceptance of risk . </s>
Today , the choice is not whether compensation will exchange hands , but whether or not transplant operations and the sale of organs will be regulated and safe . Thank you . </s>
Up next , speaking against the resolution is Francis Delmonico . </s>
So I’m a transplant surgeon , and I’ve been involved in transplantation care , oh , for more than 35 years . And , I’ve had the opportunity to travel around this world , to know about transplantation practices , and what we’re discussing here tonight . </s>
I mentioned to Robert , wherever he is , that there’s a global impact , of what would be from the United States . What we do here , has a profound influence on the rest of the world . </s>
Now , I say that because I’ve been to Manila . </s>
And Amy , I should say , it’s not a matter of balanced thought , when a 14-year-old has to sell a kidney , to an American that comes there . It’s not a matter of balanced thought in Pakistan , or in Egypt . What’s been missing , in what you’ve heard , is what would that system look like . </s>
Legalize the market for human organs , what would that be . </s>
Amy has mentioned that…shouldn’t be a black market . </s>
Shouldn’t be covert . It’s not a black market in the sense of covert in Manila , or in Lahore , Pakistan , or in Egypt . It’s very well-known . </s>
It’s very transparent , and aware what the situation is . What’s been missing in the debate thus far is , what would this look like , or have to look like , in the United States . And is that indeed attainable . So , if we are to go down this road of a market , what might that be that—we haven’t actually heard , what might that be , to make it transparent , or regulated . Well , there’d have to be a fixed price for the kidney . </s>
Now I wan na say something that comes across my mind… I wish to provide care for donors . There should be no mistaking that , and I wish to expand every opportunity there can be , in providing for the people on this list . </s>
And that entails care for live donors , that does not exist . But it can’t be a cash payment . It can’t be a market , given the global context of medical tourism and markets . So let me take you back to…what would this be . </s>
Well , those that have written about this say it would have to be a fixed price . There’d have to be a prohibition of brokers . </s>
There’d have to be a prohibition of Internet arrangements . </s>
The kidneys would have to be distributed along with deceased donor kidneys , by the UNOS system . </s>
The kidneys would only be available by this , quote- unquote , market system . The vendors and the buyers would have to be restricted to the country of residence . It would only be that the vendor could be within the United States , and so too the recipient . Now just for a moment , I want to ask of a reality check about all of those issues , and whether or not you all could conclude that that in this global environment , of medical tourism , would indeed be attainable . Do you think that such a market could be with a fixed price and a prohibition of brokers and a prohibition of Internet arrangements and only distributed through this system . </s>
And that the vendors and buyers would have to be restricted to the United States . Now , in the interest of time—we can’t go through all of those—let’s just start by thinking of that . </s>
Fixed price for a kidney . Fixed cash payment . </s>
That’s impossible . It’s impossible because there’s no market justification to fix a price . </s>
Markets deal in best prices , in cheapest prices . </s>
Patients go from the Middle East to Manila because it’s the cheapest price . </s>
And , why shouldn’t there be a cheap price , if we’re going to condone markets in the United States , what is the expectation that insurance companies , brokers and patients would simply wait here , why wouldn’t they , with now a legalize market in the United States , go and shop . Shopping is Manila , shopping is Pakistan , shopping is India . Shopping is South America . There are plenty of cheap prices . The prohibition of brokers in this regulated market . </s>
The insurance companies become brokers , when they send patients from Israel to Manila . It’s the cheapest price . </s>
About 20 patients a month go from Israel to Manila , because of cheap prices . </s>
If there’s a market legalized in the United States , in the global context of medical tourism , do you think that the 72— </s>
One minute . —72-year-old patient on the list , would wait for a kidney here , versus going to buy a 20-year-old kidney in Manila ? I want to bring to attention something about the list , and we’ll do more about this and we can amplify this in our discussion . </s>
But there is this piece that I want to just very carefully ask -- we better evaluate this wait list . The contention that all on the list would have lived had they gotten a kidney , may not be a reality either . </s>
And I’ll wish to amplify that , one other piece…to say that it’s unethical not to permit kidney sales because kidney patients are dying on the list overlooks the unethical development of committing heart and lung and liver and pancreas and intestine patients to die because kidney sales will impact deceased transplantation in this country . </s>
It does it around the world . </s>
Go to Hong Kong . Dr. Delmonico , you— Thank you , Ira . Sum up . Thank you— </s>
We’ll talk more about this aspect— We’ll have more time for discussion later , we’ll have a discussion period , we’ll also have a question-and-answer period from the audience— Thank you— —that you can follow up , I have a couple of— Thank you very much . I just have a couple of follow-up questions that struck me , and you made a—raise a couple interesting points , folks on this side did also , now I’ll ask one question for each side . </s>
And we’ll go on to the debaters . </s>
And that is this question about what role do the insurance companies have in this , this is a good point that Dr. Delmonico made . I mean , we now have to go to our HMO’s , to our health care providers for just—they make just about every decision that influences our health care . Are they now gon na decide whether you get a—in your system that you’re proposing—would they decide whether you’re able to get a kidney or not , you’re healthy enough , you’re not healthy enough , you should be getting one , you shouldn’t be one , I’m not gon na pay for it , I’m not gon na pay for the trip , I’m not gon na pay for the medication , whatever , what role would they have , people are so disgusted with them already , are they going to become more disgusted with a government-run system , even though it’s regulated . </s>
You’re going to ask a physician what role the insurance companies should have— </s>
Yes , that’s like picking out a— No role . </s>
No , it’s— You know , in general— Well how is that possible in the system that we have now ? Because in general the insurance companies generally follow Medicare and government guidelines , and as long as the—we set up something that is reasoned , logical and supportable , it’s hard for them to not follow . So do we get to respond to that— No , we’ll get , a little later we get to respond to that . </s>
I’m not through with the question yet . So if everybody acts very reasonably then , this will work—do you know anybody who acts very reasonably all the time about things like this ? Well I—I shouldn’t comment on that . </s>
But I will say that , you know , the concept of how this system would be created requires , um , involvement of multiple parties , in a similar manner to the way UNOS is set up . That there are not just providers , there are not just patients and family members , there are clergy , there are social workers , and yes , I think it would be reasonable to have some representatives from the major insurance companies for example to be part in the development of these multi-disciplinary panels as they agree on what is the best policy for doing this . It has to be a uniform policy , and the way the law would need to be written , and we do need a law written , this is obviously currently an illegal activity , so we definitely need legislative change , would be to require that these activities go through the single processor . Let me just ask the other doctor , Dr. Delmonico , a different question , we’ll get back to this later , you seem to feel very strongly about this issue . </s>
Do you think this is a strong enough issue that it should be brought up in this Presidential election year . Do you think this should influence the way we choose our candidates about where they stand perhaps , on this issue . Fine , yes I do . </s>
I think that…here’s how I think it . Medical tourism is going to be a very important aspect for all of us in this room . </s>
Countries are now seeking rich patients to come to that country for care . It becomes a very big industry . And , the social inequity of that is , on two ways . If you go to a South American country that is attracting patients to come there , they do so by then making it—patients within that country , unable to receive that care . Because there is an internal brain drain of sort , that is intended for the rich patients to arrive there . </s>
Deceased donation has been impacted in the Middle East , because you can go to Asia to buy a kidney . So , in this global context of medical tourism , I think our Presidential candidates are gon na have to think about this , yes indeed . Good questions , if we ever ask them a question about science or health , you know , if we ever get a chance . Okay , we’re going to— we have to move on—we have topics of discussion coming up later . </s>
Don’t shoot the messenger . </s>
We have to move right along here , next up for the resolution is , Lloyd Cohen . Ladies and gentlemen , I want to make the question before you as authentic and personal as possible . </s>
Imagine that when you leave here tonight , you learn that your child’s kidneys are failing and that without a transplant she will die . The problem for you is how to obtain an organ for her . She could receive one from a living donor , but she—and both she and the donor can live quite well with one healthy kidney . But what if no relative or friend is both compatible and willing to donate . </s>
Well , you look to be , a reasonably well-heeled , group , so perhaps you might pay someone to supply her this superfluous kidney , and thereby save your child’s life . </s>
Alas , that would be illegal . You , the vendor , and anyone who aids you in this will be subjected to imprisonment . Odd , isn’t it . </s>
That if she were attacked by an assailant , you are permitted to use deadly force to save her life . But when she is attacked by disease , you may not pay a willing vendor to provide an organ . Perhaps this rests on the principle that the rich should not get what the poor are precluded from obtaining . Well then . A private charity or government agency should step in and purchase organs from willing donors , and distribute them on the basis of need . </s>
No . That is also forbidden . No one , no institution , no government agency may pay a living donor . Well then , perhaps she can receive a deceased donor organ . </s>
Yes , if she is lucky . Now as it happens something between 25 percent and 60 percent of organs suitable for transplantation , are recovered from the deceased . What happens to the rest . They are buried and burned . </s>
Why doesn’t a private party or a charity or the government step in and purchase those life-saving organs . </s>
Bizarre as this may sound , the law draws no distinctions between organs from the living and organs from the deceased . Here too , offering or accepting compensation for a deceased donor organ , is a felony . Our position , is not that every conceivable market in human organs is ethically acceptable . Rather , it is that at least some are . Our opponents on the other hand , object to , and would prohibit , any and all personal reward being offered to providers of organs . </s>
They oppose payments for living donation . They oppose payments to next of kin for the organs of a deceased relative . </s>
They propose offering an options contract to healthy people for delivery of their organs after death . They even oppose the life-sharer system of giving a priority to transplant organs , to those willing to make the commitment to their own deceased organ donation . Though in this debate we are not arguing in favor of any particular proposal to reward providers , I will outline one such proposal , the one with which I am most closely associated—an options market in deceased donor organs . </s>
I do so in part because I crafted his proposal precisely to try to accommodate every ethical objection I had heard , whether I thought it worthy or not . I leave it to you to judge if there is any substantial ethical objection that should bar its adoption . The market I propose is one in which healthy individuals might contract for the sale of their organs and tissue for delivery after their death . If the vendors’ organs are received and transplanted , a payment in the range of $ 5000 for each major organ would be made to a person or institution chosen by the donor . </s>
What of the objection to the poor being coerced by poverty to endanger their health by selling their organs ? I repeat . In an options market , organs would only be acquired from the dead . </s>
No one need be induced or even permitted to sacrifice his health or bodily integrity for money . The donation of the organs of the deceased by both rich and poor is currently strongly encouraged , precisely because most of us believe that surrendering the organ represents no sacrifice to the donor . But doesn’t employing a market mean that organs will be allocated on the basis of willingness to pay , and so the rich will be able to buy organs that the poor are precluded from obtaining . </s>
Some things it is believed are literally too vital to permit their allocation by ability to pay . Had I the time , I would challenge this objection , and argue that there are fewer ethical problems in allowing people to sacrifice their own treasure to save the lives of those they love , than exist under all—what I , but not my colleague Dr. Friedman , view as the self-righteous yet cramped and craven and misguided UNOS system of allocation . But alas , time does not allow for that . </s>
For now I must underscore that my proposed options market does not speak to the question of to whom the organs will be allocated , only how they will be acquired from the original owner and possessor . My proposal is consistent with and can accommodate any conceivable system of acquisition and allocation , including , purchase by a government agency , allocation solely on the basis of medical criteria , and provision to recipients at no charge . Note also , that the options market does not require next of kin to traffic in the flesh of their loved ones . </s>
Instead it is one in which people contract to sell their own organs when they are healthy for delivery after their death , thereby taking the next of kin out of the decision-making process . The central premise not merely of my proposal , but of all the others as well , is an obvious , even banal economic proposition . If you compensate people for something , they will provide more of it than if you don’t . </s>
Every economist who has written on the question including Nobel Prize-winner Gary Becker , has argued in favor of using personal incentives to increase the supply of transplant organs . The price of the prohibition on the sale of human organs , is the death of many thousands of people each year . One minute . Were the suffering and death of the victims of this pernicious policy more visible , the stale and empty pieties about the sacred human body being despoiled by the profane market would be revealed for the vacuous moral posturings that they are . Such moralizing rather than reflecting an adherence to noble principles , instead bespeaks a fanatical adherence to abstract , inapposite principles , by those who are well isolated from the horrific human consequences of their folly . </s>
It is not the payment for organs that offends human dignity , but rather the fanatical unwillingness to save thousands of lives by permitting such payments , that is a great offense to human dignity . Thank you . Our final speaker against the proposition is David Rothman . </s>
The question that’s on the slide behind me , “We should legalize the market for human organs , ” is a very prominent one , becoming more prominent over the last year or two . </s>
And you’ve heard from our opponents some of the reasons for the prominence . I want to focus you clearly on what this one means . It’s not what you just heard from Lloyd Cohen , about a futures option . That’s a wrinkle with building on cadavers . </s>
What this is really about , is the sale of organs from living donors . When you go to vote , you’ve got to think not about the cadaver , not about , you know , giving the family a little bit of a burial expense . You have got to think about , do we want to be in a system where we pay people to give us their kidneys . That’s the question . </s>
Now I’m going to propose a variety of reasons to you , why I think that would be totally misguided , indeed maybe even self-defeating . Let me start with the first problem . And that is that although it seems very commonsensical to think that if we make a market it will increase the supply , there are very , very good reasons , many drawn from behavioral economics , some drawn from past experience , that suggest that in fact , to create a market might diminish the supply , not increase it . In the first instance , if I can buy it why should I give it . All right , a family member comes down with kidney disease—please do remember there is dialysis as well , this is not just simply life-death . </s>
Family member comes down , yes , I could give it , but I’m , you know , I’ve been pretty well-off these days , I can buy it . Yes , the risk is minimal , but why should I take any risk , if I can go out and put down X-teen thousands of dollars to purchase a kidney . It wouldn’t make any sense , I wouldn’t have my children donate if I could purchase . Don’t think easily that , if you create the market , altruism will not dissipate . </s>
There’s a wonderful example of this , the name should be familiar to some of you at least , Richard Titmus , English sociologist who studied blood donations in England and the US . What he discovered is that in England , where the sale of blood was not allowed , rates of donation were considerably higher than the US , where the sale of blood was allowed , eventually we move away from sale . The Titmus data’s pretty convincing , watch out about markets . Another example of this , I’ll do it rapidly but it’s a great study , took place in an Israeli nursery . </s>
Four o’clock in the afternoon you were supposed to pick up your child . Most made it , some didn’t make it . And there was lateness , you excused yourself , you felt bad , and you tried not to do it again . </s>
Then some wise social scientist tried an experiment . </s>
They told the day care center , the day care center went along with this , let’s institute a fine . So they instituted a fine , on the theory that if we fine people for coming late , the amount of lateness will go down . You know of course what happened . No sooner did they institute the fine , than the rate of lateness went up . Why , it’s simple . </s>
It became not a moral obligation , not my duty to the caretakers , but a price . And if I could afford the price , I would come late . </s>
The data came in very nicely , these social scientists then added another wonderful little twist . They took away the fine , and then they watched the rate of lateness . </s>
What happened then ? The rate of lateness stayed high , much higher than before . Their bottom line , and they weren’t thinking of this in our context but it’s gorgeous , once a commodity , always a commodity . </s>
Don’t experiment easily , once a commodity , always a commodity . I want you to take a different kind of intellectual exercise now , than the ones— they’re a little gory and a little Dukakis— reminding of , you know , okay , your loved one needs an organ , what are you going to do . I want you to take a different exercise , and think a little bit about , what it would be like to live in a society where we had a market in organs . </s>
Roughly the price , much higher than the folks have been telling you , we could—we would probably , I mean The Economist put it at about 250,000 . Sake of argument , you get about $ 125,000 if you give your organ . Now , first response of course would be , well , the poor—I’m gon na come to the middle class in a moment . </s>
The poor , will be out there donating and haven’t we done well by them . From everything we know in Third World countries , the sale— Frank already mentioned Manila , it’s true in India . </s>
Everything we know about it , you sell your organ , you’re out of debt for a very short period of time , you’re back in debt , right thereafter . The reasons for your debt are not gon na be rescued by a sale . Secondly , imagine , even after this administration is gone , you have in your possession right there on either side of you , a $ 150,000 commodity . Medicaid , before you go on Medicaid , you will sell that organ ? </s>
I mean , think of the welfare system , where everybody’s got , you know , that kind of money , sitting right there— One minute— </s>
—and take it away without any problem . Folks say , you know , oh , we’ll keep the foreign from doing it . Why , if it’s such a great benefit , why not a green card , why not an immigrant . As you think about voting , just remember the great Emma Lazarus line on our Statue of Liberty , give me your tired , your poor , the wretched refuse of your teeming shores , dot-dot- dot , so we can have your kidney . Let me close in my 45 seconds , with what it would mean to your kids , and what it would mean to you if they could do it . </s>
We’ve got some good , enterprising folks from Wall Street in the audience I’m sure . 125,000 tax-free invested when you’re 18 , mighty tempting . When do you tell your prospective bride that you can pay the down payment , what do you do when your father-in-law turns to you and says have you sold your kidney yet . </s>
What do you— Time’s up— —when your kid comes—I’ll close with this— and he says , I want to go the Ivy League , not to my state school , and you as the parent say , I can’t afford it , but you’ve got your kidney . Thank you . I’m going to just take the opportunity before we move on , it’s the prerogative as the host or chair , whatever we call my seat , to ask a couple of questions about what we just heard and I want to ask Lloyd , who is very , very— feels very strongly about it—is very animated about this topic . </s>
You just sat here and listened to this . Gahhh ! Was… You know , he made a very emotional case about , you know , everything that you don’t believe in on this topic . What is your reaction to…you know , would you want to live in a society where a kidney sells , where all 18-to-20-year-olds can sell a kidney for $ 50,000 or $ 100,000 to pay for an education ? </s>
Are we going down the road to hell , do we— No . He—well . First of all , David , he wants you to answer a different question when you vote later . He wants it to be the question on live kidney sales . </s>
Well , that isn’t the resolution . The resolution is quite clear , should we legalize the market for human organs . So he gives you the list of horribles of the worst conceivable market , and says , vote against that . I tell you , there’s a slew of possible markets , many of them quite innocent including merely a cadaveric market . Clearly distinguishable . </s>
And that falls within this notion of a market in organs . Now , there’s no more reason to think that— or I can see no particular—I can’t imagine a society , in which people would feel pressured , you know , to sell an organ for cash . </s>
It’s an evasion . And it’s just a list of horribles , that doesn’t exist— Okay— </s>
—anywhere , and that will not exist here . David , you want to answer that ? I can do it quickly . </s>
Trust me , we wouldn’t be here , if we were talking about annuities for cadaveric organs . The reason we’re here— That’s “cadaver , ” right , “cadaveric”— Yes , sorry— Okay , just— </s>
No— My radio thing— Oh , okay— —coming through with it . We wouldn’t be here if we were talking about futures markets , we’re here for one— </s>
That’s not true . </s>
What— I’ve been arguing for this for 20 years— You— But you’re not what’s captured the public attention and you’re not what’s driving the interest . What’s driving the interest— Really— </s>
—is— You’re not . </s>
I’m very— What’s driving the interest is , donation from living folks . </s>
None of us—look , we could quibble over this or that with a futures market— already I thought we heard— So you’re willing to switch sides and come to— </s>
No , no , I’m not— </s>
—this side and be with me on that one . No—the reason why I wouldn’t switch sides— Ah— —with you , is because of my fear of the contagion effect . If we— </s>
Oh , the slippery slope nonsense— All right—gentlemen— Gentlemen— We will get a chance— </s>
There is no slope here— Gentlemen— There are sharp , clear ledges . I’m using the wrong phraseology . </s>
Maybe we shouldn’t call you gentlemen . Um— We’ll get this eventually , we’ll get to this , we , we have a time for open discussion , you can open that wound up again and it sounds like it’s got an interesting place to go . But let me move on and announce the result of our pre-debate vote , you all voted on the machines , you’d like to know how you voted . Let me begin by reading the results . They up there on the screen ? </s>
We had “for , ” 44 percent , “against , ” 27 percent , and “undecided , ” 29 percent . So it was a large… Well , we—it’s a large portion , I’ll read it , “for” was 44 percent , “against” 27 percent , and “undecided , ” 29 percent . So we had a more people who are undecided than who are against it , there’s a large percentage of people still trying to decide that vote . We’ll take the vote again later . So we’ll see how the debate may have changed your opinion , but let’s move on now because I think , things are just getting interesting . </s>
I’m going to have our panelists pose a question to the other side , one from each side , pose a question themselves and ask them if they have a question they’d like to have somebody answer . Let me begin with , on the “for” side , Sally Satel ? Okay , so I can address my question— You can ask a— </s>
Okay . Preferably to one of them . </s>
Yes , Dr. Childress , I wanted to ask you… In nineteen—I’m going to quote you something you wrote in 1992 . And then we work up . You said , “It would be odd to structure a system designed to promote altruistic behavior , with the result of saving human life”—and you’re referring to the UNOS system— “when a system that relied on financial incentives could save more lives.” So I took this to mean that an altruistic system would be preferable to an incentive system , if it saved more lives , an incentive system would be preferable to an altruistic system if it could be shown to save more lives . Well , okay , that was 1992 . </s>
Fast-forward 14 years to 2006 when you were the head of the Institute of Medicine Report on organ donation . </s>
And in answer to the question that the report posed , what should we do about even considering , even pursuing a pilot trial of incentives , you had said—or the report said , but I know you concurred—“it is not time yet.” Now the report spent a lot of time—I’ll be quick—on cadaver donation . </s>
I’ll just say very quickly…believe it or not , even though two million people die a year , perhaps 20,000 are eligible to become organ donors , it’s just not that easy to be eligible , as a cadaver , so even if we used every deceased person , there wouldn’t be enough . So your focus on deceased donation would not help . </s>
I’m all for it , let a thousand organs bloom , I’ve never heard a policy frankly I didn’t like , that would increase . But that’s not gon na be enough . So my question to you is— I was wondering when we’d get to that— </s>
—if not—we’ll get to—here it is . If it wasn’t time then , in 2006 , when is it going to be time . </s>
How many more people are going to have to die until we can have your permission , to finally , at least have a trial of incentives . </s>
First of all , I still affirm all those positions and they’re not incompatible with each other . </s>
Basically , my view is that , we should give the kind of system we have preference—and by the way , it’s not simply an altruistic system . People have a lot of different motives for donating organs . We get confused when we identify altruism with donation . People are often donating , say for example because they want to gain some meaning out of a tragedy that’s occurred . They may be donating as a living person , an organ again because of the relationships involved , but don’t have to do specifically with altruism . </s>
I think we have not yet given a fair chance to the system we have , in that we have not yet put the resources and energy into it . Okay ? That is one person’s judgment about it , I see Amy frowning a great deal but you’ll get to respond to it in a moment , I still have— Since the question was five minutes long I get that much time in response . </s>
It was actually two-thirty— It’s only three minutes . Now…there are only 13,000 to 16,000 people who are declared dead by neurological standards , who could probably donate organs . There are another , on a conservative estimate , 20,000-plus who are declared dead by cardiopulmonary standards , and that is a direction that the IRM report recommended , that at least merits a trial but since I happen to agree with Lloyd on this , not much else , but at least on this , that we ought to be giving preference to the cadaveric system over the living in part because as Amy noted , we actually don’t know a lot about the long-term risks , which we do need to know . </s>
So it’s a matter of structuring this in terms of preferential systems , and the IRM report did not rule it out completely , that held , that let’s— Okay— —see if this will work . I’m going to give you an opportunity now , James , to ask a question if you’d like . You don’t have to— </s>
Oh , I will— I thought you might , to any of our panelists . </s>
Lloyd , you know that I find much about your… Do we all get a question ? </s>
Yes . </s>
Okay . You’ll get— I know you’re chomping at the bit— Frank , you get two questions . </s>
I have to get out the boxing gloves for you guys . That’s fine . Okay , go ahead . Let me raise this of Lloyd , because , Lloyd , other than , perhaps sensing a kind of market fundamentalism here , I can not for the life of me see how you think the system you propose would work . If donors , now…people who are potential donors are not willing to sign a donor card because they don’t trust the system , they worry that they’ll be declared dead prematurely , or have their deaths hastened , why would anyone be willing to sign a contract for a delivery of organs after his or her death , for money , when that would seem to me to be the least trustworthy system . </s>
All right— So if you can answer that— </s>
—brief—brief— —I’d be grateful— </s>
—brief question , brief answer— Okay— </s>
—from Lloyd . If James… he asserts , people are not willing to sign now , because they’re , they don’t trust the system and they’re afraid of being declared prematurely dead . Where does he get his information from ? </s>
From idiot surveys . </s>
No good social scientist relies on such evidence . </s>
You—no economist ever wants to make use of a survey . People say anything in a survey . Surveys are not a test of anything . Use a little bit of introspection as to why it is you may or may not sign an organ donor card . People in general don’t want to contemplate their own violent , immediate , surprising death and dismemberment . </s>
Okay . Great surprise ! Okay . In my conclusion I’ll explain why it is that the market will work , but I— All right , okay— </s>
Ira’s not gon na give me any more time— I got it— Even though I deserve more than anyone else . Just ‘cause you look like Mel Brooks doesn’t mean you get the extra time , so— So hang in there , Amy , it’s your turn to— Okay , before I get to my question I do wan na respond to what James said about the system— </s>
No , no , we’re— No , no , no , he—he specifically , responded— This is gon na be your question then . Mmm , well , I agree with him , that the system should be given every opportunity , we just can’t wait for all the people to die , right now , so we all want the system to work , we all want all of these efforts , we just can’t wait . </s>
Now the question . And this is for James . If you object to paying live donors because the poor would allegedly be coerced by poverty into making an unwise choice , do you have any objections to the middle class selling a kidney . It would not be difficult to restrict organ sales to those whose income is at least 70 percent of the American median . </s>
Sure , that would make kidneys more expensive , we could live with that . How about you ? Does taking the desperately poor out of the picture make you relent , or do you now move to the paternalistic position that no one should accept any amount of money . The issue has to do in part with relative deprivation , disadvantage , I used several different terms in the discussion , disadvantage being one of them , that’s often relative rather than absolute in regard to say , poverty level . </s>
I think that the way you’re raising the question here , I focus on obviously the extreme version of it , those in desperate straits— The problem we think we—I think we would have is one that my colleagues also raised and that is , once you set up a system , you’re not going to be able to restrict it to the kind of level you indicated , … set it in terms of income level . Because you’re going to be then charged with discrimination against the poor and their opportunity to obtain it , that—the system would be unstable , the way you’ve sketched it . </s>
So your objection is practical , not ethical or moral ? No , I’ve given an ethical one but I’m just saying in response to your question , that that would be the problem with the system you’ve proposed . Okay . </s>
Next question , Frank , you can— So this is for Amy . </s>
And I do so asking her in the reality of , now the market exists . The market that Dr. Friedman wants to have , now exists . She’s a transplant surgeon , she’s got a 72-year-old patient in front of her , and by her market system , there’s a 56- year-old middle class , who’s before her as well . </s>
The 56-year-old has come forward , and is prepared to sell his or her kidney , his kidney , and now I’d like to know from Dr. Friedman the following . Would you advise your 72-year-old patient to accept a 56- or 60- year-old , when the insurance company of this patient is saying , we can get you to India tomorrow , and we can have a twen— We can get you to Manila tomorrow , and we can have a 20-year- old kidney for you . If the alternative is that the patient could go out of country for a 20-year-old , versus your market system that will only provide the 56- or 60-year-old , what would you advise . Your patient . Dr. Friedman ? </s>
The construct of the system has to be along the lines of what we have with Medicare now and that is that , patients who currently go out of this country to have transplants at non-Medicare- approved transplant centers don’t have their medications paid for subsequently . That’s not true . </s>
That 's prohibited . But it’s not true . What is— </s>
…end of discussion , that 's not true . You can come back and have your medications still , if you 're Medicare eligible , you’ll have your medications paid— Frank , we’re now required to inform every patient— </s>
Well , let’s go back , let’s go back to— Wait , you asked her a question , let , let— Frank , we are now required to inform every patient that if they don’t have their transplant performed at a Medicare-approved center , Medicare wo n't pay for their medications . That’s the type of system that we ought to proceed with , the same kind of— </s>
Is this patient going out of country , is the patient going out of country or not ? </s>
They should n't be permitted to , because they wo n't have access to medications and other care . Okay , Lloyd , you get a chance to ask a question . Okay , my , mine is a question for Frank . Now , unlike the other participants in this debate , I 'm not a good and generous person . It’s true , ask my daughter , she’s there . </s>
I am so callous and uncaring that I wrote a codicil to my will disinheriting any member of my family who consents to the donation of any of my organs , unless they are paid at least eight hundred and sixty-four dollars and thirty-seven cents per organ . I posted this on my web page , and other people have downloaded it and amended their wills accordingly . </s>
Now , I ask you , Dr. Pangloss , I 'm sorry , I mean Dr. Delmonico… Is your objection to my estate profiting from the salvaging of my organs so strong that you think it just and right to threaten innocent sick people with prison for purchasing my organ ? Is there some great ethical principle that I do not understand under which the sick should be condemned to die rather than obtain organs from the self-interested and even selfish ? Well , the problem is n't that they would have to buy your organs , it’s that they would go elsewhere . They wo n't want your organs , Lloyd . </s>
They 're going to go to Manila for the twenty year old . Thank you . I don’t think that was an answer , Frank . </s>
Well , yes it is an answer . The answer is that they 're going to be in a position when you have legalized markets to say , who wants your organs in your circumstance when I can go to Manila to buy one from a twenty year old ? </s>
Well— That’s the answer . Sally wants , I 'm going to break the rules a little , Sally wants to jump in . She’s the only one who’s ever bought an organ here— </s>
Or thought about it . Or thought about it , so— I did think about it . …let’s get some practical— Frank , I don’t understand . </s>
We can do that now . </s>
I can go to Manila now , so I do n't see why having a mechanism where organs can be compensated for by a third party makes any difference at all . The point is , Sally , that I’d like you to see what it looks like to go to Manila— Well , the reason I would have to go to Manila— </s>
And now , and the point is— …is because I could n't buy it here— …if you say , in the United States , it’s legal to have a market in the US , then you 're going to set up a global competition for buyers . </s>
And the rich people will , why should we stay here ? </s>
Why should the insurance companies— </s>
Frank ! We can do that now . </s>
And the point is , you’ll— And people will stay here if they can get it now . Okay , we can ping pong on this back and forth . David , you have one last shot at asking a question . The question I have for Amy or Sally , they can choose— </s>
Come on , you’ve got to pick one . Oh really ? Yeah . Well let me— She can refer it to the other one . </s>
Let me pick Sally , because if I recall correctly , some of your affiliation is with a group that does n't like all kinds of regulations that some of us do like . Your think tank is not known for its pro- regulatory system . Given that stance in most areas , let me just rattle off a couple of quick points— This has got to be in form— Oh , it’s going to be quick— </s>
It’s like Jeopardy , it’s in form of a question . It is . </s>
Okay . Given what we know about Enron , given what we know about mortgage , works , given what we know , at least according to some , about the way hedge funds work , given these examples , what makes you confident that a regulatory system where everyone could enter the market could possibly work ? Everything we know about regulation suggests that this would be a disaster , and to move us to a regu- , to count on regulation as you do , as Amy did earlier , you 're out of your league . All right— </s>
Well , first— </s>
Amy or Sally , whatever , which… Thank you for bringing up AEI , because it’s actually a place where we have more intellectual freedom than most universities , which is why I can talk about a regulated system and don’t have to adhere to a classic free market form . Now , the kind of system I have in mind , really is a straw man I think you guys keep setting up , we are not talking about a classic commercial free for all , or a free market , or an eBay system . </s>
We’re talking about a third party payer . For example , today you , Ira , could decide to give a kidney . </s>
You’d be called a Good Samaritan donor , you would show up at New York Med , and you would say , please give my organ to the next person on the list in this region , in this hospital , in the country . </s>
And they would do it . The only difference in a model that we’re thinking , or I 'm thinking about , is where you go and give your organ , and your retirement account is wired forty thousand dollars , end of story . Everything else is the same , the , the screening you go through , the same medical check up , everything . </s>
Okay , we now have time for question and answers from the audience , and please make your way out to the microphone , or have the microphone meet you , or a meeting of minds some place in the middle of the aisle . Go ahead , you can stop there and ask , go ahead . </s>
My name is— </s>
Technology problem with the mic , is it working ? Thanks , my name is— We don’t hear you . </s>
Can you hear me ? </s>
All right , go ahead . </s>
Well , my name is John Fung , and I 'm pleased to say I had no meeting with people on the panel . By disclosure , I was a transplant surgeon at the University of Pittsburgh for twenty years , and now at the Cleveland Clinic . During my years at the Cleveland Clinic , at the University of Pittsburgh I was fortunate to have been involved in the care of Robert Casey , who was then the Governor of Pennsylvania , having been part of the team that had performed a combined heart and liver transplant on him . And shortly after his transplant he met the family of the donor . </s>
His mother , the donor’s mother , relayed to Governor Casey at the time that the funeral expenses for her son could n't , they could n't come up with the money for it . And as it turns out , to maybe , perhaps the audience does n't realize , is that , funeral directors charge an additional amount on top of the costs of the preparation for the body on the order of about three hundred dollars because of the donation process . And so Governor Casey at the time , along with some of the transplant procurement centers in the state , came up with Act 102 , which provided the opportunity for citizens of Pennsylvania to donate a dollar as part of their annual tax— </s>
Mr. Fung , I 'm going to have to ask you to get to your question— </s>
I 'm sorry— I have other people waiting . So the question , all right , and anyway , the three hundred dollars that was assigned to be allowed to pay for these funeral expenses was never implemented , even though it was approved by the state legislature , and the reason was because we did n't , it was thought to be against the federal regulations , the National Organ Transplant Act . One of the issues here is , we’re talking about pro and con , the fact is that we do n't have any data whatsoever that says it can be done , or ca n't be done in the United States . We’re all referring to the Middle East , or South America , whatever . </s>
So I think one of the comments for the pro side of this is , why not allow a pilot study ? Okay , let me get— The American Medical Association— Okay ! </s>
You made your point , thank you . </s>
Any comments ? Why not allow , why not allow a pilot study to see how… ? Well there , again , I really want to draw the audience’s attention to the fact that the Pennsylvania initiative that Dr. Fung was just alluding to did n't trouble a lot of folks . </s>
It was small , the amount of money was relatively trivial , although some wag in the New York Times wrote everybody who’s dying is going to go to Pennsylvania , which I thought was pretty absurd . </s>
Not heaven , huh ? Oh , I 'm sorry . I see , okay , I get it . </s>
Look , in New York , you know , first prize is one day , second prize is two days in Philadelphia , but that’s another story . We have to give them equal time now . This is true . But I ca n't emphasize enough that the excitement and the interest and the concern about this issue does n't come from the , you know , the couple of hundred bucks in the cadaver world— </s>
David , I have to get to the question , and that was , why not give it a try ? Well I really don’t have great problems with giving Pennsylvania a try , Frank and Jim may… But that’s not what we’re debating tonight . Okay , Frank , what -- would you be willing to give something a try , or anything that they , some , some form of it ? There’s a guy in Taiwan , Formosa Plastics , a generous man , every time somebody dies whose family donates a kidney , he gives them several hundred dollars for burial expenses . This crowd would n't be here if we were debating three hundred bucks for burial expenses . </s>
I know , but he’s not , that was a long story , well told , but got the point— Three hundred bucks for burial expenses . </s>
Let me ask Jim , what— First of all , I have no problem with that experiment , I wish it would have been implemented , it’s an expression of gratitude to the donors , that is very different from setting up an incentivized system— </s>
That’s right . …of the sort for living vendors , and they 're not donors , they are vendors if we’re paying them to donate . Why not do an experiment , because so much of what we have said today , on both sides , is actually a matter of speculation . </s>
We don’t know whether it would be , some of these proposals would be effective or not . </s>
We don’t know whether they’ll have bad consequences . I think the main reason we should not change the federal and several state laws in order to allow some of the kinds of experiments that have been proposed would be precisely that we would then cross the barrier that I think David has emphasized , that once you’ve made the organs into a commodity , you wo n't be able to turn back , and that— </s>
Okay . </s>
…the experiments , I think would be dangerous to do— Well , we got half… I have to make one , this is directly contrary to what the IOM report of two years ago , of which , were n't you— That’s the Institute of Medicine ? </s>
Institute of Medicine Report , which said no experiments , no trials , nothing in— </s>
The experiments— Well , you pay extra for the furniture , so just , just… All right , let’s go get another question here from the audience . My question is directly a follow up on the preceding question , and it’s directed at Dr. Friedman . Clearly if forty thousand people die every year waiting for these , waiting unsuccessfully for kidneys , and seventy-five thousand suffer on dialysis and lose their strength waiting for kidneys , then the current system is not working despite what James Childress says . It’s not working well enough . </s>
Now you pointed out before that there may be some long term consequences to donors , but the number that always appears in literature is that only point oh three percent of donors die as a result , in the long term or even in the short term , of donating a kidney . So , it sounds like a very safe thing to do . Why are n't the major advocacy organizations doing more pilot research to assess whether there are any long terms risks , and also doing research on what types of compensation systems would mitigate some of the objections raised by the other side ? I 'm amazed that the advocacy organizations have adopted such a do nothing position . </s>
And finally , let me just ask Dr. Delmonico , you’ve mentioned several times , and the other members of your panel , that the people on the other side are guilty of market fundamentalism , and I wondered whether perhaps on this side there was an overdose of equality fundamentalism , so that people in this country may be dying waiting because of concerns that in other parts of the world poor people are selling their organs . </s>
Okay , let’s , we’ll get , Amy , do you want to handle that ? Yeah , thank you for your comments on lag donor safety . It’s critically important . Nobody has done these long term studies because we don’t have a mechanism to capture and retain information about the donors twenty and thirty years out , and we don’t have the means of paying for it . </s>
Right now we can have a donor who has no medical insurance whatsoever come and donate a kidney because the recipients insurance pays for it , but we have no mechanism after they get through the early post- operative period to pay for their care . That’s expensive . </s>
And that 's a part of what would need to be in a regulated system . And thank you very much , all of the advocacy organizations , the American Society of Transplant Surgeons , the American Society of Transplantation , the government , and everybody at this table , on both sides , very much agrees that we need to capture the information about donors , we just ca n't afford to , and in the absence of universal health care or a single system , we ca n't do it because they just escape , we ca n't track them . Frank , did you want to respond ? </s>
Yes , I do . Four thousand people dying on the list , forty percent of the people who are dying are not in need of kidneys . </s>
They would not , the market system would not affect them by having more organs available , because you ca n't buy a heart , you ca n't , unless you 're in Egypt you ca n't buy a liver , you ca n't buy a lung . One of the problems of the proposal is that , and David brought this up , the assumption that those patients would still have a cadre of deceased organs available . But that experiment has been done in Hong Kong and in other places . When you have markets , there is no , the deceased donation is negatively impacted . So , right away , when you say four thousand people are dying on the list , not quite , but almost half are dying in need of organs that he market system will not impact . </s>
Now , next , on the kidney front , of those that are dying , we need to make an assessment of why they 're dying , and whether or not that is simply because they have not received an organ . Some of the patients that are dying on the list have been on that list for an extended period of time , inactive . And this was a point that we did n't get an opportunity to discuss . Inactive means that you do not receive an offer for a kidney . </s>
The market system will not impact an individual that is inactive on the list . Currently , thirty-three percent of the list , waiting for kidneys , twenty-four thousand patients are inactive on the list . That needs to be evaluated further before we go down the road of a market , we better assess the wait list of the premise to have markets . Okay , we’ve run out of time for this section of the audience participation , now we’re going to move to the final last lap here , the closing remarks . </s>
Each one of the debaters will get two minutes to sum up or rebut whatever they’d like to say , and I’ll give you a one minute warning , and we’ll start with Jim , you go first . Thanks . I have never said that our current system . </s>
You can go up there if you’d like to . </s>
Oh , that 's fine , I’ll sit here , I’ll be fine . I’ve never said that our current system is working well enough . </s>
I think we have a good system , not yet a great system , and I think we need to do a lot more to improve it , and I think we can do so . And I would just note in response to Amy’s comment , that we simply ca n't afford to develop a mechanism to follow up on living donors . If we ca n't afford to do that , then we can not afford to do what we need to do to make a market in living vendors and sellers for kidneys work . </s>
We can not , I would argue , destroy , we should not , I would argue , damage or destroy our system , which is not working as well as it should , and we need to improve , by adopting a flawed market in organs . Our opponents have proposed a radical change in our organ transplant system , and yet they’ve failed , in my judgement , to satisfy the burden of proof required for a drastic alteration of a system that is working fairly well and that can be further improved . By contrast , we’ve , I think , given good reasons for suspicion of such a market , and I hope that you will vote no for legalizing , that is , against legalizing a market in organs . </s>
All right , you have a minute left . I 'm done . Okay , thank you for— </s>
Can I take his minute ? You 're , well , I 'm going to go to Sally next . Can he yield his time to— Sally , you have two minutes . </s>
Okay . Sally Satel . Thanks . </s>
Well , during the time we’ve been here tonight , yes , someone has died , and this was a real person with a real family who would have lived if there were enough organs . </s>
It may sound maudlin , but it’s very true . And this is why we need to compensate donors . Altruism , or whatever is in that area between being paid and giving an organ is not enough . And insisting that it remain the basis for transplant policy is a reckless and derelict stance that will only guarantee a future of suffering , and not just for the patients , but for , who will languish and die on dialysis , but for black market donors as well . </s>
Our opponents hate the black market , well so do we . But somehow we learned something they never did , that the only way to stop elicit transactions is to sanction legal ones . Simply clamping down on elicit sales only drives it further underground , or causes it to blossom somewhere else , and the only way out of this tragic bind is to increase the supply . </s>
And the only way to do that is through a fair , transparent , safe , and legal means of exchange . Until then , the fate of third world donors and the patients who need their organs to live will remain tragically entwined . And until then , our opponents , who refuse to allow even experimentation with compensation , will be complicit , yes complicit , in fostering the organ trade . We welcome the other side to work with us , but as you’ve seen , they’ve never met a proposal they did n't reject or attack , they have a dearth of creative ideas , but an abundance of passion for obstructing innovation . In closing , unless we establish a legal market for kidneys in some form , we should brace ourselves for more needless suffering and death . </s>
Our side refuses to stand for that . So should you . It’s too high a price for a humane society to bear . </s>
Thank you . Now speaking against , Francis Delmonico . When Sally says someone has died in just , you know , in the past moments , what you have to understand is that someone has died , and a market system would n't have impacted that death . If you 're dying in need of a heart , you ca n't buy a heart . </s>
So , someone has died , and we do need more deceased organs , there’s no question about that , but the premise of a market system , by death on the list , is not resolved by a market system . </s>
Next , a dearth of creative ideas ? Sally and I have met on a number of occasions to talk about what we can do differently to provide care for live donors that does not exist in this country , but is not a cash payment . </s>
Sally and Amy are contradictory . When Amy says you ca n't go out of the country , and Sally says , well , you can go right now out of the country . </s>
I could have gone . Exactly . She could have gone , and they do go . And it’s not just that they 're going from the United States , but they 're going from Canada , and Saudi Arabia , and Israel , and the Gulf Countries , and from Europe . And where are they going ? </s>
And why would n't they go ? And the question that was posed to Amy , the seventy- two year old patient that she has , and Ira , excuse me , Ira comes along and he , in the system that they—Ira’s going to be the donor . </s>
Wonderful . But why should that seventy-two year old or a fifty year old accept Ira when they can go to Manila , if it’s legalized ? </s>
Right ? Sorry , Ira . </s>
It’s okay . Why should they accept— It’s an old kidney , so— Why should they accept Ira when they can go for a twenty year old and purchase that , because the United States says it’s okay to buy your kidneys . </s>
Let’s have an outlet store in the poor countries of the world to go and buy kidneys . That’s the problem that’s created by the United States saying it’s okay to have a market . Thank you . </s>
Moving on to the for side , Amy Friedman . Our opponents have told you that payment has been tried and is unsafe . Been there , done that . </s>
We tell you we know the way it’s being done now is wrong , let’s regulate it and do it right . We have no intention of stopping efforts to increase the number of deceased donor organs . This does not , in any way , affect those efforts . </s>
We ca n't afford independently , as transplant centers , or independent societies of transplant surgeons for example , to follow these live donors . We don’t have those funds . The government could provide the funds to long term provide the safety net and understand what’s happening with live donors . </s>
What we propose is the only solution to closing the dangerous black market . </s>
They’ve implied the dignity of the donor would be assaulted . We’ve told you there’s no dignity for people dying . We propose an approach that preserves the rights of donors , and compensates them for the risks they do assume . One minute . We’ll allow them to join us , the club of people who benefit from their life-saving gift . </s>
Is n't that treating them in a most dignified manner ? This is supposedly an academic debate , and David even called it an exercise , but the ninety-nine thousand people currently waiting for organs , who are there for so long that they become inactive because they 're too sick to get the transplant then , need real solutions , and they need you and us to be willing to think out of the box . </s>
There are lots of clever people available in this country to devise a system that can do it right , let’s do so . Thank you , on the against side , David Rothman . Your two minutes . Well , some quick principles . First , beware of doctors who play regulators and economists . </s>
What you’ve heard from the physicians is fantasy . I 'm not sure lawyers are much better at it , having heard Lloyd , but you 're in a Never-Never Land , truly in a Never-Never Land . We’re going to not have immigrants do it . </s>
Why not have immigrants do it ? Helter-skelter . Sally came out with a formulation which those of us in New York are a little scared about . The only way to stamp out illicit behavior is to legalize it . I can think of commercial sex work , but I don’t want to go there . </s>
Second , don’t think that you 're doing the poor a favor . You want to do the poor a favor , start thinking in terms of economic development , watch what China did , watch what India is in the process of doing . Massive infusions of capital , growth , real change . This kind of pittance of giving the poor a little money— One minute . </s>
…here so that they can , you know , sell their body part , that’s absurd . You want to do something for the poor , do it in a real way , spur economic development . Finally , you 're not doing the middle class any favor here either . I made that point with college , there’s got to be a better way to pay for an expensive wedding . Don’t go down that route . </s>
Speaking for , final words , Lloyd Cohen . So much pernicious , pretentious foolishness to refute , so little time . Are you shocked and surprised that anyone would argue that paying for organs will not increase the supply ? I was at first , and then it became clear . The prospect of an effective organ market places our opponents behind the eight ball . </s>
A market that would recover vital organs now being fed to worms would be the salvation of thousands of patients . As against the saving of innocent lives , poetic statements about the dignity of human life being degraded by commercialism would be revealed as empty moral pieties . </s>
Our opponents would therefore prefer to believe that a market would not work , and demand that we must prove that it will . </s>
The obvious way to demonstrate the efficacy of a market is to permit one , but of course the law forbids that . </s>
So what other evidence or theory can I offer ? First , consider the thriving organ markets in living donors in places like India . A market in the US where the interest of donors would be safeguarded by American law would , of course , be much more successful . And there’s no reason to think that somehow the American market would be like the Indian market , in the same way there’s no reason to think , if any of you have been to India , that potable water from the tap was as common in India as it is in the United States . </s>
One minute . And… No ! And what does the success of living donor markets say about a market in cadaver organs ? The sacrifice is incomparably greater for the living donor than for the deceased , so the supply of deceased donors will be far more responsive to a positive price . Second , look to the very reason that our opponents have such faith in the efficacy of altruism , and at the same time restrict its required application to organs rather than extend it to surgical services , nursing , and hospital care . They believe that altruism should work for transplant organs , because they are of no value to the dead , and of enormous value to the ill . </s>
Whatever this vast disparity should say about the power of altruism , it speaks volumes in the world of markets . Everywhere we look markets move goods from low valued uses to high valued ones . Third— Lloyd , I got— Ah ! I’ve got seventeen more reasons , but you’ll have to talk to me privately . </s>
There you go . Thank you all . </s>
Time to pull out your little magic clicker and decide , we talk , you decide , so to speak , who’s going to carry the day Pick up your key pad , I’ll tell you how to , once again you can see the motion is , “We should legalize the market for human organs.” If you are for the motion , press one . If you are against the motion , press two . And if you 're still undecided , press three . So , cast your votes , and we’ll give you a little bit of time to do that . </s>
And while you 're doing that I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of our debaters up front here . Lloyd Cohen , professor of law at George Mason University . Amy Friedman , director of transplantation , professor of surgery at SUNY Upstate Medical University . Sally Satel is a psychiatrist and resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institution for Public Policy Research . On my left is James Childress , professor of ethics at the University of Virginia , and director of the Institute for Practical Ethics in Public Life . </s>
Francis Delmonico , professor of surgery at Harvard Medical School , and director of medical affairs for the Transplantation Society . </s>
And finally , David Rothman , professor of social medicine , and director of the Center on Medicine as a Profession at Columbia . This is the last debate of the second Intelligence Squared US series . This program has been a huge success because of the support of people like you out there in the audience , audience members like yourselves who have been very enthusiastic about hearing both sides of big issues , and great issues they are , arguments that are brought here in all the series debates that have been hosted . </s>
Intelligence Squared would also like to thank the Asia Society and Museum for being our venue , right here in this beautiful auditorium , thank you from the very beginning . And as many of you already knew , due to the overwhelming success , and the demand for tickets , they 're going to be moving out of this auditorium and into a bigger place . Intelligence Squared is going to resume in the fall at the larger Caspary Auditorium at Rockefeller University . You know that big building that looks like the geodesic dome there at the Caspary Auditorium ? That’s at 66th and York . </s>
And that first debate is going to be on Tuesday , September 16th . Oh , this is a good one , small little topic , the motion : “Government mandated universal health care means inferior health care.” That’s the motion that you can come and vote on , and a ticket package and individual tickets for the fall in 2008 and spring 2009 series will go on sale later this month . An email alert and a brochure is going to be coming out in the coming weeks , so you 're not going to be able to avoid that . You can check the website also for updates . </s>
You can also get an edited version of tonight’s Intelligence Squared debate , it can be heard locally on WNYC , AM820 , coming up on Sunday , that 's May 25th , at 8pm . These debates are also heard on more than a hundred and fifty NPR member stations , and of course , as they say , please check your local member station listings for the dates and times outside of New York City . Also , you can , of course , purchase a DVD from previous debates upstairs from the Intelligence Squared US website . </s>
And now here is the result of the final polling . Before the debate we had forty- four percent for the resolution , after the debate we have sixty percent . Thank you , thank you . Thank you . Against , against the debate , before we had twenty-seven percent , and it moved up just four points to thirty-one percent against . </s>
But it was the , of course , the undecideds who decided this , from twenty-nine percent to nine percent , a twenty point move . So we had sixty percent for , thirty-one percent against , nine percent undecided . Thank you all for coming tonight , we’ll see you on Friday , on Science Friday . Congratulations— We have these debates because of the generosity of the Rosenkranz Foundation which started them and continue to sustain them . </s>
And I want to welcome to the stage , to launch things , the chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Nearly 18 years ago , the Oslo Accords were reached , which provided for mutual recognition of Israel and the PLO . Ever since there have been outbreaks of violence and an intermittent “peace process” has been carried on with the hope of resolving the conflicts . Very little tangible progress has been made , while Israeli settlements have altered the facts on the ground is Israel’s favor . On the other hand , the facts on the ground , in terms of world public opinion have moved decisively against Israel , not only in the Middle East , but in Europe , and perhaps in the U.S. , as well . </s>
Against this back drop , the Palestinian authority is asking the UN for admission as a member state . A bit of background about the UN is helpful . The UN Security council includes five permanent members , the US , China , Russia , France , and the UK . Any one of these can veto the admission of Palestine . In contrast , the General Assembly , in which all members vote equally , can acknowledge Palestine’s status as a state , but only as a non member . </s>
Granting Palestine status as a member state would reinforce the UN’s long standing resolutions in favor of a two state solution , express its disapproval of Israel’s settlements policy and the difficulties it has imposed on the lives of Palestinians living in the west bank . It would lend moral authority to the Palestinian cause , and might induce Israel to take a more conciliatory posture in negotiations . The US could exercise its veto power in the Security Council but at a cost in terms of our relations with the Arab world . And even a vote by the General Assembly to grant Palestine status as a non member state might give the Palestinians access to the International Criminal Court , where they could legally challenge the Israel occupation . </s>
On the other hand , nothing the UN can do will alter the facts on the ground . Nothing will resolve the dysfunctional , fragmented , conflict ridden , often corrupt , character of Palestinian attempts at self- government . </s>
Nothing will get the Palestinians to develop a coherent negotiating position , or to provide realistic assurances that agreements once reached would be enforced . Prior UN resolutions have endorsed the goal of Palestinian sovereignty . </s>
A UN admission of Palestine would be a redundant expression of hope , rather than a meaningful step toward peace . Debates about Israel and the Middle East are always heated . Tonight’s debate should generate light as well . </s>
We have an outstanding group of experts to illuminate these vexing issues , and it’s my pleasure to turn the evening over to our moderator , John Donvan . </s>
Thank you , Robert . </s>
Thank you . Thank you . And may I just invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible . </s>
Yes or no to this statement : The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . It is a statement that divides us , but it 's one that is worthy of fair and open debate . And that 's what this is , another debate from Intelligence Squared US . I 'm John Donvan . </s>
Welcome . We have two teams , four superbly qualified debaters , all of whom have lived at the heart of this argument . </s>
And it 's an argument that , let 's face it , in our lifetime , has seemed to be rather permanent , the way that the Berlin wall once seemed permanent , but turned out not to be , or apartheid in South Africa seemed permanent , but turned out not to be . But Israel and Palestine , this is the one that seems never to end . And why is that ? Well , nothing helps expose the fault lines like a good debate . And debaters who are trying to make you understand their point of view and maybe get you to see something in a way that you have never seen it before . </s>
We go in three rounds of debate . Then the audience votes on the winning debate . Only one side wins . </s>
Our motion is `` the UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' And to meet our debaters , Mustafa Barghouthi , you are a Palestinian , a former presidential candidate in the Palestinian authority . You are a Nobel Peace Prize nominee because you lead a party that is adamantly devoted to peaceful resistance to the Israeli occupation . And just very briefly , before we get started , what do you think is the point in this debate that your opponents do n't understand yet , that you want to make them understand ? </s>
I think the point is that admitting Palestine to the UN as a full member is in the best interest not only of the Palestinian people , but also of Israeli people . Thank you . And that it is in the best interest of peace with everybody . Thank you , Mustafa . </s>
Your teammate , who is also arguing for admission , Daniel Levy . </s>
It 's going to surprise some people that Daniel Levy arguing on this side is actually a citizen of the state of Israel . </s>
You were also a negotiator on the Israeli side in negotiations with Palestinians . And Daniel , from your point of view again , knowing that many of your fellow Israelis would oppose admission , what do you want the doubters to hear tonight ? Well , doubt is okay . </s>
Skepticism is healthy . But we ca n't pretend the Palestinians away . And time is n't healing this . </s>
So not acting to facilitate the Palestinian state is just a dereliction of responsibility to ourselves and to future generations . And because I just mispronounced your name , I 'm going to repeat the first sentence I said . Your team , and also arguing for the motion , Daniel Levy . I will be consistent with that from this point on . </s>
Our motion is this : `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' And arguing against the motion , Dore Gold , you are at the United Nations as Israel 's representative . You are an advisor to Prime Minister Netanyahu . You have been around the block on this one for years and years and years . And my question to you is what do you think the audience needs to hear tonight that they 've never considered before ? </s>
I 'm sorry . I have to correct you . I 'm currently not an advisor . </s>
I 'm a private citizen . But nonetheless , I 'll answer your question . Does he listen to what you say ? </s>
Have to ask him . Look , the position I am taking has nothing to do with recognition of the Palestinians . It has nothing to do with national dignity , which every people is entitled to . It has everything to do with undertaking an act which will create chaos , precisely at a time when the Middle East is more dangerous than ever . Thank you very much . </s>
And your partner is Aaron David Miller . Aaron , you are a former U.S. Middle East negotiator , a public policy scholar at the Woodrow Wilson international center for scholars . And you also have been involved in this at the negotiating table as an American and as the American at the table for 20 years . </s>
And what do you want your audience to key in on tonight ? </s>
John , thanks -- thanks for having all of us . No more illusions is my trope . Americans and Israelis have had their fair share . And now the Palestinians have theirs . </s>
UN admission in the absence of an agreement between Israelis and Palestinians will not take the Palestinians any closer to the full sovereign state that they deserve . </s>
Thank you , Aaron David Miller . So we 've heard from all of our debaters . We 've met them all . </s>
And shortly , we 're going to move on to round one . But first we want to ask you to go to the key pads at your seat and take a look again at our motion : `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' If you agree with this motion at this point , push number one , if you disagree , please push number two , and if you are undecided , push number three . And if you 've made an error , just correct your vote , and the last vote will be registered . </s>
These will be tabulated . We 're going to hold this result till the end of the debate . We 'll have a second vote . We 'll ask you in that second vote to judge which team presented the better arguments . </s>
And the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner . So onto round one , opening statements from each debater in turn . They will be seven minutes each . Our motion is , `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' Up for the motion first , `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state , '' former Israeli government negotiator , senior fellow at the New America Foundation where he is co-director of the Middle East task force , Daniel Levy . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , on October 10 , 1971 , the United Nations admitted the People 's Republic of China as a member and kicked out Taiwan . If that were the kind of motion we were debating tonight , I would not be standing here arguing in favor . What we are proposing is to admit Palestine at the U.N. not instead of Israel but alongside Israel , unfinished U.N. business from the middle of the last century . </s>
Let me first clear up what I hope will not become debris in the way of constructive debate tonight . We have not convened here to discuss matters of legal principle , `` Does Palestine meet the criteria of Montevideo for statehood ? '' </s>
Law matters , but this is primarily a political , not a legal question . </s>
And it 's not about the United Nations and whether it is a force for good or a frustrating institution . It can be both , and Israel of course went to the U.N. to get its own birth certificate endorsed . But the assumption of this debate is the two-state paradigm . </s>
We do not have anyone here advocating a greater Jewish Israel or a binational democratic state , nevertheless , it would be hubris to take two states for granted , and we need to recognize certain realities . The territorial viability of a second state in this area looks increasingly precarious . Approximately 600,000 Israelis , one in 10 Israeli Jews live beyond the green line . </s>
Settlements grow . Outposts are legalized . I invite you to go and see the reality . And it 's not just a physical manifestation of blurring . </s>
It is also the conceptual universe in which a growing number of Israelis live . Prime Minister Netanyahu may have talked the talk on two states , but he has not walked the walk . His own Likud party platform opposes two states , and one must take seriously the Jewish-Israeli narrative that says 100 years ago we had nothing , then we got Balfour , then we got the '47 partition , then we got 78 percent of the land , then in 1967 we got 100 percent of the land , and we 're not going anywhere . That 's a serious view , and it has an amen corner , by the way , certain people perhaps in New Hampshire tonight 's part of that amen corner . Passivity can not be the response . </s>
If we want two states , we have to act . And U.N. admission for Palestine is precisely the anchor for a two-state future , a clarifying moment . We need to be deeply respectful of the choices that Israelis are going to have to make , difficult choices , and the conversations in Israel , and , therefore , to understand just how unproductive the lack of clarity is for that Israeli conversation . Indulging bad behavior , treating that with impunity , is unhelpful in any human predicament . </s>
And we encourage the most self destructive tendencies in Israeli behavior when we pretend that by doing nothing , allowing this slippage away from two states , somehow we 're making it easier for Israeli society to change course . We are not . </s>
The cost benefit calculation of Israelis needs to look different . Do we really think that Israel is waiting to leave the territory , it 's just waiting , and the Palestinians just need to ask politely enough and behave well enough , and that 's the key to unlock this ? </s>
Let 's acknowledge that it 's not going to be easy but the current policies are n't helping . What , then , can be done ? The Palestinians do actually have options , violence . I 'm against that . </s>
That 's illegitimate . </s>
They can use nonviolence , coercive diplomacy of sanctioning . I can see its legitimacy , but I 'm not an advocate of that . Or they can use declarative diplomacy , draw a line , lay down a marker to get the attention of Israelis . That 's what U.N. membership is , and I would argue it correlates with what is best , therefore , for Israel . We ca n't expect the Palestinians to wait forever , and we ca n't say to them that you can neither have self-determination and express it at the U.N. but nor can you accept the one-state reality and argue for equal rights in one state . </s>
Suggesting the Palestinians can do neither is unrealistic , but it 's also immoral . So if we want to salvage a two-state solution but at the same time if we ca n't impose a solution and if we ca n't even prevent deterioration , if we ca n't even get a settlement freeze , then how do we give oxygen to this gasping for breath two-state idea ? We vote to admit Palestine to the U.N. and we vote for this motion tonight . U.N. membership is not a silver bullet . It’s not a panacea . </s>
It’s not sprinkling pixie dust on the harsh realities of the Middle East . But it is an important and legitimate part of a strategy to signal a different future . We will no doubt be told that this can’t happen , that it’s meaningless symbolism , and especially not now with the Arab spring . Wrong . </s>
Yes , the U.S. has committed to a veto . No doubt , we’ll discuss that . </s>
But does that make this debate pointless ? Can the realpolitik argument really close down our entire conversation ? If that’s the case , I strongly suggest you guys cancel the debate you have planned in March about banning college football , because it won’t be . And that can always be an argument . I urge the other side of this debate to give us more than naysaying , to give us more than negotiations . </s>
Those negotiations are asymmetrical . One side is so lacking in leverage and they are so steeped in years of failure . Negotiations can not be the singular tool in our toolkit . And finally , if we are concerned about Israel’s security , then let’s acknowledge that hope too is a security currently . Hopelessness encourages violence . </s>
There will always be the next mountain range that you need to occupy , but strategic security is about a basket of interests and balances and avoiding casus belli . And perhaps , perhaps , occupation itself contributes to insecurity and Israeli democracy . Eventually managing an occupation and justifying it and sustaining democracy can not happily coexist . Not to dramatize , but if we don’t have a Palestine , we are saying Kaddish . We are saying the right of prayer , of last prayer for Israeli democracy . </s>
I urge you to support this motion , to support the principle of Palestine alongside Israel at the U.N . Thank you . Thank you , Daniel Levy . Thank you , Daniel Levy . </s>
Our motion is “The U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state.” And here to speak against the motions , Aaron David Miller . </s>
For over two decades , he advised six secretaries of State , shaping U.S. policy on the Middle East in the Arab-Israeli peace process . He is a public fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Center . John , thank you very much . And thank all of you for coming . </s>
Daniel , I’ve known you for many years . I admire your passion and your intellect . You’re a powerful advocate of Israeli-Palestinian peace , of logic and common sense . All of this , however , does not address the fundamental problem , the conundrum now , Daniel . We’re dealing with a conundrum . </s>
We are stuck . Violence will never produce sovereignty for Palestinians , but neither will negotiations right now . So the question is what to do . What you are suggesting , in my judgment , is that we take an action that is not simply neutral , that will retard and undermine the very concept as dubious as you may believe it is . And Mustafa will agree . </s>
Dore may even agree . It is simply no justification for proceeding in the face of common sense logic toward an alternative that ultimately will not bring Palestinians closer to meaningful sovereignty . I speak here not as an Israeli to you and not as a Palestinian . I speak with all its imperfections and contradictions as an American , absorbed in this process for many years , 25 years . </s>
And during the course of that period , I developed a faith in three primary assumptions : Number one , there was a solution , equitable and durable ; number two , negotiations were the only way to achieve it . And negotiations is flawed and it’s imperfect because it’s based on human frailty and weakness and on the need and the capacity to compromise ; and finally , that the United States had a critical role to play in this process by being fair , by being tough and by being reassuring -- all of these assumptions . Any honest man or woman would acknowledge . </s>
And the situation , you’re quite correct , Dan , it will be worse . It will get worse before it gets worse . But the question still has to be addressed . How will granting the putative state of Palestine admission as a full-member state into the U.N. address any of this ? </s>
Now , I’m here to argue in six basic points . I don’t want to bore you . I’m not here to entertain you , but to leave you with perhaps a baker’s dozen in the next four-and-a-half minutes of why I believe this is a bad idea . And , by the way , I concede , particularly to you , Daniel , that I know bad ideas when I see them . </s>
I know illusions when I see them . I was responsible , over the course of a 20-year period , for quite a few , as Mustafa will attest , perhaps even Dore . But not tonight . </s>
I have no illusions tonight . First , as an American whose country sits on the Security Council , I can not , in all good conscience , recommend the admission of a putative state however morally or ethically compelling it may be as a full member state . </s>
Prime Minister Salam Fayyad , the man who has done more to build institutions of Palestinian statehood on the ground is against this proposition because he knows it 'll undermine the work that he has done . It 'll undermine the institutions . Palestine has no borders . </s>
It has no control over its population . It has no monopoly over the forces of violence within its own society . </s>
In short , it does not control the guns , all of the guns in its society . I would argue that 's critically important for statehood . Yes , much of this may be due to the Israeli occupation . </s>
But that does n't change the reality . Admission of Palestine now will create a situation in which it can not discharge its own obligations as a member state , in large part because half of its government , the rival Palestinian national movement does n't ascribe to a peaceful solution of interstate conflicts . Mustafa may have much to say about this , but this is an obligation of UN membership . </s>
Second , as an American , I 'd oppose this because I believe it 's not symbolic . It 's not symbolic at all . It 's a prescription , and an RX , if you will , for instability and perhaps even escalation . Think about it . </s>
We are admitting the Palestinian authority that presumes to control Palestine into the UN when in fact two other entities , one , the state of Israel , an ally of the United States , and the second factor and force , Hamas , an entity which is an adversary of the United States , has more control over what transpires in Palestine , this putative state than the Palestinian authority . That is a prescription for endless contradictions and perhaps even violence . Mustafa will tell you , and he may be right , that the basis for this negotiation , and the basis of -- for any Palestinian state will be June 4 , '67 borders . But admitting Palestine into the UN will mean that a Palestinian president not only has the right and the obligation to defend those borders . I would n't want -- I mean , maybe you see this as a blessing . </s>
I see it as a huge contradiction , to put any head of a putative state in a position where he has to defend borders that he can not defend . And what is he to say to his public when the Israelis continue to do what they will do ? </s>
Which brings me to my third point . </s>
There will be an Israeli reaction . </s>
And who is going to control that reaction ? The United States ? The international community ? As Israel seeks perhaps to set its own boundaries , to basically say to the Palestinians , fine , you have now set your boundaries . June 4 , '67 , is the basis of a negotiation if we ever return to the table . </s>
But we 're going to set ours now as well . </s>
We will set our boundaries . And we will be dragged sooner rather than later away from the prospect of any kind of solution . For , if the Palestinians want to pick a fight with the Americans , that 's their business . But I would argue it 's counterproductive . </s>
You 're going to have an election in November . And I 'm not talking as a Republican or as a Democrat . But anybody looking at this situation might argue that if you truly had a strategic interest in promoting Palestinian statehood , you probably would want to see the re-election of the current president . You would probably want to see the re-election of the current president , which would mean essentially that you 're not going to force him into a position to take action that will weaken the prospects of his own election . Finally , I 'll come back to my initial point . </s>
Just because we 're stuck does not mean the pursuit of a strategy that 's going to take us farther away than ever from our goal . Admission of Palestine now without an agreement will take Palestinians farther away from sovereignty . Thank you , Aaron David Miller . Your time is up . </s>
Thank you . A reminder of what 's going on . We are halfway through the opening statements in this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan . We have four debaters , two teams of two fighting it out over this motion : `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' </s>
You have heard the first two opening statements , and now onto the third . To debate in support of this motion that the UN should admit Palestine as a full member state , Palestinian democracy activist , secretary general of the Palestinian National Initiative and Nobel Peace Prize nominee , Mustafa Barghouthi . Thank you so much . And thank you for coming tonight , and thank you for inviting me to this debate . </s>
I have four reasons that I would like to emphasize why Palestine should be admitted to the UN . The first is that time is not an infinite commodity . And time -- we 're losing time . And with the continuation of Israeli settlements on the ground , which are illegal , and after 20 years of failed negotiations , we can not have the risk of losing the two-state solution . </s>
If Palestine is not accepted as a state very soon , there will be no two-state solution . And the outcome will be dangerous and bad for everybody . </s>
So we need the UN in this case to change the parameters , to change the course , the course of failure which Mr. Miller is defending . What Mr. Miller has suggested and what probably Mr. Gold will suggest is to continue the same path of failure , the same negotiation that 's failed to produce anything because of the imbalance . </s>
What -- and that , in my opinion , is irresponsible towards Palestinians and irresponsible towards Israelis as well . What they are proposing is to continue what Einstein described as insanity , which is doing the same thing over and over again and expect different results . Third , it also indicates , as I suspect Mr. Gold will show , such a position against UN admission indicates an underlying intention of rejecting the principle of having a Palestinian state , which means rejecting the right of the Palestinian people to be free . Continuing negotiations while settlements continue to grow is like having two sides negotiating over a piece of cheese . One side , the Palestinian side , is stuck behind bars . </s>
The Israeli side having access to the piece of cheese and eating it while negotiating . At the end of the day , we 'll find nothing to negotiate about . And that is not a solution . So my second point is that in the light of the failure of the disability and inability of the United States for internal reasons that are well-known to you , and in the light of the weakness of the Europeans and their participation , and in the light of the stubbornness of the Israeli extreme right wing , we have to find a way for a new strategy . We have one of three options . </s>
Either Palestinians would surrender to injustice , and that 's what some people are calling for . In this case , what you will witness is the consolidation of a system of apartheid , where Palestinians are discriminated against . </s>
And Israel would become the worst apartheid system in the 21st century , something that nobody could be proud about . Or the second option is violence , which we reject , and we do n't want . The third option is to have nonviolence , peaceful resistance , exactly like Gandhi did in India , and like Martin Luther King did here in the United States . And that 's the course we are taking . </s>
And that 's why going to the UN is nothing but another act of diplomatic resistance within the context of popular nonviolent resistance to change parameters and to change the balance of power so that we can have productive negotiations really and have a result at the end of the road . My third point is that , supposing our right to be admitted to the United Nations will be sending the right message , the message of respect to human rights , the message of respect to people 's right for self-determination , the message of respect of the right of people to be sovereign . If we speak about the right of people in South Sudan and in Kosovo and in Libya and in Syria to be free and to have self-determination , then why not Palestine ? </s>
And why continue to use the double standard , especially that admitting Palestine in the UN would be about correcting a historical mistake that was made . </s>
Since 1947 resolution the United States spoke about two states , Israel was established . Palestine was not . My last point is that we know that admitting Palestine to the United Nations would not immediately create a change on the ground . We understand , but it will achieve three goals . </s>
First , it will give us hope . </s>
It will give Palestinians hope . Hope is what we need today to sustain a nonviolent approach to our resistance and struggle . Desperation and lack of hope as is advocated on the other side will only bring violence and dangerous things . Second , accepting Palestine will actually invalidate all the de facto actions on the ground that are made by Israel and by creating settlements . And , third , it will send a message to the Israelis that they will not be really free unless Palestinians are also free . </s>
We are now victims of oppression and discrimination . The Israelis are hostage to occupation and fear , especially security fear . </s>
And Mr. Gold will try to show you that there is more fear today because of the Arab Spring . Instead of Israel being happy about people becoming democratic , they are having more fear . </s>
This is not the right approach . We want to liberate ourselves through popular nonviolent resistance through admission to the United Nations , but we also want to liberate the Israelis as well . Martin Luther King liberated the United States , not only the African-Americans , from segregation as well as Mandela liberated the whole of South Africa , the whites and the blacks together by liberating South Africa from apartheid . And that 's why what we want , what we are working for , is to liberate ourselves from oppression , the longest occupation in modern history , and the worst apartheid system , and to liberate the Israelis from fear , from the security phobia . </s>
One time a Palestinian leader came to the United Nations with a gun and an olive branch . </s>
Today we are coming to the United Nations with two olive branches . Do n't let us drop them . Thank you . Thank you , Mustafa Barghouthi . Our motion is `` The U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' </s>
Our final debater is going to speak against the motion . He 's Dore Gold , world renowned expert on Middle Eastern affairs . He 's former prime minister of Israel 's foreign policy advisor and former ambassador to the United Nations . Dore Gold . </s>
Those of you who are voting tonight should remember that we 're speaking about Palestinian membership at the U.N. , we 're not in New Hampshire . When I served as Israel 's ambassador to the United Nations back in the late 1990s , I had a colleague , a counterpart , who was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations , became a very close friend , it 's someone I intellectually admired . His name , unfortunately he 's passed away , was Richard Holbrooke . And one of the things I was struck by , before I was sent to the U.N . I was the Israeli negotiator . </s>
I was sent to the sand dunes of Gaza where Muhammad picked me up in that extended Mercedes and take me to Arafat 's house . We would discuss how to move forward in peace , and , by the way , those discussions were tough because he -- when you 're in a meeting like that , you do n't know where to park your head . Should you remember the Israelis who died in repeated suicide terrorist attacks that came out of territory under Arafat 's jurisdiction ? I know that 's tough to mention , but you 've got to know that . Do you think of those people ? </s>
Do you think about the moment ? Do you think about building a future ? Do you forget about the tragedies of the past so you 'll have hope ? How do you orient yourself ? </s>
It 's very , very tough . But I had that experience . We were involved in -- I spent hours with Mahmoud Abbas , Abu Mazen . </s>
I spent a tremendous time on the Hebron Agreement with Aaron and of course the Wye Agreement that followed afterwards . </s>
And what I had seen in the '90s is that we did n't succeed . We did n't succeed . We reached agreements . And , by the way , the man that some spokesmen like to try and put in the corner Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu signed two agreements with the Palestinians -- withdrew from territory , made sacrifices for peace , risked his whole political base because he wanted to move the process forward . </s>
It may not be the conventional wisdom in certain circles , but I experienced that . But let me go back to Holbrooke . So I saw that we had a tough time moving forward . And after I left government in 1999 and when Mr. Ehud Barak came into office . And Barak went to Camp David with Yasser Arafat . </s>
The peace wasn’t concluded . But I asked myself through my contacts with Holbrooke , “How was it ? ” </s>
And Richard Holbrooke delivered the greatest political diplomatic achievement of the Clinton administration , the Dayton Accords over Bosnia . Well , we didn’t succeed in the Middle East . </s>
We failed at Camp David . I’m not sure I still understand why that occurred . By the way , that is a tough conflict , the battle between Croats , Bosnian Muslims , the Serbs , was religious , ethnic , territorial . It had all the ingredients that we had . </s>
But they persisted . They persisted to negotiate . </s>
I discerned from my discussions with Holbrooke and from reading his memoirs on that conflict that there were three elements . He concluded that there must be a negotiated outcome . As much as you could be cynical about tough negotiations , that’s the only outcome that will work . The second thing that comes from my experience with talking to him and also in his memoirs is that peacemaking must come from the parties themselves . The great breakthroughs of Dayton came from those three warring parties . </s>
It’s true . They were brought to Ohio . </s>
It’s true . Secretary of State was in and out . President Clinton was ready to come in . But they themselves were responsible for reaching peace and imperfect peace . </s>
And finally , you need diplomatic flexibility . Let me tell you something . Both sides , certainly in our case -- I can speak to Israelis -- we have a deep inner conviction in the justice of our cause . But tonight’s not the night to lay that out to you . </s>
The point is that even though you have that deep inner conviction , the point is that even though you can go on every American network from CNN to FOX Television and lay that out to the American audience , you have got to make a compromise . </s>
You’ve got to cut a deal . You can’t walk away . And because they knew there had to be a negotiated outcome , because they knew it had to come from the parties themselves and the needed diplomatic flexibility , in the Balkans , they cut a deal , an imperfect deal . In fact , Holbrooke writes in his book the critical question : Will the Bosnians grasp an imperfect peace or let the war resumed remain unresolved right up until Dayton was convened ? </s>
Now , let me move to the issue at hand between us . What is my problem with the proposal that a Palestinian state be recognized as a U.N. member state ? As I said in my opening words , this isn’t about national dignity . You know , every people wants to recognized . And there are a lot of peoples out there beyond the discussion of who’s supposed to get independence -- Kurds , Tibetans , you name it -- every national movement wants to be recognized to the U.N . </s>
So my question isn’t about recognizing the rights of Palestinians . That was recognized by Menachem Begin back at Camp David in 1978 . </s>
My question is really twofold , and my concern is twofold . </s>
First of all , carefully listening to the speech of Mahmoud Abbas on September 23rd this year , or last year now , at the U.N. General Assembly , he wasn’t just saying , “Accept us in principle.” He was laying out borders . And I think Aaron made the reference to it , the June 4 , 1967 line , as though there was some kind of pre-’67 boundary , border , that was an international line that we have to agree to . That’s it . </s>
When we signed the Oslo Agreements , borders were supposed to be negotiated . And that -- to that point , to that very point , Yasser Arafat agreed . He signed those agreements . Or actually Abu Mazen signed the first agreement . </s>
The implement agreements , he later signed . So we 're talking about predetermining the final boundaries by moving to the UN . Dore Gold , I 'm sorry . Your time is up . It went by quickly , but you can bring some of that in later on . </s>
And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
And you can do one of those applause moments . Thank you . So our motion is : `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' </s>
Keep in mind how you voted at the beginning of the evening because we 're going to ask you to vote again at the end of the evening . And the team that has changed the most of your views on this motion will be declared our winner . So now onto round two . And this is where the debaters address one another directly and answer questions from you in the audience and from me . </s>
We have two teams of two . We have Mustafa Barghouthi and Daniel Levy who have been arguing that the UN should admit Palestine as a full member state for several reasons , including the fact that it introduces hope to the Palestinian people , and that hope militates against violence . Also , that in a peace process that is going nowhere , that is stuck , it lays down a marker that the Israelis can not ignore . The team arguing against the motion , they include Dore Gold and Aaron David Miller , are arguing against this motion on the grounds , number one , that what exists now in the territory controlled by the Palestinian Authority does n't really meet the qualifications of a state because it ca n't control its borders , it ca n't control its guns . And they 're also arguing that it is too soon to give up on negotiation itself . </s>
So we 're going to take questions from you . But first from me , I want to put a question to the side arguing against the motion . And I think , Dore , this may have been where you were heading . I want to understand why admission of the UN -- why admission of Palestine to the UN necessarily precludes the continuation of negotiations . Why ca n't there be this admission to the UN , and yet negotiations continue and ultimately a solution reached ? </s>
I mentioned that point already , which is , of course , that these are issues that have to be negotiated . You know , for example , one of the hard choices that Mahmoud Abbas has to face , one of the critical issues that he has to deal with is announcing , it 's the end of the conflict . By going to the UN , getting a Palestinian state , he does n't have to do that . He does n't have to come to terms with the question that we keep raising . We 're being asked , recognize the rights of the Palestinians to an independent state . </s>
So we 've done that . But we 're asking the Palestinians to recognize the right of the Jewish people to a nation state of their own . That has to be in the package . But in fact , there -- there -- But how are you recognizing the Palestinian state when you refuse to go back to '67 borders ? </s>
Because the borders have nothing to do with the existence of a state . The borders would be up in the air , or no borders ? </s>
No . We have to work out the borders . We have real problems . You know , everyone says , oh , just get out of the Gaza Strip unilaterally in 2005 . You wo n't have a full peace agreement because we did n't negotiate it unilaterally . </s>
And the situation will stabilize . Sorry . No one says that . </s>
That was the initiative of the Israeli prime minister . Daniel Levy . </s>
And he refused to -- No one was telling him unilaterally -- </s>
No one was telling us unilaterally . It does , but everyone said , if you end the occupation , the source of violence will end . Gaza is 6 percent of the land mass of the remaining 22 percent of mandatory Palestine that we 're talking about in a two-state solution . No one was saying , any occupation in six percent , maintain and entrench the occupation in 94 percent and see how that goes . Would n't you expect -- </s>
Dore Gold . Would n't you expect that if you get out of the given territory , that the level of violence from that territory would decline ? </s>
Maybe it would go up elsewhere . Dore , I -- let me -- wait . Wait a minute . Dore , let -- let -- wait a minute . </s>
Excuse me . </s>
Excuse me . Dore . I have a right of response . I do n't feel that you answered my question . Okay . </s>
Although , although you said that you had addressed it . My question is , you just talked about what 's left to be negotiated . Let 's take borders for example . Why not do this political gesture at the UN for the Palestinians ? Why would that preclude then having discussions on the borders afterwards ? </s>
In other -- you were saying this stops everything . </s>
And I 'm trying to understand why this would stop everything , and these negotiations could not continue on those points afterwards . Well , what if the very resolution itself states that the borders will be the June 4 lines ? Is the Palestinian side willing to relinquish that phraseology from a Security Council resolution ? Mustafa Barghouthi . Well , let me reiterate one thing . </s>
Let 's remember that in 1947 the -- Are you going to -- will you answer his question ? Simple question . Yeah , I 'm answering this question . </s>
In 19 -- he has -- he has been talking a lot , so let me . In 1947 , it was decided there would be two states . </s>
Israel would be on 54 percent of the land , Palestine on 44 percent of the land . Now we are accepting 22 percent . That 's less than half of what we should have had according to the UN in '47 . </s>
And Mr. Gold wants to take away parts of that land because for the settlements that keep growing , Israel is the only country in the world that has not told anybody what are its borders . Why ? But you 're not answering his question . Because -- His question was -- </s>
-- the resolution -- What about India or Pakistan ? Excuse me , Dore . Why do you -- Dore , excuse me . </s>
Excuse me . And why do you keep -- Dore , Dore , excuse me . -- assertion for this totally based -- </s>
Dore , excuse me . The question that he put , could there be a resolution that would not stipulate borders , that would leave that to be negotiated ? </s>
I think there are four issues for negotiation . There is settlements , there is the borders , there is the issue of refugees , there is the issue of Jerusalem . Nobody said that admitting us to the UN will mean that we will not negotiate about all these issues . </s>
Okay . That 's what we 're trying to come back to . And Dore , I 'm to understand why you say that ca n't happen . </s>
As one final point , please , it 's very dangerous to say we admit , we accept Palestinian , that they should have a state , but we do n't agree with '67 borders because what that means is that you want us to have a Bantustan like there was in South Africa . </s>
There were also Bantustans in South Africa with kings , not only presidents . But that did not mean that people were free . They were subjected to discrimination and apartheid system . </s>
Let me bring in Aaron David Miller . Look , we 're getting away from some very basic issues here . Admission to the UN recognition would conflate with acknowledgment of sovereignty . Legally , that may not be the case , but that is the way it would be read . </s>
That is the way the Palestinian Authority would interpret it . And presumably , that is the way the international community might interpret it as well . </s>
And that , the notion that recognition and admission would create the mindset , the June 4 , '67 borders have been established , have been laid down , would make it more difficult , even though , Mustafa and Daniel , it may well be the only rational , logical outcome is a negotiation with June 4 , '67 borders as a basis . </s>
Second , you have a divided Palestinian polity . And let 's not forget this point because it 's fundamental to the entire argument . You 're not dealing here with a negotiation which consists of one gun , one authority and one negotiating position . </s>
The notion that you would admit , as a member state , a divided Palestinian polity , half of which has not even signed up to the conditions that are essentially , by definition , basic to a negotiation -- Okay . Let me bring in Daniel -- you 've made two -- It 's critically important -- -- very strong , pragmatic arguments . </s>
Daniel Levy . It 's not -- it 's not -- one more point , John . John , John , another -- one last point . It 's not - - this notion of a division between what is morally acceptable , what is symbolic and what is pragmatic is a -- is a division without distinction . No one is doubting the fact that if the Palestinians were admitted into the UN , they would be more hopeful . </s>
No one is doubting that it would impress on the international community the notion of Palestine as a sovereign state . What I am doubting , and what you have yet to demonstrate , is that such an act would bring us any closer to -- Okay . </s>
-- meaningful sovereignty -- Daniel -- Aaron , I want to bring it to Daniel because I want to come back to some of the points -- Daniel Levy . </s>
Aaron , given that you 've told us that it has to get worse before it gets worse and that the Palestinians should join the reelect President Obama campaign , I 'm not sure -- and this is n't easy because it is probably obvious to everyone in this room . </s>
Me and Aaron are n't exactly hostile when it comes to one another . There 's deep mutual appreciation , and I greatly respect the service that Dore Gold has given to the state of Israel . I want to address the two points you put out there . First of all , what -- what we 've tried to make the point of is that if you want a two-state solution , you have to do something about it , and you have to begin to anchor it , and you have to send signals . No one is expecting , the morning after admission of Palestine to the UN , Palestine actually realizes its sovereignty . </s>
This is n't a standalone gesture . No , Aaron , I 'm going to -- I 'm -- I 'm not going to say a word . </s>
I 'm not going to say a word . </s>
Well , ultimately , you will . </s>
Yeah , exactly . As for the expectation that , if it 's admitted to the UN , well , that means it 's got full sovereignty . Listen , for 40 plus years , the Soviet Socialist Republic of Belarus , and of Ukraine , were members of the U.N. Did that mean that they were independent states in the USSR ? </s>
Come on , this is a political act . </s>
What we 're talking about here is sending a political signal from the U.N . Your second point , the divided Palestinian authority . </s>
First of all , Aaron , you did n't get it exactly right in your description of who takes -- who assumes that Palestinian seat at the U.N . It 's not the Palestinian authority , it 's the PLO , and that has been clarified and made clear . The PLO is still headed by Abbas . The PLO has certain commitments that it has made in signed treaties . And I would look at this as I try and look at most things , to be honest , as how do we use this opportunity ? How does this become an entry point to problem solving rather than rejecting it as another nonstop -- </s>
All right , let me come back to -- I want to finish the point . My entry point for this is a problem solver is I would turn around and say , `` Palestine , you 're in the U.N. , you sign the U.N. charter , read the words of the U.N. Charter . Hamas , you want reconciliation , you have to be signing up to the U.N. Charter as well . '' I would make this part of the encouragement of internal Palestinian unity , to see the opportunity , not a way to threat . </s>
Dore Gold . Daniel Levy mentions the U.N. Charter . </s>
And , you know , one of the most important points in this discussion to keep in mind is -- sorry to be legal -- but Article 4 of the Charter , which says , `` Membership in the United Nations is open to all other peace loving states which accept the obligation to continue the present charter , '' peace loving states . Why is that important ? </s>
Mustafa Barghouthi has invoked the names of Martin Luther King -- I do n't know if he said `` Gandhi , '' but -- I said `` Gandhi '' and `` Mandela . '' </s>
-- and Mandela -- -- men who were against violence . If only we had them . Exactly , if only -- I mean , Palestinian political culture had adopted those positions , but -- -- frankly , frankly , just now , on December 22 , in a meeting in Cairo , and I 'm not sure whether you were there or not -- I was . Yes , okay . </s>
I do n't want to get it personal , but there was a meeting of the Palestinian leadership and it included Khaled Meshal , the head of Hamas , it included the heads of Islamic jihad , and these are organizations that call for the obliteration of the State of Israel , the destruction of the State of Israel . So how do you square the circle of invoking to an American audience names like Martin Luther King and then going to an event in Cairo with the leaders of the Islamic jihad which is a wing of the Pasdaran of Iran , of sitting with the Hamas leadership while they -- after your meeting with them are quoted in Al-Hayat , in the Arabic press , still calling for armed struggle against the State of Israel ? Mustafa Barghouthi . </s>
I ca n't square the circle and you can not have U.N. membership , you can not have U.N. membership when you 're coming to the U.N. , when you 're going to the secretary general -- All right , we take -- -- I ca n't just let you have the floor forever . </s>
We got your point and we want to keep the point moving . But you want to cut me off . Thank you . Mustafa Barghouthi . </s>
You know , Dore , I want to ask you about the policy of Israel . I asked you about the policy of the Palestinians . </s>
I think -- And tell me about Cairo . You were there -- I want to ask you about the fact that Israel is the third largest -- </s>
No , Mustafa , he -- No , no , give me the chance to speak here . </s>
Israel is the third largest military exporter in the world . Exporter ? Yes , Israel is now -- has you know hundreds of nuclear heads . We all know that , so when you speak about peace and you speak about nonviolence , you might as well think of how Israel itself should stop using violence . </s>
Now , you said one of the arguments that were told here by Mr. Miller is that -- Wait , wait , wait . The reason I 'm intervening , there 's a lot of scores being settled here . </s>
And we 're traveling very far , and I 'm not disregarding or disrespecting the passion about these issues , but we 're trying to talk on the practicality or the morality either of this motion . And a very focused question was put to you -- -- but you 've already -- you took the moment to take a slam at Israel 's record , fine . </s>
No , no , no , no . But there 's a good point that he raised , and it 's the same reason I 'm interrupting you . There 's a good point that I would like to hear the answer to , and I think the audience as well , if in fact -- it 's very simple . </s>
If Hamas is part of this state and the U.N. is an organization devoted to peace , can you please just bring those -- reconcile those two things . It’s a pretty obvious question . There are two major important developments that have happened thanks to our work , thanks to our advocacy of non-violence , which is that I know there are several statements and you could pick up the bad ones , but the official position now of Hamas is to accept non-violence . </s>
This is a big achievement , and you should be happy about it . If people change positively , you should not get angry , as Mr. Gold does . Also , they are accepting ’67 borders . That’s an important change . </s>
Excuse me , can I make a point ? </s>
And when we -- Let him finish , yeah . When you speak about the Palestinian authority being incapable of controlling security , of course , because it’s under occupation . </s>
We are the first people in the human history who are asked to provide protection to their occupiers without being able to defend themselves from the occupiers . That makes no sense . We are saying we are ready to have international troops standing on the borders , even inside the Palestinian government state . We are ready to be totally demilitarized . We are , but we can not provide security to anybody and even to ourselves if we are not independent . </s>
Do you want to yield to Aaron ? Why going to the U.N. , why admission of the U.N will change the parameters for once ? </s>
The balance of power today is so much skewed in the interest of Israel , and Israel does what it wants . What we need to do is to change the balance of power . </s>
Okay , so let me bring -- We’re engaged -- with all due respect , I -- Aaron , can you come a little closer to the mic ? </s>
With all due respect to IQ2 U.S. -- I want to be invited back at some point -- we’re engaged in a kind of a thought experiment here . </s>
There’s a certain reality which we , once we leave this theater tonight , we’ll have to take account of there are only three ways that the Palestinian state will be born . Either the Palestinians will take it from the Israelis by force , which they are unable and I take you at your word , Mustafa , unwilling to do . Second , an international organization or body where the will of the international community will somehow deliver it to them on their behalf , but that is incredibly fanciful . The notion that admission into the U.N. will give you access to the ICC , the International Criminal Court , the Israelis will have their own case to be made against you . </s>
And , by the way -- What did you think of Mustafa’s response to Dore’s point , that in fact Hamas has accepted 1967 borders and -- That in itself is a -- I have a tremendous respect for you , Mustafa , but that is -- that strains the bounds of credulity to the breaking point -- And by the way , and by the way , this is a political organization which may , in fact , be undergoing a transformation . It is going to have to find a new home because the arc on the Assads is running south . </s>
No , what I’m saying to you is that if in fact there is a change , it is a process that will have to be demonstrated not in words and not in quiet conversation and not in Cairo -- Let’s bring in Daniel Levy . That is not -- that is not the main issue . I will come back to you . Why are you afraid of change ? </s>
Mustafa , Mustafa , I want to hear from your partner . </s>
And I’ll come back to Dore . I know this is an issue in which people , you know , kind of skate in and out , don’t have very deeply held feelings . </s>
I think it’s a shame that we’ve descended into a blame game here , and I want to try and pick up on the thread that I think Aaron was trying to reintroduce to the conversation . </s>
The Palestinians can take this by force . They can have it delivered to them by the international community . And I’m guessing where you’re going with the third one is they can convince the Israelis to actually withdraw . Or at least that’s where I would go with it . </s>
And if you’re about to tell me that they can wait for America to deliver it for them , then I suggest you see a production of “Waiting for Godot.” </s>
No , the point I want to make is that I think what the Israeli public needs to see right now , yes , there’s a continued -- there’s more of a Palestinian commitment and are continued by those who are already there , commitment to living alongside Israel , but I don’t think a charm offensive is the entirety of the ingredients that we have to bring into the mix . </s>
We have to bring in the ingredients which say to the Israelis , “Hey , I hope we’re moving away from violence , but we can’t sit on the sidelines while you swallow up all of Palestine . </s>
So we 're going to make declarative attempts . This does not mitigate against the fact that we want to live alongside you . We 're not trying to replace you at the UN . </s>
But we do have to begin to accumulate some beginnings of a balance of leverage , some addressing of this asymmetry . I think that 's productive for any future Israeli-Palestinian process . </s>
All right . I 'm going to -- I 'm going to come to the audience for questions in a moment . Dore Gold has been very patient waiting through two rounds for a chance to respond . Well , one of the purposes -- </s>
Dore Gold . One of the purposes of this discussion -- we 're in an academic setting . Academic setting means we have to distill what the truth is about certain situations . And we have to report the facts . And it is interesting to share those facts when you come from Cairo , or I come from Jerusalem . </s>
And unfortunately , there is the fact that five days after your meeting in Cairo , Hamas , on its official website , Palestine-info.info , Hamas made the following statement . `` We underline our adherence to our right to the struggle in all its forms , particularly the armed struggle . '' That 's not Martin Luther King . </s>
Sorry . </s>
And if I can just finish the sentence , it 's not the UN charter which is our subject for tonight . And you ca n't embellish this . You ca n't somehow treat it as though it 's not there , because you 're asking these people to vote for admission of Palestine to the UN . If Palestine involves arms struggle , are you prepared to vote for arms struggle against my people , the people of Israel ? I can quote here -- </s>
Mustafa Barghouthi . -- many Israelis , including rabbis and Mr. Lieberman , your foreign minister , who described Palestinians as crushers . But I 'm not going to do that . I -- I -- </s>
-- Hamas . </s>
There is some guy on the fringe of Hamas -- Sorry , sorry . So Avigdor Lieberman is some guy on the fringe of Israeli politics ? </s>
On the same day that Israeli negotiators sat with Palestinian negotiators in Amman , this week , last week , Foreign Minister Lieberman said , this is n't going anywhere . There 's not going to be a Palestinian state . </s>
The Likud platform says the government -- Excuse me , Daniel Levy . Daniel Levy . Dore , let him finish . I 'm against the establishment of Palestinian-Arab state . </s>
I 'm against Hamas ' position . But this is not coming from one side -- Daniel Levy , that 's called moral equivalents , Daniel Levy . </s>
Oh , do n't throw moral equivalents at me . Yes , it is . Because -- What delegitimizes Israel , which we do n't the border -- Daniel Levy , you ca n't -- </s>
What delegitimizes Israel is when -- Daniel Levy , you can not -- -- is when they maintain an occupation . All right . </s>
You can not compare -- Passions are running high… -- and debate is robust . I 'd like to go to audience questions please . </s>
-- Foreign Minister Lieberman did not call for murder , so do n't put him in the same box as Hamas . All right . You 're wrong . </s>
You can not -- What undermines the state of Israel is your continued settlement project . </s>
Daniel ? You think settlements are not a big deal . The settlements are the death knell , the death knell of Israeli democracy . </s>
Nobody is killing anybody . </s>
I 'm talking about our struggle . But the settlements aren’t backed by the Israeli military . The settlements exist in some kind of bubble , esoteric world of -- come on . </s>
The real world . Who defends the settlements ? The tooth fairy ? </s>
I 'm really sorry for Mr. Gold because you are really advocating the creation of apartheid . And that means killing the two-state option . You know , you know , what we aspire to here , and we just went to an episode of not doing it -- -- is actually to shed light by arguing relevant facts . And all of these facts may be relevant to the larger argument . We 're talking about the practicality or the morality of this motion . </s>
And we can talk about Cairo and who was at the meeting . And we got that point the very first time . </s>
And we can -- we know that Israel has a record that is offensive to the Palestinians . And we got that the first time . We would really ask you all to try to bring this level up to -- and I do think settlements are completely relevant , and you made that point well . But we would like to ask you to bring this up to a level of keeping this on the facts that are happening here . Now I 'm going to the questions . </s>
And I 'm -- I 'm -- I 'm counting on you folks to hear what I just said . </s>
So again , I urge to you really try to focus it as a question . Keep it on this point . We can not argue every point of history back to 1948 and before . And we 're trying to understand -- we 're trying to understand what will happen if this motion were to pass or if this motion were not to pass . Sir , and you 're wearing a pink shirt on the far right . </s>
Hi . I 'd like to ask Mr. Barghouthi a question . </s>
Two brief questions , one is -- I 'd like to just ask one . Pick one . </s>
Well , they 're so fast , it 's going to be less than -- Just pick one . I want him to answer one . Well , okay . One is there was a 10-month settlement freeze and the Palestinians , there 's no movement on the part of the Palestinians . </s>
And two is , in '47 -- I 'm sorry . </s>
All right . How is that -- sir , how does that relate to our motion directly ? to a motion . It 's a question about what he was talking about . Okay . </s>
Thank you , I 'm going to go on to another question . We 're trying to stay on the topic of this motion . With respect . </s>
Ma'am , right in the center . So staying away from the question of whether it should be a two-state solution , but going back into the argument before . What do you feel is the impact of passing a Palestine into the UN ? How does it impact the actual negotiation process ? </s>
So going back to what would actually -- I think Dore Gold said it would be -- -- take two steps back -- </s>
-- it would kill it . Did n't -- did Dore Gold not argue that it would be very detrimental to negotiations -- But I want to -- I want to understand from the side that 's arguing for , how do you actually deal with -- I mean , are you undermining negotiations by prematurely entering into this position . </s>
Okay . Let 's let Mustafa Barghouthi take that question . </s>
I have two questions . The first is about the 10-month settlements . The 10-month settlement to me , it 's -- actually , there was no freeze , because it did not include Jerusalem . It did not include what they call “natural growth.” So there was n't freeze . </s>
And Palestinians are trying their best , although I would agree with the tactics . But yesterday -- Mustafa , this audience is going to vote on what you said about the motion tonight . She asked a direct question about -- about the motion . If you could tell -- </s>
About the motion , yes . </s>
The second question is about the motion . And I want to say here that if we are admitted to the UN , the most important thing that will come out is that the illegal actions of settlements which are destroying the possibility of a two-state solution would be invalid . That means de facto creation of settlements on the ground does not undermine the right of the Palestinians to have a state . That will be good for peace and for two-state solution . </s>
Aaron David Miller , do you have a response to that ? It 's a very interesting answer . Well , I think it -- But could you come a little closer ? With all due respect , I think that exists in the level again of a thought experiment . </s>
It does n't . It is -- admission to the UN will not stop Israeli settlement activity . I would argue actually it 's going to accelerate it . And it will allow the Israelis to make it unmistakably clear to the Americans , who will , in fact , take their part in this , in large part because we - - </s>
Mustafa 's point is not -- not that the Palestinians would have more legal standing to resist . The legal standing to do what ? The day after you are admitted -- The fact -- </s>
Mustafa , let me finish . </s>
-- on the ground will not become fact -- Mustafa , let me finish . The day after you are admitted into the UN , nothing will change . </s>
And arguably -- and we 've been arguing about it . Nothing is going to change because neither -- you need two powers to support and make sovereignty meaningful to you . You may have given up on them . </s>
You may have convinced yourselves that their administrations are bankrupt , and they may offer you no hope . But it is a reality that unless you can take what you want by force , unless the international community is going to give it to you , which they will not . </s>
They will not . </s>
They have the Iranians , they have the Syrians . People are standing in line to sanction well ahead of what the international community would do with respect to the Israelis . </s>
Your ultimate objective is to create -- and I would agree with Daniel -- a different constellation of forces to support a negotiation , to end the conflict . But you can not create that improved balance by seeking admission into the UN . </s>
It will not improve your standing . And I have heard nothing in the last hour -- </s>
All right . Daniel -- Daniel , do you have -- -- to suggest that it will . Do you have something new to say to him ? </s>
But before that , one second , please . I did n't say that admission to the UN is the only factor that will change the balance . I said this is part of a bigger thing which is popular , nonviolent resistance . </s>
It 's diplomatic resistance within the context of something bigger . This will change parameters . But you 'll get the -- Daniel Levy . You 'll get the opposite reaction . </s>
Aaron , let me let Daniel Levy , because I did n't hear from him . Two responses , Aaron . First , I really beg to differ with you on what looks different the morning after Palestine 's admitted to the UN . </s>
In the following way , and this is n't just about Prime Minister Netanyahu and his coalition , but I do think that when Prime Minister Netanyahu can strut his stuff and say , `` You see , the international community does n't admit Palestine to the U.N. , '' I think that sends precisely the wrong signal to the Israeli public . I give credit to the Israeli public intelligence in knowing the cost benefit calculation of the signals they 're receiving are not affirmative enough yet regarding two states , and I think it 's that signal that matters , and I do think it 's not going to change everything but it would change something in the discourse if Palestine is admitted to the U.N . And that 's the kind of change that we need to begin to see happening . </s>
All right . We are in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan , your moderator . We have four debaters , two teams of two , arguing out this motion , `` The U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' </s>
And on to another question , yeah , you 're very enthusiastic and you 've got a red sweater . You asked for questions that would eliminate a good discussion here . </s>
Could you please define to me who are the Palestinians ? Whom are we negotiating with ? Wait , wait . </s>
I 'm going to let you elaborate . </s>
I want to -- I want to know what you 're -- </s>
I ca n't elaborate . I am sincerely asking . So you 're saying the PLO , the PA , the Hamas , are you confused or what ? </s>
Yes , I do n't -- I do not have a sense of a nation of people that are properly represented to have negotiations to make -- All right . I 'd like Mustafa Barghouthi to take this . </s>
There was once an Israeli prime minister by the name of Golda Meir . She said , `` Who are the Palestinians ? </s>
They do n't exist . '' Well , since then , Israel has been fighting with a non-existing people . </s>
And I feel -- I 'm so sorry that you think -- That you were nonviolent . I 'm so sorry that you think this way , ma'am , because denying the presence of people is nothing but a reflection of racism . We are there . </s>
We are there . </s>
We have our history . We 're 11 million people . Six million of us are in the Diaspora . You know what would surprise you most is how much Palestinians are similar to the Jewish people . </s>
The suffering you had , we have and we will get there one day . And you and us would be happy -- I just have to ask you , what is the premise of your question , the Golda Meier , `` Palestinians do n't exist '' thought , is that what you were -- No , I am -- </s>
Take the mic back . That 's why I asked for clarification . Are you saying there 's simply a splinter -- </s>
I would like to have a -- some kind of a description of whom are we talking about that we are negotiating with or not negotiating with , what is the entity that we can actually work with ? </s>
What is the actual -- Daniel Levy , do you want to take a very quick run at this ? </s>
Well , Israel signs agreements with the PLO or the agreements that Prime Minister Netanyahu signed that were referred to earlier , those are signed with the PLO , the Palestinian Liberation Organization . There 's negotiation right now as to whether on the conditions under which Hamas and other bodies will join the PLO . They 're not in the PLO at the moment . </s>
The PNC is in the PLO . Every member of the Palestinian parliament , which means the gentleman sitting next to me is included in the PLO , that 's who Israel -- Okay , let 's move on to another question . Sir , in the very center , dark sweater , you have -- wait for a microphone and please ask a question . And , by the way , ma'am , that was a question , and it was tightly focused , formally perfect . </s>
Thank you very much . </s>
Uh oh . Male Speaker Solid answer , I am a third party here . I heard this side . I heard this side . </s>
special like me , he mentioned about peaceful nation under Article Number 4 . </s>
I need you to get to a question in the next two sentences . So that is -- the question is whether Palestine is qualified to be a peaceful nation or not . The situation tells now that they do n't . </s>
And my comments on that are that they should be given another 100 years to go through the training and be a peaceful nation . Okay , I don’t think you’re going to get any argument from -- maybe from this side . And we’ve heard the response already because this side has made that argument , so I want to move on , ma’am . </s>
Ma’am , right there . Yeah , yeah , you just pointed to yourself . Oh , I’m sorry . I’m not sure whether there is a mic is on this side . </s>
It’s going to come -- right on the edge there -- no . Yeah , that’s it , that’s it , that’s it . Thank you . Hi . </s>
Hi . I think there are about 133 U.N. Security Council Resolutions against Israel or something like that . No ? </s>
I think you -- How many U.N. -- -- General Council with other U.N. bodies . Okay , well , how many U.N. resolutions have -- There are 41 U.N. vetoes against resolutions in the Security Council . </s>
Well , I wanted to know how many U.N. resolutions Israel has formally rejected against it and why , if it rejected those , it suddenly sees the viability of U.N. decisions in this case ? But it won’t . So I’m going to move onto another question . Ma’am , in the far left -- you’re right at the last seat against the wall , yeah . No , with respect , sorry . </s>
Hi . Thank you . </s>
I wanted to address this to Daniel Levy . The point that Mr. Miller made about that how can they control the guns , you’re saying that the PLO will be the one to take the seat at the U.N. Council . How will they then control the guns if there’s division within the Palestinian people ? You mean , how will they control the guns in Gaza ? Right . </s>
Daniel Levy . Yeah . I mean , as I’ve said , I think there are two ways of coming at this . First of all , call me curmudgeonly pessimist , but I don’t think the morning after Palestine’s admitted to the U.N. , Israel is going to say , “Ah , game’s up . </s>
We’re withdrawing to the ’67 lines now.” So , in practical terms , you know , I believe that this is about what signals do we send , even as an academic exercise . So in practical terms , I think it’s a crucial question , but it’s not the morning after we all vote tonight or you all vote tonight or Palestine is admitted to the U.N. What I do think is -- and you know , let’s be creative diplomatically here -- what I do think is you should be encouraging realistic terms for Palestinian reconciliation , for one authority with one gun . </s>
And I think part of the blend of how you do that could be using the very admission of Palestine to the U.N. , the very signing of that U.N. charter to hold Hamas to a certain standard on violence . Personally , I think , the -- Dore Gold , do you think that would happen ? -- condition were not a good idea . </s>
The violence one was . Dore Gold , do you think that’s what would happen ? </s>
Unfortunately , Hamas , and this is hard for us to understand this in the West , is a rigidly ideological organization . </s>
You know , in 2006 , Hamas won the Palestinian election , not just in Gaza Strip but also in the West Bank . </s>
And Mahmoud al-Zahar , who would become the Hamas foreign minister , was asked by a Western correspondent , “Are you willing to change the Hamas Charter from 1988 , which , by the way , does not call just for the destruction of Israel . It calls for the murder of Jews . It’s a genocidal document , and I have to use that language because that’s what it is . And do you know how al-Zahar responded in 2006 ? Not a single word . </s>
And many of us thought , you know , British Gas has found huge gas deposits offshore in the Mediterranean next to the Gaza Strip . They want to have commerce with the EU , with the world . They’ll change . </s>
They’ll be flexible . They’ll meet the Quartet conditions . </s>
Hamas , in 2006 until our conflict with them in 2008 , 2009 , didn’t move and still haven’t moved . Your answer is no . No , no , I’m not -- your partner wants to bring in a point . </s>
Daniel’s response to this -- Aaron David Miller . -- question , to me , is an indication of the fundamental problem . </s>
It isn’t thought through , Daniel . Your response to this young woman is simply not rigorously thought through . You 're assuming that we can create -- Go on . </s>
Help me with my lack of rigorous thinking Aaron -- No , no , that is not my -- I’m out of that business . I’m not here to help you think it through cleanly , but you are dispending a proposition that will in effect set into a motion a set of consequences over which you will have absolutely no control . This is the fundamental problem . Just because negotiations are stuck , and I am the first person to acknowledge just how stuck they really are -- does n't mean that in an effort to maintain hope , to diffuse desperation and to accommodate some measure of urgency , we need to pursue an idea that I would argue to you -- and you 've , in my judgment , failed to demonstrate where the real upsides are . </s>
The downsides of this are very , very real . In July 2000 , we decided to recommend to Bill Clinton to go to Camp David to try to create a conflict-ending solution between Israelis and Palestinians . Do you realize that a dozen years after that summit , we are still paying for the lack of wisdom and the recklessness of that decision ? </s>
Israelis and Palestinians have not yet recovered from the trauma of those ten years , because we believed in an effort to do something in the face of a desperate situation , that we could make it better . This notion -- Okay . -- is reckless , and it 's not well thought through . Daniel Levy to respond quickly . </s>
With all due respect -- with all due respect , Aaron , to American omnipotence , I think we can allow Israelis and Palestinians just a little bit of agency for what happened -- They can have all the agency they want . </s>
-- in the last dozen years . And I 'm sorry , Aaron . </s>
What you have failed to demonstrate is what is the negative impacts of having two states at the UN . What you 've failed to -- what have you said ? Because you -- No , sorry . You 've said this may harm Obama 's re-election . </s>
Well , I do n't think it 's realistic -- No , that 's not the major point . Okay . </s>
Let 's go on then . You have said -- you have said that it might lead to more settlements . You know what ? </s>
If the Israeli goal is to make this territory indivisible -- and I hope it 's not , but if that 's the goal , let 's start dealing with that reality . I do n't want to go there . You 've said it would undermine negotiations . </s>
Negotiations have gone nowhere . You 're the one who wrote that it was America acting as Israel 's lawyer that undermined that very Camp David effort that you just reminded us about . </s>
So come on . Give us a constructive proposal to move forward because we 've explained why this helps , and you have n't explained why it does n't . On the aisle here . </s>
Could you stand -- could you stand , please ? Thank you . </s>
Quick , yes , another question for Daniel Levy . Is it fair for the Israelis and the international community to expect that in return for what you support , the membership in the UN , that Hamas will say publicly and clearly and consistently , forevermore that they disavow violence in an arms struggle against Israel . </s>
Yes or no ? </s>
Daniel Levy . Do you want to concede to Mustafa on that , or do you want to take it , or share ? I do not think that the Palestinian right to self-determination , and therefore , by extension , Palestinian membership at the UN should be contingent on that . What I do think -- and I made clear here tonight -- I do not think that . </s>
I do n't think that Israel 's right to self-determination should be contingent on certain things that I believe Israel should stop doing , okay ? Not that I 'm drawing the . Mustafa . What I do think -- what I do think is we should use this , vis-a-vis Hamas . And I want to make another point here , because we 've spoken an awful lot about Hamas . </s>
And anyway , as people have noticed , there 's something going on in the Middle East . The Muslim Brotherhood , political Islam , of which Hamas is a part , is kind of popular when people get the chance to vote democratically . This is a reality we have to deal with . Now , we can bury our heads in the sand and say , there 's a charter , and you have to stand up and publicly disavow X , Y or zed , or we can work , work day in , day out , to try and create a new reality that Hamas relates to , to try and create a new reality that the Muslim Brotherhood relates to , to work with this new reality in the Middle East . </s>
And the more Israel buries its head in the sand and says , you have to tick boxes X , Y and zed before we do anything , the worst we are going to make are predicament . </s>
All right , Mustafa Barghouthi . But on one side , we are told we would not be able to progress because Palestinians are divided . But then the same people , Israel and Mr. Gold , are against Palestinian unity . </s>
What we are working on , what we have achieved , actually , through the most recent negotiations is that Hamas officially declared , on the words of Khaled Meshal , that they are committing to nonviolence . I am trying to explain that to you , and you -- you do n't want even to hear it , because if change is happening in the positive direction , what you see today is -- there is no violence in -- </s>
But Mustafa , let me make this point . And -- no , no , but just one last point . If you -- what Mr. Miller is reporting is just specifically a continuation of the status quo . </s>
And we are saying this is dangerous , because today you have the whole Palestinian camp ready to accept nonviolence . If nothing changes , if a solution is not found , if we do n't move forward , then things will get worse . </s>
Is that what we want ? </s>
We want to find a solution . </s>
And when we say we are admitting -- we are committing to nonviolence , we are doing diplomatic resistance , Israel should be happy about that , because that opens the road for a solution . But -- but -- </s>
-- just staying on the same course means -- Okay , Mustafa , I 'm interrupting because you 've made this point . But Dore Gold has left hanging out there several very alarming statements made by Hamas . </s>
Exactly . -- very recently that do not suggest a commitment to nonviolence . </s>
So -- so I just need you -- I just need you to -- I just need you to tell us , what do we do with those statements ? What is the ? What did you do in Iraq ? </s>
What did you do in Iraq ? What was the Sunni awakening that you worked with ? Were these people who were shooting Americans , did you ask them to make all kinds of pretty statements ? </s>
You faced a tough situation . What are you doing now with the Taliban ? </s>
Sometimes you have to mix it with unpleasant , unsavory elements . </s>
This is n't a lesson in how to primly have nice tea parties . This is a hard reality -- Aaron David Miller . </s>
Daniel , if you -- if you -- </s>
Aaron David Miller . All right . Let him respond , and then I 'll come to you . </s>
The fact that Mr. Zahar and others came out against Meshal is proving my point , because that means that a division is happening there . </s>
But the official spokesperson , the leaders of this movement are admitting this . If this positive change is creating opposition within that organization , that is another proof that this is serious . Okay . And at the end of the day , the Palestinians are coming to the United Nations and saying , we are committed to nonviolence as the PLO and as Palestinians . Aaron David Miller . </s>
Look , in a negotiation , at least this negotiation , even if you were admitted as a member state , the logic of your analysis just is n't good enough . You are going to need a monopoly over the organized forces of violence in your society , even to induce the Israelis or even by extension the Americans . But is n't that what you praised in the West Bank today ? </s>
To help broker a solution on -- Aren’t you praising the government in the West Bank for having done that . Can I finish ? On the four core issues that drive the conflict , you will need one gun , one authority and one negotiating . </s>
Is n't that the case here ? But you do n't have that . And the presumption is that you should be admitted into the United Nations as a full member state without it . But he 's saying that they do -- that you do have it . In the West Bank , and he is praising it . </s>
He is praising Mr. Fayyad on -- </s>
On this point , he 's saying that in fact that controls in the West Bank . Is n't that the case today in the West Bank ? </s>
Sadly , as a consequence of the Oslo process , the area that you do control , you 've actually done it as a consequence of intimate security cooperation with the Israelis and assisted by the United States and the Jordanians quite a lot , yes . So why are you unhappy ? And you 're building the institutions of statehood . </s>
But it 's a far cry to assume that your national movement right now is unified and cohesive enough to warrant what it is you seek . Right now -- and I do n't mean to trivialize this . The Palestinian national movement is literally like Noah 's ark . </s>
There are two of everything . </s>
There are two Constitutions . There are two sets of security services . There are two polities . There are two independent entities -- </s>
At least we have a Constitution . Israel does not have a constitution . Neither does Great Britain . On this narrow point -- on this narrow point -- </s>
Daniel -- Daniel , the Noah 's ark point . What I 'm hearing is that a case has been made . What I 'm hearing is a lot of obfuscation from the other side . What I 'm not hearing is , how do we advance this in a different way ? What I 've not heard -- </s>
That 's not their -- </s>
I know . </s>
I know . I know . But we 're making a case . </s>
We 're making a case for how you can begin to lay down a marker on a rapidly evaporating two-state prospect . And all we 've heard -- and I thought we 'd hear it . And even -- I do think there 's some onus on the other side to do a little more than give us an hour and a half of nay saying . </s>
I 'm sorry , but I really -- If the proposition -- John , can I -- can I respond ? Yes . Yes , you can . If the proposition that IQ2 US wanted to sponsor was , is Israeli-Palestinian peace possible , then we could have had a discussion . </s>
But the assertion that is made here -- the motion is -- you are asserting that Palestine should be admitted as a member state . And it is our -- it was our objective -- we may not have succeeded to your satisfaction -- </s>
Okay . -- perhaps even to the audience 's , demonstrate why in fact that course of action -- What you are suggesting , Mr. Miller , is that we give Israel the time to finish the settlement project . </s>
I 'm not suggesting that at all . You premised a lot of your argument on -- Who 's the question for ? </s>
Mr. Barghouthi . Okay . You premised a lot of your argument on claims about the balance of power between Israel and the Palestinians . The last negotiation in my mind is one in which the Israelis traded one soldier for hundreds of Palestinian terrorists -- thousand -- excuse me . </s>
And I 'm wondering , given the willingness on one side -- on behalf of one side of the debate , namely the Palestinians , to send in young boys and girls to kill themselves , how can you argue that the piece of cheese is entirely on the side of Israel and that the Palestinians are left with nothing to do ? It seems like the willingness to commit suicide leaves them with a lot to do and transforms radically this balance of power which you 're arguing has completely shifted to the side of the Israelis . You are a young man . </s>
You are a young man . And I think as a young person -- I 'm responding to your question -- no , I 'm saying as a young person , and I admire young people , you should look into the reality today , not keep talking about the past . What you are describing -- what you are describing is something that is a long time disappeared . And if we keep going back to the past , we will not find a way to the future . You 're asking why Israel exchanged one prisoner for 1,000 Palestinian prisoners , because Palestinians had only one prisoner . </s>
And , by the way , by the way , by the way , there are still 5,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails . Do you know how it feels -- do you know how it feels -- what is strange to me is why when the Oslo agreement was signed , not all of the Palestinian prisoners were released , why did it take Hamas to capture an Israeli soldier so that spent 33 years in jail had to be released ? Why could n't they be released ? Because of the peace agreement . This is the mistake . </s>
One last question . Little far from the U.N. Can we keep it on the issue ? Can you come forward ? Come forward into the -- so the camera can see you . </s>
I 'd like to address my question to Daniel Levy and Dr. Barghouthi . This is a question of context , gentlemen , which I do n't think we 've heard in this debate . </s>
The last legitimate democratic election in Palestinian areas was won by the Hamas convincingly in 2006 . The Palestinians , the PLO , Fatah as the lead faction of the PLO has failed to conduct negotiations in January 2010 and subsequent . So the only legitimate government in the eyes of the Palestinian people today is the Hamas . On the basis of Mr. Haniya in Gaza , he is the legitimate Palestinian leader in the eyes of the Palestinian people . </s>
All right -- So how do you argue that the Israelis should be -- that the Israeli public should be comfortable with a legitimate sovereign called the `` PLO '' when in the eyes of the Palestinians , the majority of the Palestinians , it is only the Hamas that was the sideline and jailed and tortured by the Fatah , legitimate Palestinian leadership ? Mustafa Barghouthi . </s>
Let me clarify one point here . When Hamas won election , they got 44 percent of the votes and Fata got 41 percent . It was the stupidity of Fatah , who did not accept full proportional system that led to Hamas getting a majority in the parliament . </s>
Today I assure you there is a growing number of Palestinians that want to see a third alternative , which I think we represent . And I do not think that either Hamas or Fatah will get an absolute majority in any future elections . What you should encourage is that Palestine becomes a full state democracy with pluralism . </s>
I always believed and I still believe that the only way to have a peaceful -- a lasting peace between both sides is if we have two democracies negotiating an agreement and not to have an agreement enforced from one side to another . All right . Thank you . And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . And here’s where we are . </s>
We are about to give brief closing statements from each debater in turn . Those closing statements will be two minutes each . And after those statements , we will ask you to vote on this debate and choose the winner . Our motion is “The U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state.” </s>
And here to summarize his position against this motion , Aaron David Miller , a former U.S. Mideast peace negotiator , advisor to six secretaries of State , author of a book coming out in September of 2012 called , “Can America Have Another Great President ? ” Aaron David Miller . Yeah , thank you very much . I realize that in the last 90 minutes that perhaps one of the most astute things that I’ve done , one of the best decisions I’ve made was to leave the Arab-Israeli negotiating process . And I say that with tremendous respect and affection for everybody on this panel . </s>
If the goal is achieving statehood , if that is really the goal , then it seems to me that U.N. admission simply doesn’t make much sense . </s>
You alienate the two countries that Palestinians will need -- Israel and the United States -- to produce meaningful and legitimate Palestinian sovereignty . </s>
You will kill Salam Fayyad’s nation-state building effort . There’s no question about that . And you’re putting your hope in an international community that has never ever abandoned you , actually , but isn’t capable of delivering your sovereignty . And I would argue that even though , Dan , you persist in saying that we haven’t demonstrated what the downsides are , I think given , in my judgment , the risks of admission and the uncertainties that will certainly follow , other than hope , which is extremely important , and diffusing a measure of desperation , even more important , you haven’t demonstrated how in effect U.N. membership will bring Mustafa Barghouthi and his people any closer , any closer to negotiating Jerusalem borders , security , refugee into meaningful statehood . Maybe the strategy has more to do with internal Palestinian politics with Mahmoud Abbas’s exit strategy , with the Arab spring and the Arab winter , with a full reconciliation with Hamas . </s>
In effect , if that is your objective , well then maybe you should seek U.N. admission but not if you want to facilitate the negotiations . My good friend , Daniel Levy , wrote the day before yesterday , the PLO strategy -- the PLO has a bad case of strategic combobulation . And the U.N-Palestinian effort was a weak -- a damp squib , a damp squib -- damp squib -- Aaron , I have to set you -- one more sentence , please . </s>
If Daniel Levy doesn’t believe it , which I don’t think he does , then why should -- No subordinate clauses . Then why should we believe it ? Thank you , Aaron David Miller . Our motion is “The U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state , ” and here to summarize his position in support of this motion , Daniel Levy , former Israeli peace negotiator and senior fellow at the New America Foundation . </s>
What I said was right . </s>
I think the Palestinians should pursue this in a different way , and it’s going to take time , but there’s a strategy for getting there . We’ve spoken a lot here about Hamas . </s>
But I think the way you further empower Hamas and discourage change in Hamas is to close all nonviolent diplomatic options in the face of the Palestinians . I know people here . And I also don’t like to hear the word “apartheid.” </s>
Here’s what the Israeli minister of defense , Ehud Barak , said in February 2010 , “The simple truth , there is one state including Israel , the West Bank and Gaza . It’s either bi-national or undemocratic.” That will be an apartheid state . That’s the tragedy that we want to prevent . </s>
And you know what ? Our toolbox is an impoverished one because we have tried so much already . </s>
But sticking exclusively with negotiations really must be the dumbest idea . So what do we have left that’s nonviolent . </s>
Let’s use the international tools of diplomacy that are at our disposal to make a statement . </s>
We haven’t heard negative consequences that can come from this . And mostly we haven’t heard what else to do except to blindly continue to place our faith in negotiations or that the Palestinians somehow should only be ingratiating themselves without creating any leverage with Israel and America . </s>
It’s been tried . It hasn’t worked . The risk is the status quo . </s>
The risk is the continued dissent of Israeli democracy to a place where it will be unrecognizable and an inability to reach a two-state solution . We need to send a signal here from this room that Palestine should be admitted to the UN . </s>
And the UN needs to send a signal to Israelis and Palestinians that there 's going to be a two-state solution , otherwise the next debate will be about equal rights in one indivisible territorial unit . </s>
I 'm not against equal rights in democracy , but I want an Israel , an Israel that 's different , that changes . But I want an Israel . And I 'm sure Mustafa wants a Palestine . </s>
And we should have both of those as member states of the UN . Daniel Levy , your time is up . Thank you . Our motion is , `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' </s>
And here to summarize his position against the motion , Dore Gold , former Israeli ambassador to the UN and former advisor to Prime Minister Netanyahu . </s>
These are -- this is a very important issue . And I am sorry that at certain points in this discussion we got heated . </s>
But the stakes are not just winning a debate in this very nice auditorium in NYU . This is about issues that relate to our very existence . I started , before I was cut off earlier on , telling you that when we withdrew from the Gaza strip in 2005 , we had great hopes that we were removing a cause , an irritant , and therefore , Prime Minister Sharon , whom I knew very well , decided to take that risk and pulled out unilaterally . And instead of rocket fire dropping as a result , it increased between 2005 and 2006 by 500 percent . The state of Israel is obligated to make sure that whatever arrangement we make on the West Bank does n't replicate the conditions in the Gaza Strip . </s>
Unfortunately , unfortunately , Mahmoud Abbas has decided on a course of action that he actually began at the end of the Olmert government . </s>
It 's a course of unilateralism . And with this unilateralism is an effort to get recognized as a Palestinian state with UN membership , without having to address our concerns , without having to address the security of Israel , without having to recognize my people 's right to a nation state , even though I 'm being asked to recognize his people 's right to a nation state . </s>
And finally , to predetermine the outcome of negotiations by going to the UN and saying , the borders will be June 4 , even though the UN back in '67 said we were n't going back to the exact '67 lines . And therefore , I suggest to you , particularly in light of the fact that we 're seeing an effort to sell you an unreformed Hamas , and unreformed Islamic Jihadist part of the Palestinian political community , to reject the notion that the Palestinians should be accepted as a member state until they change . </s>
Thank you , Dore Gold . Our motion is , `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' </s>
And here to summarize his position in support of this motion , Mustafa Barghouthi , member of the Palestinian parliament and leader of the Palestinian National Initiative . Thank you . Mr. Gold has repeated practically what Weisglass , who was an advisor to Mr. Sharon when he said that we withdraw from Gaza so that we can put peace in formaldehyde . We can put peace to sleep . </s>
Unfortunately , creating fear is not a solution . And everything that Mr. Miller and Gold have suggested today is nothing but wasting time and using time . </s>
And I am telling them , you can maybe afford to lose time because you have n't lived for 44 years under occupation . You have n't lived in this position for a long time . And you have n't been humiliated every day by occupying forces . </s>
You can maybe even afford to be sarcastic , gloomy , and even depressed . But that will not bring change . Yes , the peace process has become a substitute to peace , and that 's why we need to change the situation . </s>
I can not afford to lose time because this is about my life , about my daughter 's life , and it 's about the lives of the Palestinians and Israelis . And the Israelis themselves can not afford it . </s>
When I ask people , what do you want ? They say we want jobs , we want education , and we want health care . </s>
We could not have had that -- we could n't have that because we have occupation . And this needs to end . What the Israelis want is also security . But that also can not be available as long as Palestinians are insulted and humiliated . Where Azizi in Tunisia created a revolution because he brought the issue of dignity to people 's minds . </s>
And every day , thousands of Palestinians dignity is harmed . What we are trying to say to bring light in the end of the tunnel . When you vote today , do n't take away hope . Do n't take away light at the end of the tunnel . And let me remind you here with what Plato said . </s>
He said , “We can easily forgive children for being afraid of dark . The tragedy is when grown people are afraid of light . '' Thank you , Mustafa Barghouthi , very much . And that concludes our closing statements . </s>
And now it 's time to learn which side this audience feels has argued best . We 're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seat and to push the keypad whose number corresponds to the side that you feel argued best . </s>
Our motion is `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' If you feel this side , the side in support , argued best , push number one . If you feel the side against , this side argued best , push number two . If you remain or became undecided , push number three . And as I said before , just correct it , and you 'll get the last one come in correctly . </s>
So I want to -- there is no need to apologize for bringing a little bit of heat to the conversation tonight . </s>
In fact , it was justified and passionate . But I also have a thing for light . And so I like to bring as much light as heat . </s>
And I think that ultimately this team -- both teams rose to that . </s>
And I want to thank you for hearing each other and for hearing me . And debating this honestly and fairly . And I also want to thank members of the audience who had the guts to get up and ask questions . And the vast majority were very good and very on point and really did move this along . </s>
So a round of applause to those of you who are able to get up and ask questions . So we 'll have the vote -- the results of the vote in just a minute . </s>
What I 'll do is I 'll read off the preliminary numbers for , against and undecided , and then the final numbers , for , against and undecided . And the team with the largest difference will be declared our winner . In the meantime , very briefly , I want to tell you about our next debate . </s>
It 's coming up on February 7th . And in light of the fact that there is a health crisis in this country of many , many varieties , but we 're going to be talking about the obesity epidemic , with 33 percent of adults in this country , and 17 percent of children obese , we thought it was time to find a way to look at this issue as a matter of debate . And the way that we 're looking at it is whether -- where is the issue of personal responsibility and government responsibility in this in terms of , are people obese simply because they eat too much , or are they obese because they 're being advertised to because of what 's in food , and additives , the proliferation of fast food . And does government have a role in that or not . Basically , whose fault is it ? </s>
And who should do something about it ? Arguing in support of the following motion : `` Obesity is the government 's business” will be Pamela Peeke , also a medical doctor . She 's a nationally renowned physician , a scientist and an expert in the fields of nutrition and fitness . </s>
And on web MD , she is the chief lifestyle expert . The team arguing against this , that 's saying obesity is not the government 's business , is Paul Campos . He is author of `` The Obesity Myth . '' He 's a Constitutional law professor who came to this issue in an unusual way . He was watching all of the coverage of the Monica Lewinsky story back in the late '90s , and he became obsessed with the obsession in the news media over Monica Lewinsky 's weight . </s>
And he just started thinking . And he ended up writing some books and has strong points of view on this issue . And his debating partner , also arguing that it is not the government 's business , but a matter of personal responsibility , John Stossel , an Emmy award-winning journalist . </s>
He is host of FOX Business Network 's Stossel , a weekly program that highlights consumer issues . He is a contrarian . </s>
If you know him , who would like government to stop meddling in people 's business . </s>
And he is himself a very , very slender television correspondent . And I can -- I can only admire him . So we 'll take just about 30 seconds more . And the results will come to us . </s>
But thank you very much for your patience . Okay . </s>
I 've got them . </s>
I 've just been given the results . Remember now , we had you vote twice . </s>
You 've heard this debate , this argument , the arguments for and against this motion , `` The UN should admit Palestine as a full member state . '' We asked you to vote before and again afterwards . The vote afterwards telling us which side you feel presented the better argument . Before the debate , 37 percent were in support of the motion that the U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state , 30 percent were against , and 33 percent were undecided . After the debate , 55 percent support this motion , that is up 18 percent , 37 percent are against , that is up only seven percent , the undecideds went down by 25 percent to eight percent . </s>
That means the motion has carried , the side arguing the U.N. should admit Palestine as a full member state has won this debate . Our congratulations to them . </s>
Thank you from me , John Donvan , and Intelligence Squared U.S. We 'll see you next time . … And now I’d like to introduce Robert Rosenkranz , who is the chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , and the sponsor of Intelligence Squared , who will frame tonight’s debate . Bob ? This is Bob . </s>
Well thank you very much . And , uh , uh , on behalf of , uh , Dana Wolfe , our executive producer and myself , uh , I’m just , uh , thrilled to welcome you . When we scheduled this event some , uh , five months ago , we had no idea it would be so timely . Just in the past month the , uh , Mitchell Report was released , naming some eighty eight Major League Baseball players alleged to have used steroids and , uh , uh , other drugs . Roger Clemens’ denials have been heard in 60 Minutes and were front page news in Sunday’s New York Times . </s>
Uh , record breaking sprinter Marion Jones was sentenced to six weeks in prison- , or six months , I should say , in prison , for lying to a federal grand jury about steroid use . Uh , Congressional hearings , uh , on steroid use and the Mitchell Report actually started today in Washington . </s>
Uh , closer to home , just a few days ago , Ben Johnson dropped out as our panelist on his counsel’s insistence , because of Johnson’s involvement in a le- , a related legal case that was just noticed for trial . </s>
Well timely we certainly are , but what is the debate ? This is not a debate about whether cheating in sports should be accepted . That would hardly be interesting . </s>
Instead , it’s about whether the rules governing professional sports should ban performance-enhancing drugs . After all , we routinely use performance-enhancing drugs , uh , to enhance our , uh , mental performance . A virtual pharmacopoeia of drugs is used to help people , including minors , stay awake , improve concentration , alter moods . </s>
And the whole point of competitive sports is for spectators to see athletes striving to be the very best they can be . We want their training and equipment to use the best science and technology . So why is the use of performance-enhancing drugs an exception ? Is there persuasive evidence that these drugs are health risks ? </s>
If so , how do those risks stack up against the risk athletes assume every day by getting into a racing car or a boxing ring , or on a football field or a baseball diamond ? Why shouldn’t athletes make their own informed determinations about risks and benefits of performance-enhancing drugs ? And how should we think about the wisdom of rules that are inherently so intrusive and difficult to enforce ? </s>
Well to help us grapple with these interesting questions , we have an exciting panel , including professional athletes and medical experts . And as our moderator , we have Bob Costas , perhaps the most famous sportscaster in television and radio today . Bob , the evening is yours . Thank you again , Bob . So this is the sixth debate of the second Intelligence Squared US Series . </s>
The resolution being debated tonight is formally , you know what it is , but formally it is , we should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports . Here’s a brief overview of the way the evening will work . Members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument , and the presentations are limited to seven minutes each . </s>
When opening arguments are complete , I’ll open up the floor to brief questions from the audience . And after the Q & A , each debater will make a final two minute summation . And finally , you vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad attached to the armrest of your seat , and I’ll announce your decision on which side carried the day or the evening , when , uh , the festivities conclude . Let’s start with a pre-debate vote . </s>
Please pick up the keypad attached to the armrest on your left . For audience members sitting along the aisle to my right , your keypad is attached to the audience on your right side next to your neighbor . So , the resolution is , we should accept performance- enhancing drugs in competitive sports . After my prompt , please press one to vote for the motion , two to vote against the motion , or three if you are undecided . </s>
You may begin voting now . Has everybody cast their initial vote ? You’re all set ? All right . Now to introduce the panel . </s>
And please hold your applause until all six are introduced . </s>
For the motion , former policy analyst for the Cato Institute , senior editor and investigative journalist for Reason magazine , Radley Balko on the far end . Professor of pediatrics and bio-ethics , and director of the program in medical ethics at the University of Wisconsin , Norman Fost . And Uehiro chair in practical ethics at the University of Oxford , and director of the Oxford Center for Practical Ethics , Julian Savulescu . Against the motion , former host and creator of the Sports Machine , the award-winning sportscaster George Michael . The former Atlanta Brave two-time National League MVP , multiple Golden glo- , Glove Award-winner , and founder of the I Won’t Cheat Foundation , Dale Murphy . </s>
And the former chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency from 1999 through 2007 , chancellor of McGill University and partner at the Canadian law firm Stikeman Elliot , Richard Pound . For most of the evening as points of view are exchanged , all of us will be seated , but as each debater makes his initial seven minute presentation , we will call him to the podium . And we will begin with someone who is for the motion , “We should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports , ” Norm Fost . Norm ? </s>
Thank you . Everyone in this room uses performance-enhancing technology and drugs . We use cars and computers to make our work more efficient . </s>
We use caffeine , alcohol , and Viagra to improve our performance . </s>
We send our children to fancy schools and Suzuki lessons to improve their cognitive skills , and enhance their musical ability . </s>
And every athlete in recorded history has used performance-enhancing drugs . </s>
Babylonians and Romans used herbs to improve their performance in battle . </s>
Naked Greeks put on shoes to run faster . Kenyan runners trained at altitude to improve their oxygen-carrying capacity . And runners everywhere carbo-loaded before races to enhance their performance . </s>
Why then , do we have a replay of the Salem witch trials ? To discredit , humiliate , and incarcerate , uh , elite athletes for doing what has been a standard practice for millennia ? And why , out of the thousand and one ways in which athletes enhance their performance , have steroids and growth hormone been selected for particular vilification ? The short answer is that they’re illegal and that these athletes are breaking the rules and perhaps the law , and therefor it’s immoral . </s>
But this begs the question , as Mr. Rosenkranz said , why are they banned in the first place ? We contend that the reasons given are morally incoherent , wreak of hypocrisy , and are based on ice cold wrong information . I will identify six reasons that are offered why we should ban these drugs . Number one , critics say that they confer an unfair advantage . But advantages are only unfair if they’re unequally distributed . </s>
The usual solution is to expand access . When Bob Seagren showed up at the ’72 Olympics in- , with a fiberglass pole , it was not banned , but , a- , uh , there was a time to allow others to practice with it , and it was incorporated . When Kenyan runners were found to enhance their performance by raising their hemoglobin by training at altitude , the reaction was not to ban abnormally high hemoglobins , or to prohibit others from training at altitude , but to encourage everyone to do it . </s>
The unfair advantage aim , uh , the unfair advantage claim is further undermined by rampant hypocrisy . In the ’88 Olympics , when Ben Johnson lost his gold medal because of steroid use , on the same day and the same press den , Janet Evans , the American swimmer who had won the 5k swim , bragged about the greasy swimsuit that we had kept secret from the East Germans . Johnson used a drug that was available to everyone , although illegally , virtually on the training room tables . Evans used a secret technology available to none of her competitors and bragged about it . The press cheered American ingenuity and made Johnson a pariah . </s>
Bud Selig , the baseball commissioner , preaches about a level playing field , but presides over a league where the Yankees’ payroll is three to four times that of most competitors , including my beloved Brewers , and guess what ? The Yankees always make the playoffs . Two , critics say these drugs are harmful , but they rely on information that’s wiley- , wildly exaggerated or just fabricated . We are told repeatedly that these drugs use heart disease , cancer , and stroke , while human growth hormone has been given to almost a million children for fifty years , and there’s still no real serious side effects that have been discovered . </s>
Oral testosterone dis- , did cause liver cancer , but for twenty years athletes have been using injectables , which have never been associated with cancer . Lyle Alzado the football player , was a poster child for the horrors of steroids . He died of a brain tumor . </s>
Then the New York Times and Sports Illustrated told us on cover stories that this was due to steroids without a single quote from an informed physician or a single source showing any association with steroids , because there is none . But still , Costas , I mean , excuse me , uh , Alzado… </s>
That is deep- , deeply , deeply Freudian . …eh…Alzado is constantly rolled out as a poster child for the horrors of steroids . </s>
I ask you in the audience to quickly name , in your own minds , a single elite athlete who’s had a stroke or a heart attack while playing sports . It’s hard to come up with one . </s>
Anabolic steroids do have undesirable side effects : acne , baldness , voice changes , intrangent infertility . But sport itself is far more dangerous , and we don’t prohibit it . The number of deaths from playing professional football and college football are fifty to a hundred times higher than even the wild exaggerations about steroids . More people have died playing baseball than have died of steroid use . </s>
Three critics say that allowing their use is coercive , that you’re forced to use them . But the first year that baseball did universal testing , anonymous testing , only six percent of the players were positive . From those numbers , it seems that 94 % were able to play at a very high level and didn’t feel coerced at all . Coercion is the use or threat of force that 's never occurred in this country to the best of my knowledge . There is no entitlement to play professional sports ; it’s a privilege requiring an enormous sacrifice and taking on enormous risks , with or without steroids . </s>
Many walk away from it and choose not to do it , and no one is forced to take it on . Four , critics claim that steroids undermine fan interest , and this is simply empirically false , baseball attendance has ridden steadily in the steroid era , professional football is even more popular , and Barry Bonds , widely assumed to be a steroid user , is the biggest draw in sports , adding ten thousand fannies in the seats everywhere he goes . Chicks love the long ball , guys love the long ball , they don’t care what they 're using . </s>
Fifth , critics claim that steroids undermine the integrity of records . This is naïve , the records are not comparable with or without steroids or growth hormone . </s>
Baseball fences are shorter , the mound is lower , the ball is livelier , and Coors Field is a mile above sea level . By one estimate , Babe Ruth playing in today’s ball parks would hit a thousand home runs , not the mere seven hundred and fifty that Hank Aaron and Bonds have hit . The only valid comparison is with peers playing in the same arenas with the same equipment against the same opponents , and Ruth hit more home runs in one season than any other team . He is in a league of his own , and no one has come close . </s>
Finally , critics claim that steroids present bad role modeling for children— One minute . Everyone agrees these drugs should be banned for children . </s>
The adverse effects are different , they stunt growth , they are not competent to make informed choices . I support testing in schools , not to punish the kids , but to catch the peddlers . Anyone caught selling drugs to children should be hung , followed by a fair trial . In closing , when you go out to dinner tonight , enjoy the wine that relaxes you , or start your day tomorrow with a double mocha latte that gets you going , but please be less critical of others who , like you , try to enhance their performance in a variety of ways . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Dr. Fost . </s>
And now speaking against the motion , Dick Pound . Thank you . This evening’s debate deals with one of the most important problems facing sport today : doping , the use of performance enhancing drugs and methods . </s>
It’s important because it affects the health of the athletes who practice it , and those who emulate the sport heroes thought they admire . It’s important because it goes to the very heart of sport and its integrity . I want to focus on two elements in this portion of my remarks : health and integrity . So let’s start at the beginning . </s>
Sport , like this debate , is governed by rules , to which the participants agree . </s>
In fact , the rules are the essential element of sport as we know it . </s>
Some of them may seem arbitrary , why the race is a hundred meters as opposed to ninety-five or a hundred and five , but they are the rules , and they are the rules on which we agree . </s>
One of those sport rules is that participants do not take certain drugs or use certain methods for performance enhancement . And also , we should be clear here , until there is a rule against the use of something , it may be foolish , it may be dangerous , but it ca n't be criticized as a breach of ethics or a rule of conduct . Don’t get led off into the wilderness by examples from ancient Greece and so forth that preceded the rules that we now face today . </s>
Once there is a rule , however , that becomes the deal , and part of the game , whether the rule relates to drugs , equipment , or anything else central to the sport . And those rules become our deal with each other’s , other , as participants . If you don’t like the rules , unlike society in general , you 're not obliged to participate . You can find somebody who wants to play by the rules that you prefer . </s>
Almost all of the prohibited substances and methods have the potential to damage the health of the athletes . In the 1950’s and 1960’s before there were rules , veterinary products were used to beef up the human cattle . Shot putters went from throwing from sixty feet to seventy feet . It’s true , they had terminal acne , testicles the size of jelly beans , a sperm count of zero , and were in a perpetual rage , but boy , they could sure toss the shot a lot further . </s>
The initial anti-doping rules were adopted mainly as a result of concerns regarding health . </s>
A Danish cyclist died during the 1960 Olympics in Rome , that was the Olympics in which I participated . And he died as a result of drug use . He did n't just get sick , or incur a long term health problem , or fall off his bike and skin his knees . He died . If a particular sport rule proves to be no good or unnecessary , or in need of amendment , the sport can change it . </s>
There’s no problem about that . But you as a participant can not do it unilaterally and clandestinely . Why do you suppose that no one , no one with any responsibility , let me underline that , is willing to say let the athletes do whatever they want ? Even the professional leagues don’t say that . They know perfectly well there’s a danger to health . </s>
With the rules comes a question of trust . We have expectations of each other that we play in accordance with the rules that we agreed upon as part of our participation , including rules prohibiting drug use . We’re ready to demonstrate that compliance at any time , that’s also part of our deal . </s>
We don’t hide behind spurious claims of privacy . We agree on the penalties if there’s a breach of the rules . </s>
And the sport rules on drug use are no different from sport rules regarding such things as gambling . Pete Rose has been kept out of the Baseball Hall of Fame because of gambling , because nobody was really sure whether they were watching real sport . In the , in more modern times , my , my view is that Henry Aaron has a record , Barry Bonds has a number . </s>
When there’s a breach of that trust , you have to see what it is . And drug use in sport is no more or no less than cheating , and in most cases , dangerous cheating . </s>
Remember that , that athletes don’t take these drugs to level the playing field . </s>
They do it to get an advantage . And if everyone else is doing what they 're doing , then instead of taking ten grams or ten cc 's or whatever it is , they’ll take twenty , or thirty , or forty , and a vicious circle simply gets bigger . The end game will be an activity that’s increasingly violent , extreme , and meaningless , practiced by a class of chemical and/or genetic mutant gladiators . The use of performance enhancing drugs is not accidental , it is planned and deliberate with the sole objective of getting an unfair advantage . </s>
I don’t want my kids , or your kids , or anybody’s kids to have to turn themselves into chemical stockpiles just because there are cheaters out there who don’t care what they promised when they started to participate . I don’t want my kids in the hands of a coach who would encourage , condone , or allow the use of drugs among his or her athletes . I was always struck by Vince Lombardi , a wonderful coach . </s>
There’s one thing he said that I wish he had n't , when he said , “Winning is the only thing.” It’s not . I liked it much better when he said , “If you 're not fired with enthusiasm , you will be fired with enthusiasm.” That’s a much better message . So , going forward , what we need is an increased change of attitude . </s>
Cheating in sport destroys everything— </s>
One minute . …that the athletes set out to accomplish . It turns them , among other things , into liars . Marion Jones persisted with a lie for more than seven years . Ben Johnson lied to me in 1988 . </s>
I was really looking forward to having him here tonight , twenty years later . It’s too bad his lawyers pulled him out of this at the last minute . But attitudes can change , even big attitudes like this . If , if ten years ago I had said that in ten years from today it would be illegal to smoke a cigarette in a restaurant in Paris , you’d have laughed . So , it’s important for me to keep up , keep the question of doping and drug use from becoming banal and being turned into various shades of gray . </s>
The issue of cheating is not gray , it’s black and it’s white . Drug use may not affect fan interest , but it should , and that 's our failure as fans , compounding the failure of drug-using players in the leagues . Please finish up . Are these really our personal values , that dangerous cheating is what we stand for ? Bishop , let me finish with Bishop Fulton Sheen , he had a great thing . </s>
He said , if it’s wrong , it’s wrong . Even if everybody is doing it . And if it’s right it’s right , even if nobody’s doing it . </s>
Our thanks to Dick Pound , and uh , I indicate no disapproval of the opinions about to be expressed by Radley Balko when I note that he is ironically named to be on themselves panel . Radley , Radley Balko , for the motion that performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports should be accepted . Well , let me start by saying , for those of you who might be confused , I am not Ben Johnson . On the train ride from DC this morning , we passed through Baltimore . Doing so reminded me of one of my favorite authors , Baltimore native H.L . Mencken , who I think would have had a good laugh at the hypocrisy , the posturing , the uh , moral prudery that’s associated with this steroid controversy . </s>
Eighty years ago Mencken aptly summarized this debate when he wrote , quote , “The urge to save humanity is almost always a false face for the urge to rule it.” So why are we here tonight ? Is this about saving sport , or is this about some people imposing their view about what sport should be ? If we’re here to talk about fairness in competition , I 'm dubious . Take representative Tom Davis , one of the more cam- , camera hungry politicians to demagogue this issue . </s>
After the 2000 census , Representative Davis maneuvered to have his Congressional District gerrymandered to include as many Republicans as possible , ensuring his continual reelection , eliminating the real number of options for his constituents to vote . He ran the next year unopposed . </s>
Davis also snuck a , a provision into an unrelated piece of Federal legislation preventing an apartment complex from going up in his district because , he told the Washington Post , he feared it would bring too many Democrats into the district . This guy is cheating at Democracy , and he’s lecturing baseball players about fairness . If we want to talk about the health risks of professional sports , we might discuss the ballooning weight of NFL lineman over the last twenty years , or the corresponding life , drop in life expectancy that’s come with it . </s>
Or you might talk about the particularly hellish world of thoroughbred horse racing jockeys , who subject themselves to sweat boxes , diuretics , suppositories , and intentional eating disorders . In fact , any world class athlete subjects his body to stresses it wasn’t really designed to endure . And as we’ve seen with government bans on consensual activity , from alcohol to gambling to cocaine to prostitution , prohibitions not only don’t work , they make the activity in question more dangerous by pushing it underground . So what about the children ? </s>
Survey data actually shows that teen steroid use has mirrored the use of other elicit drugs over the years . It went up mildly in the 1990’s , and has since either dropped off slightly , or leveled off since 2000 . It’s likely that the same trends that govern cocaine or marijuana use govern teen steroid use far more than what’s happening in the sports pages . </s>
In fact , a study released last year , and one of the few studies to actually attempt to find out what motivates teen boys to take steroids , found that the most reliable indicator of steroid use was a teen’s own self , self esteem and body image . The suggestion , and I think we can all agree it’s pretty intuitive , is that teenage boys who do take steroids do so not because they want to look like Barry Bonds or Mark McGwire , but because they want to look good for teenage girls . So what is this debate really all about ? </s>
I’d suggest it’s about paternalism , and it’s about control . </s>
We have a full blown moral panic on our hands here , and it’s over a set of substances that , for whatever reason , has attracted the ire of the people who have made it their job to tell us what is and is n't good for us . Our society has an oddly schizophrenic relationship with pharmaceuticals and medical technology . </s>
If something could be said to be natural , we tend to be OK with it . </s>
If it’s lab made or synthetic , we tend to be leery . But even synthetic drugs and man-made technology seem to be OK if the aim is to make sick people better , or broken people whole again . And so when we talk about expanding or transcending what we consider to be normal , uh , then a certain uneasiness starts to set in . </s>
There was an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education last month about university professors taking stimulants like Adderall to increase their academic productivity . Oddly , the article quoted , quoted several professors who considered this cheating at academics . I have to confess , I really don’t understand this way of thinking . Academics is the search for truth and knowledge , if a drug can make that search more productive with few side effects , why in the world would n't you take it ? </s>
It’s also important to note that what we consider completely natural and acceptable today was quite out of the ordinary not too long ago . A hundred years ago life expectancy in the US was fifty , today it’s seventy-eight . Thanks to technology , medicine , and pharmaceutical , we’re today taller , stronger , faster , healthier , and expecting to live longer than ever before . </s>
Genetically advanced agriculture , anti-aging technology , and other advancements we’ve yet to see today will likely push our longevity even farther . </s>
It’s an old cliché that sports is a metaphor for the human condition , but there’s a lot of truth to that . As technology helped humanity obliterate a lot of these milestones , and helped us move beyond what , until a hundred years ago , had been a long , bleak history , similar advances over the years in nutrition , training , and using technology to improve technique have enabled sports records to fall with astonishing regularity . Sports is about exploring and stretching the lengths of human potential . Going back to even the pre-modern Olympics , when athletes ate live bees , and ate crushed sheep testicles to get a leg up on the competition , uh , sports has never been about physical ability alone . It’s been , been about ingenuity , innovation , and knowledge about what makes us faster and stronger , and avoiding what might do us harm . </s>
It’s always been part of the game . </s>
It should n't be surprising , then , that many of the biggest proponents of banning performance enhancing drugs in sports are also suspect of some of these continued advancements in human achievement . Leon Kass , former , formerly President Bush’s top advisor on bio-ethics , this is the same Mr. Kass who champions rigorous sports testing , has also spent much of his career actually lamenting the fact that human beings are living longer than ever before . </s>
He considers this contrary to some odd concept of natural order . Uh , of course there have been luddites and naturalists like Mr. Kass standing athwart the tide— One minute . …of human progress for much of human history . The essence of the agreement today I think is what people like Mr. Kass and some of our opponents tonight , they have a decidedly different definition of what’s pure , natural , and human than what I do . </s>
I think the difference is that I 'm sort of willing to take a live and let live approach and let everyone sort of explore their own boundaries and their own potential . </s>
Um , whereas I think some of our opponents are more interested in opposing their view of what is natural and what is , uh , human on everyone else , which of course brings us back to Mencken . I think , uh , our opponents want to legislate away what they believe are bad decisions , and if a free society means anything , it means we should be able to make all decisions , including the bad ones . Thank you . Radley Balko , thank you . And now speaking against the motion , Dale Murphy . </s>
To , to accept this motion would simply set us back . Accurately just mentioned , studies , recent studies are showing that young athletes and high school kids are , are using performance enhancing drugs to a lesser degree . To legitimize , um , the performance enhancing drugs in sports I feel would send the wrong message to young athletes . There are certainly legitimate uses for human growth hormone and steroids , um , as , as we all know . </s>
That’s why they’re a controlled substance under a doctor’s orders . But to hit a baseball further , or to run a hundred yard dash faster is not the reason and the legitimate use of these , uh , of these drugs . Um , Dr. Fost mentioned that at one point in time there were six percent that were using , um , performance enhancing drugs in the major leagues . </s>
It really makes my point exactly . Ninety-four percent of the guys were not using , then that tells me that you don’t need these things to be the best athlete in the world , that there are plenty of legitimate ways to get bigger , stronger , and faster that everyone has access to , equal access to . Um , if accepted , what about those , for instance , in Major League Baseball , what about those who do not want to use it ? </s>
The playing field , then , once again , is , is not level . Um , the only way , someone said earlier , the only way you could probably make this work is that if you forced everybody to take performance enhancing drugs , which um , we all know would n't work . </s>
Um , people do not want to see , I would argue the point that people do not want to see performances , uh , based on , uh , false premises , that it is , it is their ability , athletically or psychologically or mentally , alone , um , that if it’s being enhanced people do not want , accept that . You mentioned Barry Bonds adding , um , seats , um , fans in the seats every game he played . </s>
I would have to say that in San Francisco he was , um , generally accepted , but everywhere else he went , I think those ten thousand extra went there to jeer him and his accomplishments . After the season , after all this has come out with Mark McGwire , I think most of us look back now and say we got caught up in something that we really did n't want to support . If there was no alternative , I could understand us giving into this problem . </s>
Certainly there are a lot of problems that young people have and society has . But this is one of them . If , uh , if there are a , a percentage of young athletes still taking performance enhancing drugs , to me it’s still a problem . Um , and if there was no answer to , uh , this problem I think I would understand giving in , and voting , uh , in favor of this motion . But I believe that there is a pro—there is an answer to the problem . </s>
And , uh , as was mentioned earlier we look at smoking in public . Uh , we— most of us grew up with that being totally acceptable and now it’s against the law , there’s truly been a culture change . There can be a change in culture in professional athletics , and I believe that it is starting . We need , uh , better testing , harsher punishments , and , and people will decide not to get involved with performance-enhancing drugs . </s>
Uh , gambling in baseball is the perfect example . </s>
Um , the culture of , uh , professional baseball players is the one thing they know , and , and one thing they learn from the minute they sign a professional contract , is that if you gamble on the game in any way , shape or form , your career will be over . Uh , my understanding is , uh , I don’t have any statistics to show this , but once one of the greatest hitters , uh , is kicked out of the game because he gambled on the sport , that reinforced the culture in baseball that you don’t gamble on baseball . I believe we can change the culture , and to accept this motion , really would set us back with the progress that we have made . After tonight , I think you will see—you will feel , uh , as you listen closely , that , you feel as I do , that there is no sustainable , logical , reasonable , um , uh… reason , for these things to be accepted . If you put any of these , uh , alleg—these , uh , positions under scrutiny , I think you will all come to understand , that we simply do not need this in sports at any level . </s>
Let alone the high school kids that see professional athletes and are tempted to use them . If you put an age limit on use , you’re still gon na have abuse at the younger ages . To me it’d be much better…to change the culture and the idea and the thinking about competing in sports . </s>
And we are making progress , and studies have shown that . Certainly we don’t want all of our athletes to look like the American Gladi—Gladiators or professional wrestlers . Um…if , if that’s what we want , with all of our ath—athletes , um , then I can understand that but I don’t think that’s what the public wants . As far as baseball is concerned , certainly people like the long ball . Um , but , uh , this , this past year was , in the la—in the last 10 years , this past year , had the seventh fewest home runs of the last decade , and yet we broke records again with attendance . </s>
Attendance is good , home runs do not have to be up . People love the game , they appreciate the game , they appreciate finesse . Um , again , we don’t all want to look like professional wrestlers out there and I don’t think that’s what the fans want . Um…uh…I think the , uh , um…the thing too you need to be careful about is drawing , uh , as— </s>
One minute— </s>
—as was mentioned earlier is drawing , um , the opposing side , drawing , drawing analogies and conclusions , with things that really are not , uh , are not comparable . For instance— um , um , comparing , uh , anabolic steroids or performance-enhancing drugs to the Greeks wearing tennis shoes . Or to the ancient Greek athletes , uh , eating bees . This is not what we’re talking about and that is not—to me does not compare , what we’re talking about , is drugs that are a controlled substance that have very many good , legitimate uses . As was mentioned over a million kids take human growth hormone , they don’t take human growth hormone without exhaustive studies to make sure that they are not already producing enough on their own . </s>
When kids abuse these drugs , and athletes abuse these drugs , I don’t think there’s any question that we know , uh , that there are side effects . And some of ‘em we do not know now . </s>
Wrap up— Especially with our use . What concerns me is the example that the athletes at the highest level set for our youth . </s>
I feel like we’re making progress and a vote in favor of this motion would , would , uh , be definitely a step backward , backward , in our efforts to , uh , correct this problem . </s>
Thank you . Dale Murphy , thank you . Now as the format indicates before we hear from Julian and from George , I’ll direct , uh , a question of my own toward either side of the debate . Dick Pound , you have stated that there are obvious health risks to the use of performance-enhancing drugs , steroids in particular . </s>
Are those health risks truly obvious . I—I think they are too anybody who’s , who’s studied these , uh , issues , and , and I think it—they’re obvious to , uh , the folks that have had to deal with , uh , badly damaged or dead athletes . If you take cycling as an example they , there , there’ve been dozens and dozens and dozens of , of , of young men who’ve had heart attacks . They’ve had heart attacks because their hearts can’t pump the sludge that their blood has become , uh , as a result of EPO . </s>
Doctor— </s>
So yes , there are real dangers— </s>
Dr. Fost points out that , there have been more players killed , one at the major league level and many at the amateur level , playing baseball , than have been killed because of steroid use as baseball players . And many more killed or seriously injured playing football , which is incidental to playing the sport , than…we’re able to determine have suffered serious health consequences because of steroid use , how would you respond to that ? Yes— Me still ? I—I would say that the , part of the difficulty with this is , is collecting data , both his and , and other data , because , for many years , all of this use has been clandestine , and hidden . </s>
And so you don’t have the , the , the , the data that are , uh , as accurate or as complete as you’d like . Radley Balko , uh , you are advocating a live-and-let-live approach to this . Isn’t it a reasonable response to that to say , fine , that’s one argument for a different day about society in general . </s>
But all sports have rules which regulate the competition . No one can stop me in my back yard from using an aluminum bat if I wan na play a game of my own . But they can in a major league game . Cork and saliva are perfectly natural and legal substances but not in the context of major league baseball . </s>
So why are these— why are these things analogous . Well , I—I agree , um , I think we’re—what we’re debating tonight is what the rules ought to be , um , I’m not advocating , uh , uh , I’m not defending the people who have been caught cheating , I think , uh , I think Mr . Pound is right , when you enter into a league and you agree to , to compete , uh , you agree to a predetermined set of rules . </s>
Um , but I think tonight what we’re trying to determine is , is what those rules ought to be . Um , and I think that , you know , I think that athletes , uh , care about their bodies and they care about their , their earning potential . </s>
Uh , they care about the next season , and I think they are going to seek out a competitive advantage , but they’re not going to do so to the point where , they jeopardize future earning potential or they jeopardize the next season . I think , I think people , uh , have , I think athletes have a little bit , uh , more respect for their bodies than that . </s>
Although you’re probably aware that there have been surveys of Olympic athletes who have been asked the question , if it would guarantee a gold medal , would you reduce your life expectancy by 20 years to get it . You’re dealing with people who are in their late teens to…early twenties in many cases , they have a certain sense of vulnerability , a reduced lifespan from 80 to 60 may seem somewhere in the distant future . A huge percentage of them answer yes . Well , I mean and if , if the , you know , US Olympic Committee wants to , to , uh , set those rules , uh , you know , I , I , I think there are important distinctions to be drawn , uh , uh , between amateur athletics and professional athletics but , uh , you know , I—I think , uh , a couple ones , I think… First of all I think , private leagues and private sports , uh , professional sports organizations should be able to set their own rules , I’m not advocating , uh , that Congress mandate to the , the NFL that they have to allow performance-enhancing drugs . Uh , but I also think , don’t think that it’s any business of Congress telling leagues that they’re— they have to ban them as well , uh , I think that , uh , uh , the league should be able to set their own rules and I think the people will , uh , athletes will , will , uh…lobby to get the rules that both reflect their desire to get a competitive advantage but also protect their health . </s>
All right , now let’s , uh , return to the formal presentations , and , uh…presenting his viewpoint for the motion , Julian Savulescu . The finest , uh , Italian cyclist , Fausto Coppi was once asked , and winner of the Tour de France was once asked , uh…how often had he taken la bamba , or amphetamines during his career , he said , only when absolutely necessary . And when asked precisely how often that was he said , almost always . Another Tour de France , Jacques Anquetil in a debate with a French politician said , what do you expect us to do , ride the tour on mineral water ? Where our team agrees with , uh , Dick Pound and , and , uh , the opposition is that this is really only the tip of the iceberg . </s>
The war on drugs has failed , drugs have always been present in sport , and we’re only seeing probably less than 5 percent of the drug-takers being caught . Not only has it failed , it must fail . Growth hormone is extremely difficult to detect , blood doping is also extremely difficult to detect , and in the future we’ll have gene doping . </s>
Insulin-like growth factor can be injected into muscles , to improve muscular strength , it would have to be detected with a muscle biopsy . Uh , science has created super- mice capable of running six , uh , kilometers instead of 200 meters , by altering their glucose metabolism . They’ve created Schwarzenegger mice with vastly stronger muscles and marathon mice capable of running much faster marathons , these could all be done in humans . We will not be able to detect these changes . </s>
Not only is the war on drugs bound to fail , uh , it also has other adverse effects , it reduces interest , this year , uh , in the Tour de France the race leader Michael Rasmussen , was , uh , sacked by his team on allegations of taking drugs . </s>
There’s always a cloud over winners , of whether they’re taking drugs or not . It’s unfair , the honest athletes are penalized because they’re denied access to safe performance enhancers and of course the rich can buy the undetectable enhancers . They can buy hypoxic air tents for 7000 US dollars which are legal , whereas EPO , which is banned , costs only 120 US dollars a month . </s>
But most of all it’s unsafe . What happens is there’s pressure to develop undetectable performance enhancers with no eye to the safety . </s>
The BALCO scandal illustrates what a back yard situation we have at the moment . </s>
What is policy and the current zero-tolerance approach to drugs in sport , is inconsistent and confused . External technologies like hypoxic air tents , or altitude training , are acceptable , they raise the red blood cell level , yet if we do this directly by retransfusing our own blood , blood doping , or using EPO , a natural hormone , that’s illegal . Yet they all have exactly the same effect . Some enhancers have been permitted in sport . </s>
Caffeine increases the time to exhaustion , or reduces the time , uh , increases the time to exhaustion by 20 percent . It used to be illegal , athletes were stripped of their medals for taking caffeine , it’s now legal , and it hasn’t corrupted the spirit of sport , it hasn’t had the effect of creating violent mutant gladiators , as the opposition has suggested . </s>
Creatine also increase the time to exhaustion by 10 percent , it’s also legal . Tour de France riders use intravenous nutrition to give them enough calories , uh , overnight , and of course Tiger Woods has used lasik eye surgery to give him better than 20/20 vision . None of these have had adverse effect on sport . One of the major arguments is that it’s against the spirit and integrity of sport , Dick Pound wrote—raised this issue . </s>
When Dick Pound was asked in an interview with the New York Times which performance enhancements he thought were against the spirit of sport he said , it’s like pornography . You know it when you see it . Well of course D.H. Lawrence’s novels were thought to be pornographic a century ago , they’re not now . </s>
Professional classical musicians regularly take beta blockers to reduce , trim and enhance their performance . The music sounds good , it’s not against the spirit of music . The spirit of sport is entailed in what sport is , it’s the display of human physical excellence . Indeed , just as we can increase the artistic expression through the use of beta blockers to enhance musical performance we could use them to enhance performance in archery , or indeed , in many , uh , sports requiring control of anxiety . </s>
Ben Johnson famously said , the human body was not meant to run at the speeds it’s asked to run today . To recover from the grueling training necessary to run those times you need steroids to increa—increase recovery . And of course , Tiger Woods has used lasik eye surgery , and that hasn’t been seen to compromise the spirit of golf . To say that we should reduce…drugs in sport or eliminate them because they increase performance , is simply like saying that we should eliminate alcohol from parties because it increases sociability . So our proposal , is that we allow a modest approach . </s>
We allow performance enhancers which are safe , and consistent with the risks that athletes already entail . You’ll notice that Dick Bou— Dick Pound has had to reel out examples from the ‘60s of deaths from steroids , when they were taken orally . And indeed the blood doping deaths all occurred in the ‘90s before the International Cycling Union set a maximum hem—hematocrit of 50 percent . No athlete today is dying in competition from taking EPO . </s>
Indeed I would prefer to take growth hormone prescribed by a doctor , than compete in professional American football , because I know of no ventilator-dependent quadriplegic caused by taking growth hormone . </s>
The drugs need to be consistent with the spirit of an activity , creating webbed hands and feet , which is possible , which is possible , would compromise the spirit of spearing— swimming . </s>
But allowing athletes to recover from injuries consistent of sport . We should set limits , as the International Cycling Union has done , on the hermatocrit…and test health , not test for drugs . </s>
It makes no difference whether an athlete’s hermatocrit goes from 46 to 48 percent , by altitude training or by taking EPO or blood doping . It’s a waste of time trying to detect— One minute . Drugs in sport , far from being against the sport , embodies the human spirit . We are not horses or dogs , flogged to display our maximum biological potential , the spirit of being human , is to make choices . </s>
To be human is to be better . To make , to make choices , and performance enhancement as we’ve argued per se is not against the spirit of sport , it embodies the history and spirit of sport . It’s true that cheating is ruining sport . But there are two ways to reduce cheating . </s>
One is to ramp up the war on drugs which is bound to fail , the other is to change the rule , the rules to allow regulated , supervised access . We agree that you should hear—adhere to the rules . But the rules will provide a better spectacle , protect the athlete’s health , narrow the gap between the cheaters and the honest athletes , if we allow access to safe performance enhancers . One of the greatest advantages of allowing , uh , the , the access— Please wrap up . </s>
—the access to performance enhancement is the , the limited funds that are used by what are $ 22 million , could be better devoted to detecting those drugs which are seriously against athletes’ health , rather than wasting time on substances that do not harm their health , and are actually already a part of the sport . Thank you . Julian Savulescu , thank you , and now our sixth and final debater , speaking against the motion , George Michael , George . Don’t start my timer . </s>
He’s from St. Louis , he’s a Cardinal fan like me . Bob , I have embroidered Mark McGwire’s 70 home run single-season T-shirts , $ 39 , do you have any ? </s>
Do you wear ‘em ? Uh , they’d be too big for me . I got ta give mine away , it kills me that he had to be on anabolic steroids but that’s another story , the reason I’m here tonight , is that I’ve talked to a lot of these athletes , I’ve spent the last…I guess since I first talked to Rich Pound almost , almost six weeks talking to athletes…and trainers , and they all say the same thing . </s>
Don’t use my name . Don’t use my name . So I’ll avoid the names but there are a couple things we need to know . </s>
Number one , the rules of the game say that steroids and for good reason , performance-enhancing drugs are absolutely illegal . Cheating is cheating and you can’t change it , you can do it any way you want with any documentary but you can’t change it . Steroids however you have to know this . </s>
They will make you faster , they will make you stronger , and they make help you look and feel and be younger . That’s a lot of attraction . Steroids will make you wealthy . </s>
Steroids will make you famous . Steroids will help you get success and if you don’t believe it , look at some of the guys that hold the records . During the course of my preparation I talked to a Hall of Famer . I said let me ask you something . I said with the steroids , you didn’t have ‘em when you were playing . </s>
What if there were steroids now . And he said if it got me back on the field , regardless of the penalty , I’d do it . I thought man , Hall of Famer , you wan na play—he said you don’t know what it’s like , not to be able to excel at the game anymore . Said steroids are the greatest attraction , it’s like walking on the beach with no one around , you and a beautiful girl . You know what’s gon na happen . </s>
Said , well . </s>
I had to tell my wife , I can’t talk about that one . However…even though there is no clinical proof , let me repeat , there is no clinical proof that steroids directly lead to death , there are certain guys have suffered something , now , Lyle Alzado was mentioned . Lyle Alzado is— as—Alzado is not a name to me . I knew him , I interviewed him , I liked him . Thought he was crazy , but that’s why we got along . </s>
Lyle Alzado…this is what’s not commonly discussed , when he was a freshman in college , weighed 190 pounds . When he graduated as a senior and he started steroids in 1969 as a freshman . When he graduated it was 300-pound muscle mass . That’s a gain of 110 pounds , and you knew he was going big in the NFL draft . </s>
Went on to become the NFL Defensive Player of the Year in 1977 . Couple of weeks before he died he said , damn , if I’d never done steroids and human growth hormone , I wouldn’t be dying today . He died , at the age of 43 . 43 years old . Ken Caminiti . </s>
He’s a third baseman for the Padres , it’s spring of 1996 . He’s chasing a fly ball , he goes out , he dives . He tears his rotator cuff . </s>
Ken Caminiti was a good guy , a tough guy , a bull of a guy . He said I got ta get well , so he played even though he was in great pain . Said Ken . Go down to Tijuana , get you some anabolic steroids , you’ll be back on the field better than ever . </s>
So he did . In the year 1996 when he got hooked on steroids and didn’t just do cycles , but did double cycles , so don’t tell me we’re gon na monitor it . Ain’t nobody gon na monitor it . He used so much steroids , that he became a giant of a man , he was bulging , Ken Caminiti went from hitting .282 , to hitting .330 . </s>
He went from 23 home runs to 40 home runs , he had 130 RBI’s , he made millions on a free-agent contract , and , he was absolutely hooked , he said , the more I used the more I had to use , because if I didn’t use I felt like I was going on the field naked . Nobody wants to walk out on a field naked . </s>
But that’s how he felt . ‘Cause he said , I was hooked . He was the MVP of baseball in 1996 . </s>
Eight years later he was dead , at the age of 40 . But , there’s no clinical proof that steroids led to his death . Even though , he was an ala—anabolic steroid type free . If any of you are Yankee fans , think back to 1999 . </s>
The Yankees win the World Series . They have a relief pitcher you may or may not have heard of named Dan Naulty . You ever heard of him , Bob ? Yes . Dan Naulty pitched for the Twins then became with the Yanks . </s>
Now follow this , in 1992 Don Naulty was six foot eight , he’s a strapping right-hander , he weighs only 165 pounds . Guy said to him , Don , you got ta get on some steroids , man , you put some body on you . So he did . </s>
In 1999 he was with the Yankees , he weighed 245 pounds . That’s a weight gain of 60 pounds . And it was all muscle . Unfortunately he described himself as being suicidal , he said , “I was absolutely nutso.” </s>
Now he didn’t die , he survived . But he had to have major surgery because his veins were clotted against his arteries . He had to have major surgery because he tore the muscle right off—the , the muscle and the groin completely off the bone . Dr. James Andrews , a man I consider to be one of the foremost absolutely best surgeons of all . He said—he’s a north—noted orthopedic surgeon , he said that…now check this out . </s>
That in 2002 , 17 percent…17 percent of total baseball payroll went to guys who were on the injured list with muscle tears , muscle strains , ruptured Achilles tendon , and on goes the list . He said that we have had a 200 percent increase in just the five years prior to 2002 . Baseball owners paid $ 370 million to players who were not able to play . Most of them accord9ing to Dr. Andrews , were related to their use of anabolic steroids . </s>
And you now wan na admit—legalize it , and govern it ? No definitive clinical proof though , that it was the result of steroids . </s>
No proof . I’m probably the only guy in the room who is friends with professional wrestlers , I started in 1980 with Bob Backlund . I’ve MC’d a lot of their events , I’ve enjoyed ‘em , I love ‘em . </s>
Guys that are just names to you like Hulk Hogan , Ricky Steamboat , Nature Boy , Rick Flair , these are all friends of mine . I wanted to call and check with some of the wrestlers— One minute— —I used to know , how they’re doing today . </s>
How’d they recover after the use of steroids . </s>
I went to call ‘em and you know what I found ? Of the wrestlers who were professional stars , 40 were dead by the age of 40 . 70 were dead by the age of 50 . But there’s no clinical proof that they died of steroid abuse even though they all used steroids . Here’s the bottom line . </s>
I am not willing to pay the price for legalizing steroids and performance-enhancing drugs , ‘cause I’ve seen too often what it can do . I don’t wan na go to the cemetery and tell all the athletes who are dead there , hey guys , soon you’ll have a lot more of your friends coming , because we’re gon na legalize this stuff . The only good news out of it ? </s>
They wouldn’t hear the news . </s>
Because they’re all dead . Thank you . Our thanks to George Michael , and again , according to the format I’ll pose a question to each side of the table . Dr. Fost , if there were unfettered access to performance-enhancing drugs , isn’t it reasonable to posit that , even now , or even during the so-called steroid era , there were some constraints , some fear of being , uh , caught , there were some tests , however flawed— But if it’s all wide open , it would go beyond any levels we’ve seen heretofore , and could possibly , get into an area where not only would the competition be grotesque , but where there would be real and verifiable health risks . Nobody knows but my guess is it would be exactly the opposite . </s>
Why . Because if athletes could go to doctors and get drugs without having to go to Mexico or to BALCO Labs , they could A , get drugs which had been studied and tested and approved by the FDA , they’d know what they were taking . They could get drugs that would be manufactured in an American manufacturing facility with oversight by the FDA , and they’d be getting advice from doctors on which drugs were safe and effe— effective , which now they can’t find out even if they want to because the stuff comes from Mexico . </s>
All right , suppose we were to adopt Julian’s suggestion , that there were regulated , permissible regulated use of performance- enhancing drugs , and in each case it was appropriate to the spirit of the particular sport , that’s fine in the ideal . But it’s naïve to believe that each competitor , many of them obsessed with victory and believing in the full bloom of youth that they’re invulnerable , would stay within those limits , once there were unfettered access , they could just take as much as they wanted to gain whatever short-term competitive advantage they wanted , couldn’t they ? Uh , whatever a doctor would prescribe to them and probably some would go outside the system as they do now— Well couldn’t they get more than the doctor prescribed , people do that all the time now with HGH , there’s a certain amount you can prescribe plausibly for certain conditions , even for anti-aging purpose , and people just double it , triple it , quadruple it , to whatever level they want , right ? </s>
Yeah , that’s what they’re doing now , the difference is that you’d have drugs which could be tested , you’d have follow-up studies so that they would know what the facts are . You’d know whether any of these deaths that George Michael refers to have anything to do with steroids . As he said , there’s no evidence that they do . But there are other adverse effects of steroids that I would worry about , but we’ll never find out about them , because we ca n't study them . </s>
So , I think athletes might be more constrained from using them if there was more data out there that they could know about . </s>
Anybody else on this side of the table want to add anything to that , or respond ? Can I ? Julian . So what , if this is the honest athlete , and this is the cheater , at the moment the cheater has a significant advantage . </s>
Part of this will be heard on radio . So Julian is holding his left arm at a certain level and his right arm above it . </s>
So , so what will happen if you allow access to safe performance enhancers is the honest athletes will come up , but of course the cheaters will still take , as you suggest , an advantage in the black market . But what you will be doing is narrowing the advantage that the cheater has , because now there’s a market for safe performance enhancement . So you’ve made the honest athletes better off by bringing them closer to the cheaters without compromising their health . </s>
That 's the reason why you want to create a market for safe performance enhancers . So growth hormone , we heard all this discussion about steroids , growth hormone is a very safe substance . Now , you may be able to achieve a lot of the benefits that you can achieve with steroids by using growth , growth hormone . And you’ll be developing new substances that will be competitors for , at the moment , the stuff that , that is simply on the black market . George ? </s>
Julian . </s>
Would you hear what you just said ! If I don’t want to do drugs , I ca n't play against you . If you don’t want to take the risks of a spinal cord injury , you ca n't play professional football . No , come on , say with the drugs— </s>
No , no , no— George , George , there’s a , for three years in the NFL there’s a ninety percent chance of permanent disability . If you want to play in the NFL , that’s what you buy into . </s>
People choose to do it… How do you , how do you define permanent disability ? </s>
I 'm talking about anabolic steroids . I 'm talking about… …there’s a ninety percent chance of permanent disability . People make that choice . </s>
You want to , you want to ban professional football because— </s>
No , but you play within the rules , and if you get hurt , as Bob says , that’s an unfortunate accident . </s>
But the reason you want these rules is because you 're concerned about the health and safety of the athletes . </s>
Why are n't you against football ? A question that can be posed later in the debate when the format actually calls for direct questions from either side of the table . Here , one more question to this side , and then we’ll announce the results of the preliminary voting by the audience . </s>
I’ll pose it to Dick Pound , but again , Dale and George can respond as well . Dick , after all your years with the Olympics and with WADA , are you troubled by the fact that despite best efforts , the penalties are almost by definition disproportionate ? You catch a handful , and we can reasonably assume that a larger group goes free . </s>
Marion Jones was never caught by Olympic testing , sophisticated as it was . She was caught by the legal system . </s>
And the same year that Ben Johnson was caught , others had statistical anomalies in their performances , and for whatever reason , they were not caught . Does that trouble you ? Oh , sure it does , of course it does . Any time you see somebody who’s cheated and gets away with it , that 's very troubling . It’s one of the reasons why , why in WADA we devote , I think it’s about twenty-five percent of our entire budget to scientific research , so we can , we can find EPO , we can find HGH , we can find , uh , evidence of blood transfusions . </s>
And we’re developing a test that is not a muscle biopsy , for genetic manipulation . We’re getting a screening test that I think will be able to detect the stuff very unobtrusively by the time it comes on . So yes it , of course it bothers us , but you don’t , you don’t go in the direction Julian’s suggesting , which is , you pick the lowest common denominator , help the guys who want to play honestly catch up with the cheaters , instead of bringing the cheaters back down to where , what they promised to do , which is not to use these things . </s>
I think it’s a complete reversal of responsibility and approach . Dale ? George ? </s>
Anything to add ? Yeah , I was , I was going to say , as I said earlier , if , if I didn’t think we were making progress , and that this is a winnable battle , however long it takes , um , then I would understand giving in . </s>
But I , I ca n't , I ca n't comprehend just giving up . Um , those who are against smoking in public have stayed with it , have stayed with it , and have stayed with it . </s>
And it has worked . And we can change culture , we can change the way people feel about things . And , and this is a battle about fighting , instead of just giving in . </s>
Here , here’s a reason to think this battle is unwinnable . Given the massive prize money , and the incentives to cheat , and the low probability of being detected , you can win the battle if you reduce the prize money , but that’s not going to happen . </s>
All you can , unrealistically , increase the detection rates , but you 're not going to achieve that either . The economic models all push this into a prisoner’s dilemma where people irresistibly will cheat given the incentives that are on offer , and the probability to— How many , how many rich canoeists do you know ? I 'm sorry ? </s>
How many rich canoeists do you know ? </s>
Who many rich canoeists do you know ? </s>
It’s not , it’s not— </s>
It’s just money , I agree that it’s— There’s a whole array of , a whole array of Olympic sports , obviously that have little or not financial reward attached to them . </s>
Mr. Balko , let me , let me make one quick point . You took , took on the horse industry , I’ve been named the top American Paint Horse Breeder , and the American Quarterhorse Breeder twice . So , I’ve had a lot of horses in my barn , a hundred and fifty at a time . We’ve never used a sweat box . </s>
Ever . I will not allow steroids . Ever . </s>
When you talk about the horse industry , and you know how we get horses ready for shows or race , make it real general that some people do , because I would never do it . All right , we’re going far afield here , so— </s>
So what ? Briefly— It involves steroids . Briefly Radley , and then I’ll try and get back to the format . Go ahead . </s>
I was referring to , there was a cover story on Sports , in cover , Sports Illustrated a couple of years ago about the lengths that jockeys go through to , to make weight . Oh , the jockeys , OK . Right , the jockeys , not the horses . OK . You want to get back to your format ? </s>
Yeah , we have to get back to the format because , uh , they , they threaten me with draconian punishments if I , uh , went too far afield . So , what we do at this point , before opening it up to , uh , some back and forth between the panelists , and then ultimately to a long session of Q & A , most of it from the audience , we let you know the results of the initial balloting . Now , this is before any of the debaters took to the podium , the proposition is , we should accept performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports . Before the debate began eighteen percent of you were for the motion , sixty-three percent were against , nineteen percent were undecided . You’ll have a chance to vote again after the debate has concluded , and we’ll see if those numbers move in one direction or the other . </s>
Now we’ll allow the panelists to question each other directly . </s>
Norm Fost will go first , and you can ask a direct question of any panelist on the other side of the table . I 'm going to try to squeeze in two , two questions , if I can . Uh , I want to ask Dale Murphy a question . Andy Petitte , the Yankee pitcher who recently , he was named in the Mitchell Report , and he admitted to using , um , growth hormone . </s>
And he said the reason I used it was because I had injuries , the my doctor said my injuries could heal faster , um , which is true , that’s the way these things work , they let you to repair injuries faster so you can train harder and get back on the field . </s>
If Roger Clemens said that , if Ben Johnson said that , if they all said that , which they equally could have said , I used them because they help me heal faster , would that have been , are you OK with what Petitte said , and would you be OK with them ? And I want to ask— Let’s , let’s let him ask , answer that first , then you ask your second question . Dale ? Yeah , absolutely not , it’s , it’s still trying to get an advantage over the guys that are not taking human growth hormone to recover from an injury . </s>
That’s why guys take steroids . It’s not necessarily to look like Barry Bonds , but it’s to recover quicker . Pitchers , that’s why pitchers take them . Um , so I think in answer to your question , it would not be as big a story . </s>
Andy Petitte was smart . But is it still right ? No . It’s still not within the rules and the spirit of the game to take steroids or human growth hormone to recover from an injury quicker , because a lot of guys are following the rules , and they don’t get to recover faster because they , they kept the rules . </s>
So it’s still wrong . I think he had a good P.R . agent and lawyer to say this is how you get it off your back . It does n't make it right . But , but we’re talking about what the rules should be , and , and I 'm interested , as a former player , of your opinion , if , if it’s true , that the side effects of HGH are minimal , particularly when compared to steroids , and it does help , I mean , these are people , athletes are people whose livelihoods depends on , on basically what amounts to physical labor , right ? </s>
And if a guy can , uh , get back into the game quicker because of HGH , is that any different than a , you know , a construction worker who wants to get back on the job quicker because his pay check is dependent on it , taking something , a drug that has minimal effects that helps him recover quicker ? Reasonable question , let me focus it a little bit . </s>
Um , are we in a pass/fail mindset about the whole array of performance enhancing drugs , especially after the Mitchell Report , if we talk about baseball , where if you 're in the Mitchell Report , you 're guilty , no matter what you did , you 're as guilty as the most full blown juicer . And should even those who were generally against the use of performance enhancing drugs in competitive sports , should they consider that possibly we’ve lumped all these drugs and all the circumstances under which they might be used into the same grouping , and we might be able to take a more nuanced approached , and that maybe using HGH short term to help rehab an injury is not the same thing as going steroids full blown and going from a one hundred sixty pound whippet who hits twenty home runs to some sort of gargantuan figure who hits seventy- three ? Are you referring to Barry Bonds ? It was just a number . </s>
I retired , I retired— </s>
He hit seven sixty-two . I retired at , at thirty-seven , Barry Bonds hit seventy-three home runs at thirty-seven . </s>
Um , you know , what , what’s the future hold ? I mean , it , do , does it help you heal quicker ? </s>
Yeah , that 's why guys take them . </s>
But do we need them ? No . You 're going to heal a little slower . </s>
PANELIST Is n't that— </s>
I mean , you 're going to , let’s , let’s stop the abuse of a controlled substance . Human Growth Hormone for kids helps them grow when they 're not producing enough of their own . </s>
That 's a legitimate use for it . But for a , a pitcher to get back quicker , to me , in sports , you 're going to get back a little later . It’s OK . I want to stop the abuse . </s>
And I think to allow any of it in , for whatever reason , increases the odds of abuse , and increases , again , the kids seeing the example that they have to take this stuff to succeed . It just is n't needed . It’s not needed— In the , in the interests of time , Norm , quickly your second question . </s>
Well just first , as a doctor , I don’t understand what medicine’s about if it’s not about trying to help people recover from injuries and heal , and if you're— But not to hit home runs . And if you have a , if you have a drug that does n't , has almost no side effects , and it helps people heal , I don’t know how it differs from anything else that— Your question . </s>
Second one , Dick Pound , um , a lot of the discussion here has been about fair competition . Um , knowing that Janet Evans used a greasy swimsuit that was not available to her opponents , did you speak out at the time against that ? Would you speak out against it now ? Do you think her medal should be taken back ? And if not , why not ? </s>
Dick ? I , I think you’ve got a , a completely bizarre perception of the difference between Ben Johnson and Janet Evans . I mean , Ben Johnson used a prohibited anabolic steroid . There was a rule against it . </s>
There was no rule about whether you could have nylon swimsuits or greasy swimsuits . Do you think it was fair ? I think it was , I don’t think it was , uh , I don’t think that’s the question here . Did she break… What if she practiced harder ? </s>
I mean , frankly , I , I greatly admire Janet Evans , I think she won the Olympics because she trained harder and was a better swimmer than everybody . I do n't think the swimsuit made any difference , and there’s been subsequent tests on all of these suits . </s>
And the International Swimming Federation said , wear whatever you want , it does not appreciably , if at all , effect performance . </s>
So I think you , you’ve got your , your priorities really mixed up on that question . Dick , you 're right back at the microphone , because it’s your turn in the running order here to pose a question to the other side . Well , I was struck by something that both , um , both Radley and , and Norman said talking about , uh , you know , having access to all of this , and coercive rules . </s>
I mean , coercive rules , you 're talking , you make it , you make it sound like it’s three guys at the IOC headquarters making up all these rules . The anti-doping rules are approved by two hundred plus companies , two hundred plus national Olympic committees , seventy-five or more international federations , athletes commissions from all over the world . It’s a consensus about what is right for sports . And , you know , maybe the question to you is how come all you guys with these fabulous ideas are n't able to persuade two hundred governments and two hundred national— </s>
Two whom specifically are you directing the question ? Well , I’ll address it to both , because the other is , not all of the athletes you 're talking about will have access to a Yale medical doctor . What about the athletes in Mexico ? </s>
In , in Bulgaria ? I mean , you— Norm , Radley— If you want , you want equal , you want equal playing fields , you 're not talking the same . Well , what about the athletes who have the funds to travel to Colorado Springs to train in high altitude versus low income athletes who might not ? </s>
Uh , you know , there , there are built-in advantages and disadvantages . I think actually making a , uh , a cheap , a relatively cheap drug that mimics that effect , like EPO , which is much , much cheaper than , you know , flying an athlete out to Colorado to , to train at high altitude , um , actually democratizes , uh , that effect . I don’t think it actually , uh , makes it more difficult , uh , to achieve parity . Once again , Radley , stay at the microphone , because it’s your turn to question the other side . </s>
Unless Norm , you wanted to have a quick response ? I just wanted , Dick keeps reminding us that these athletes broke the rules , as if we’re not all agreed about that . I did n't know the debate topic was , should athlete be allowed to break the rules . No is the answer . </s>
OK , that’s the end of that debate . </s>
The question is , why the rules are there . </s>
Why do we have a rule that prohibits a doctor from prescribing a drug that helps you heal that has no side effects ? Where did that come from ? I have n't heard an answer to that yet . </s>
Is n't it fair to ask whether you’ve limited the definition of why someone might use steroids ? It’s not so high-minded as , it helps you heal . Many of the people who undertook taking steroids had no problems . Their only problem was they wanted to run faster , grow bigger , hit more home runs . </s>
So , there’s no medical indication for that , it’s performance enhancing . </s>
That 's why we call them performance enhancing drugs . </s>
All athletes want to get back out there and work out and get back on the field as soon as possible . You make it sound like they 're all on the disabled list . Many of them were quite good to begin with , then they , they went from good to super human by using performance enhancing drugs . Yeah , what it , what it enables them to do is to train harder and to recover from injury quicker , and that’s why they get better . </s>
Yeah . I tell you what , I had an experience with medical ethicists a few years ago , and I , I posed a question after the panel . I said , listen , let’s say I 'm a track and field athlete . </s>
Call me Ben , not a real name . </s>
And I come to you , and I say , listen , I would like to win the Olympics in Seoul . I ca n't do this unless I use anabolic steroids . There’s nothing therapeutic about this . And I have to tell you that it’s totally contrary to the rules of the sport under which I compete . </s>
Would you prescribe the anabolic steroids ? And the entire panel of medical ethicists said , of course . And I said , what ! ? And they said , yeah . And I said , on what basis ? </s>
They said , the autonomy of the patient . Sounds like Radley . Sorry , I did n't hear what— The autonomy of the patient . No , I don’t think— </s>
That 's , that 's what they said . No , I don’t think , for the fifth time , I do n't think we should break rules , and I don’t think doctors or ethicists should encourage people to break rules . But uh , if an athlete came , well , I’ve said it , if , if Ben Johnson , somebody named Ben came to me and said , I 've got an injury , do you know anything that will help it heal , and it’s risk-less , and there’s no rule against it , um , I’d say , I ca n't think of any reason not to— And , and what if the person came to you and they did n't want to make up a story , as they might have to , and they said , I have no injury . And I train like a demon . </s>
But I’d like to have benefits on top of that , would you prescribe the steroids for them ? Well , first of all , I 'm , I 'm not in sports medicine for a reason , so I 'm , I 'm not into prescribing it . But uh , that athlete would misunderstand it if he thought he , the reason that stops athletes from working out , and why you ca n't lift weights eight hours a day and five days a week , is because you 're suffering recurring injury . They may not understand that . </s>
All they know is that they 're sore and they ca n't work out , and that limits their ability to improve their performance . So you believe the sole benefit of steroid use , we’re not talking about HDH , we’re talking about growth steroid use , is simply the ability to work out harder and recover from injury , that in and of themselves , they do not , on top of that , enhance performance and allow you to do something which you could not do , if for some reason you could work out that hard without steroids ? Bob , if you and I started taking steroids now , we’re not going to look like Dale Murphy anytime soon— </s>
Of course not— Or Barry Bonds . Uh— </s>
You , you ca n't , you ca n't win the Indy 500 in a Honda either , but if you have… But if you have Indy , if you have two Indy cars , and one gets auto fuel and the other gets rocket fuel , you might have a different outcome . </s>
As best we know , the , the main way they work is by enabling you to work out harder . Steroids without working out are not going to really change anything very much . They do increase your aggressiveness , which also makes you , helps you to work out harder , so they have a psychological effect . But I think it’s all tied to working out . All right , against the rules , I briefly became part of the debate— </s>
No ! I’ll slap myself on the hand and turn it over to Radley to ask a question of the other side . Sure , my , uh , question is directed at George . Um , let’s say for the sake of argument that the , the names that you mentioned during your presentation did die directly as a result of their using steroids . </s>
Uh , during alcohol prohibition people drank alcohol that was , uh , wood alcohol , uh , they drank alcohol that was , gin that was distilled in bathtubs , toxic , nasty , nasty stuff . The reason they drank is because safer , cheaper , um , better alternatives were n't available at the time . Uh , once prohibition ended , you know , nobody drinks bathtub gin anymore . Uh , nobody drinks wood alcohol anymore . </s>
Um , assuming that all these deaths were tied to steroids , all these deaths occurred during a period where steroids were illegal , and were still prohibited . So , they were prohibited its entire time , people were doing them anyway , why not lift that veil , let people who are going to do it anyway get steroids from , from a doctor , get steroids from more reputable distributors so they don’t have to go to Tijuana . Maybe it wasn’t steroids itself that killed them , maybe it was the fact that it was some black market steroids that they were n't being , um , advised by a reputable doctor . You 're absolutely correct , and maybe , you know , if they were controlled better , maybe Lyle Alzado would n't have died . </s>
Maybe Ken Caminiti , who got most of his from Tijuana , would n't have died . But what about the tight end I talked to a couple of weeks ago who admitted that he gained sixty pounds , this guy is only thirty-eight years old , gained sixty pounds , beat up his wife , went to his coach and said , coach help me , I 'm doing the juice , but God , I beat up so and so . I know these people . He did n't get his from Mexico . Now , I don’t know where he got them . </s>
But if , the , if you , if you allow one , if Bob can do steroids , if we’re playing side by side , he hits two thirty , I hit two thirty , we both move up to the next level . </s>
If he’s allowed to do juice , when I sit back to sitting on the bench in St. Louis , I’d have done juice . </s>
So that , so whether it’s legal or illegal is , is immaterial . If we make it legal the problem is only going to become worse . In relationship to alcohol , I don’t happen to drink , so I 'm not a good one to discuss it with . </s>
Well , I guess my point is , if we’re talking about the safety of athletes , is n't it better to have this all happening above ground and in the open air— </s>
No , it’s better to have it , if you use it , you 're out of baseball . It should be a very strong penalty . Nothing , Pete Rose , one thing about the , Dick made the point earlier , and Dale followed up , they know that if you gamble , you 're dead . So that’s the way it should be with steroids , unless the doctor says , you know what , I 'm going to go to the commissioner and say , Dale needs to have this , so he’ll be able to come back . Then I accept that . </s>
Dale , your question for the other side of the debate ? OK , um , Dr. Fost , you mentioned the increased , uh , intensity of workouts of those on steroids . Would you consider that “’Roid Rage ? ” “’Roid Rage” as I understand it refers to people who do criminal things , that is who assault people or— OK , but is “’Roid Rage , ” quote , unquote , without getting into the technicalities of what “’Roid Rage” means , is n't that one of the side effects of taking anabolic steroids ? </s>
You become more aggressive when you take steroids , and that is one part of why I think some athletes feel they can work out harder , they sort of get more aggressive . They , so is it psychological , or is it a brain chemistry thing ? </s>
It’s totally psychological ? I think there is a psychological effect , right , that impels them to train harder . So , when you increase the testosterone , and , and you increase your intensity , um , is n't that , that is a , an effect , you 're saying ? </s>
That , it will effect you that way ? Sure , sure . And also are you saying that HGH , the only thing it does is help you heal faster ? No , it has many— </s>
Do you think these guys , in other words , do you think guys took HGH for other reasons other than healing faster ? Well , they took it so they could get back on the field sooner , could body build better , could lift weights , could train more vigorously , all of which enhanced their muscle mass . That’s the ultimate goal , is to become stronger . OK . Decreases fat and , and increase muscle mass . </s>
Right . So , so the ability to recover faster and work out harder and gain muscle mass , steroids does help muscle mass product , productivity ? </s>
Combined with working out , yeah . And if I don’t want to do that , are you saying in the future , if the motion is accepted , that essentially , I am at a tremendously unfair advantage if I decide that I do not want to take this stuff ? I don’t know about tremendously unfair , I think that— Well , I would , I would say tremendously unfair . Well I don’t— </s>
I mean , we can look at numbers , we can look at performances , um— Dale , you 're exhibit A , I mean , I 'm assuming you did n't use any of these drugs , and you 're an All-Star , and uh , you know , one of the great players of— Well does n't , then does n't that make my point ? You did n't seem to be at very much of an un- , of a disadvantage ? </s>
But does n't that make my point that we don’t need them ? There’s all sorts of reasons— Why , why do we need them if , if people are able to perform at the highest level without them , and that it also provides a huge advantage if you use them , but you can still be a world class athlete , why would we need them ? Why not ban them and , and change the culture to the point to where guys think a lot time before they take this stuff ? </s>
Why do we need them ? Well we don’t , we don’t need them , and we don’t need sports either . We don’t need tackle in football , we can play two hand touch , it’s just— </s>
Yeah , but we’re not talking about— </s>
It’s just not as much interest . We’re not talking about football , the people that die , that’s not the argument . The argument is n't the inherent risks of any sports tonight , it’s performance enhancing drugs . You do n't need them to be a , a world class athlete . </s>
You do not need them . And if you don’t take them , you 're at a huge advantage . And so I , I just , I can not understand it . Would n't you agree , one last question , that the example that the young people see , would n't you say that abuse of these kind of drugs is particularly , we talk about side effects , would n't you agree that it’s particularly , um , harmful to young people , that we may not even know abuse of these kind of drugs— </s>
Again , let me— …what may happen . Let me slightly redirect it , would you agree , Dr. Fost , with superior medical knowledge , would you agree that there are risks for adolescents that are not present , at least to the same degree , and you might argue at all , for adults ? </s>
Absolutely , and I said in my remarks that I thought they should be banned in children , there should be testing in children , there ought to be— </s>
All right . </s>
…harsh penalties for suppliers to children— </s>
If that’s the case then , is n't it inevitable , if you were to allow unfettered access to performance enhancing drugs beyond a certain threshold of competition and a certain age limit , that those who aspire to play at the collegiate level , and ultimately to play at the professional level , would n't just be influenced , they’d be nearly compelled to begin using sooner than you would advocate— No— …to get there ? I don’t think so . First of all they could n't , would n't be able to get them through prescribed channels , they would n't be able to get them through illegal channels— </s>
Plenty of people get them now— And that’s why we need rigorous testing and criminal penalties for those who do it . </s>
Look , I 'm much , it’s interesting how we obsess about this issue , which again , has caused very little serious harm to adolescents , and the ones who do use them , as Julian said , are using them mainly to bodybuild , not , they 're not being used , for the most part , in uh , competitive sports . Most of the adolescent use is in the gyms , not in the playing field . But listen , alcohol kills fifty thousand people a year , and what are the big leagues doing about that . When players drink , I do n't hear anybody talking about lifetime bans for drunk driving by baseball players . </s>
That kills fifty thousand people a year , including innocent victims , including a lot of kids , and here we are talking about something that kills almost nobody . Chewing tobacco is a big problem among youth in this country , and we have the networks showing Terry Francona drooling every ten seconds during the World Series . What kind of— </s>
Although they have banned it in the minors , and they would ban it at the Major League Level if they could unilaterally impose it . But they can't— </s>
And most seriously of all is the violence by professional athletes . </s>
I 'm talking about sexual assault , and criminal violence , rampant in professional sports . No lifetime penalty , no ban , do a little community service , and come back . What message does that send— </s>
Is , is n't that why , to uh , the side of the table that is against the motion , is n't that why the argument against the use of performance enhancing drugs is best focused on competitive issues , the sanctity of the records , uh , the level playing field argument . And if we start moralizing about health dangers , or relative impact on society , then you run up against all the arguments that Dr. Fost just laid out , and is n't the best argument for this side of the table the argument about competitive balance , or competitive fairness ? </s>
True , but Doctor , remember what Dr. James Andrews said , that is we have more torn muscles , we have more pulled muscles because we have too much muscle mass for the body , and that’s the direct result of steroids and the workouts with steroids . Very briefly . That , that’s the best man . I find , I mean , one of the things here are like the guy who’s pulled over on the highway by the , by the policeman saying , but , but officer , why are you stopping me , there are all kinds of people going faster than I was ? </s>
But to , to deal with the , the young people , I mean , you 're familiar with , with the state imposed doping programs in East Germany and some of those , and the medical data arising from that . Clearly there are health impacts , adverse health impacts on the athletes— </s>
Yeah , those were horrible , and that was close to coercion , and , as I said , the side effects in kids are sufficient to have very rigorous penalties against those who do that sort of thing . Julian , your question . OK , so on the topic of children , it’s a major plank in your argument . </s>
Dale Murphy said it would send the wrong message to children , and , and Dick Pound said , uh , you did n't want your children or anyone else’s children becoming chemical stockpiles . </s>
So , the argument , as I understand it here , is we need to ban performance enhancing drugs in adults to protect our children . </s>
So , my question to Dick Pound is , don’t we have , already in society , different rules and laws for children and adults , so on your argument , um , we should ban everyone from driving motorcars , because some children may illegally drive them and kill themselves . </s>
So , my question to you is , do you think we also should ban driving cars in adults because it might be abused by some children ? PANELIST Well , or using alcohol . Is n't , is n't that a silly question ? </s>
That , that’s the , why , why do we accept the rules— Let’s say , let’s say alcohol then . …alcohol then . </s>
Should we ban alcohol for adults because kids are going to drink it ? No , no , no . I mean , the issue , the issue… …what’s the difference ? </s>
Because the community at large , sport is not going to solve every problem on the face of the planet , even though we come to affairs like this and like to pretend it can . Uh , but the community , governments , National Olympic Committee , Sports Federations , the public at large say , here are things that you should not take , and there’s a reason for them . They 're , they 're either , they 're performance enhancing , they’re risk to health , or they 're contrary to a defined term , not a pornographic definition , uh , called Spirit of Sport . And you , you examine every , um , substance or method against that matrix , and if it meets two of the three criteria , then chances are it may be on the list . There’s a good reason for it . </s>
It may be wrong . Maybe somebody’s got the science wrong . </s>
Maybe they do . Nobody’s perfect . And science goes on . But , in the meantime , that’s the community , and that’s the values that , that are reflected in , in the community . All right , we are running behind on time , and I will take some of the blame for that . </s>
George Michael , last question , and then we’ll open it up to the audience , and we’ll try and pick up the pace . George ? I’ll just make it real quick . Doctor , you said that only six percent of the tests came back positive ? In that year , that first year of universal testing . </s>
Let me just say this . Bob , you’ve got to back me up , I only have one statement . Yeah ? It was the single worst drug testing in the history of sports period . </s>
Don’t ever refer to that six percent— If you , if you failed , if you failed that test— That was a disgrace , an American disgrace . </s>
…then you failed an I.Q . </s>
test simultaneously . No— I have a strong opinion . </s>
No one thinks , no one thinks that— </s>
Thank you . …that an announced test that did n't , that did n't test for all , a whole array of designer steroids , and still showed somehow six or seven percent failing , no one thinks that’s the limit of it . </s>
In fact , you could reasonably… …many multiples beyond that— </s>
It’s worse than that . …and I think everyone who knows the dynamics of baseball at that time— We’re going to test— It’s worse than , it’s worse than that— We’re going to test next Tuesday , go ahead and drink all the orange juice you want between now and then . </s>
If you tested positive on that , on that series of tests , you could come back two weeks later , and if you were then cleaned out , they , they took away the first test . That , that was a sham . PANELIST Sham ? Let , let us open it , let us open it now , uh , to questions from the audience , uh , please , unlike some of us , get to the point quickly… And , uh , wait until you get to the microphone to pose your question and if you’re a member of the press , identify yourself as such . Yes , sir . </s>
I’m not a member of the press and I—but I would like to thank all of the panelists for your comments . </s>
Um , I’d welcome comment from any and all panelists , as to the legitimacy if any , of our Congress imposing its will on this issue and holding these hearings . What is its technical legitimacy in doing that , and philosophically do you think it’s any of their business or not— All right , we’ll let one person from each side respond to that , is it any of Congress’s business to be involved as they have been , Radley ? You—you can probably guess my answer , um…uh , just a very , very quick anecdote , when baseball first objected to the , the , uh , Congress’s jurisdiction to look into this matter , uh , Congressman Davis and Congressman Waxman sent a letter back to baseball , stating that Cong—their , their particular committee , the Government Reform Committee , had jurisdiction over any matter at any time . Uh , this is the , the sort of arrogance of Congress , they think that there’s nothing that they don’t have authority , uh , and jurisdiction over . </s>
Um , I , I…people are gon na say that , uh , the baseball anti-trust exemption , uh , somehow means that they , they have to sort of bend to the will of Congress . </s>
Uh , I would submit that if , if that’s your argument , then , everybody who gets a government benefit , uh , sort of throws , uh , all of their rights out the window from student loan recipients to , uh , public housing recipients to , you know , corporate subsidies , so— Uh , I , yeah , I , I don’t think this is an issue of Congress , I think baseball can determine what its rules ought to be , uh , on its own . On the other hand , uh , even though there may have been plenty of grandstanding involved , you can’t deny that there was movement after Congress first , uh , convened hearings in 2005 . It was , it was a perfect storm , there was Canseco’s book , BALCO was breaking , and the Congressional hearings were part of it , but it seemed to move the issue along . Oh , absolutely it did , and we—whether , whether or not that’s a good thing or bad thing that individual Congressmen can force an entire industry to sort of bend to their will , uh , I , I , I happen to find that troubling . And I , I have to say there’s something fishy going on , when the Congress holds hearings and the President takes time in a State of the Union address told about the horrors of steroids , which as far as I know haven’t killed any kids yet this year or not very many— </s>
Yes . </s>
And , and smok—and smoking , George , will kills 400,000 people every year , 400,000 , 90 percent of whom start smoking in childhood , but this is not worthy of Congressional hearings or 30 seconds of the State of the Union address— Well , the—the nation lacks an effective steroid lobby… Unlike the tobacco lobby— There’s something going on here other than deep concer— They don’t have an effective steroid lobby . There’s something going on other than deep concern for the well- being of children . </s>
Congress’s involvement . Dale maybe , what do you think ? Well , I , uh…I think , uh , it’s been helpful , I think though what we will find is that the Mitchell Report will—something that was done internally , will be of most help , uh , to this problem . Um , I think it’ll be a catalyst for us to make some progress . </s>
But I , I got ta say , if the argument is smoking or alcohol or prohibition or lasik surgery , that’s not what it says up there . It says should we allow performance-enhancing drugs , I still don’t see the correlation between bringing in the problems with alcohol which are real , I would love to next year to come back and discuss whether baseball should , uh , get rid of all their beer sponsors . I would be in favor of that , but that’s not the question tonight . </s>
There , there—it is a relatively small problem , totally agree with that . </s>
But that’s just not the question tonight . Next question from the audience . I always thought that competitive sports meant a natural competition , a motivation , an incentive , a desire to want to be the very best . That’s what we always teach our kids no matter what it is that we do—what they wan na do in life . </s>
And it seems to me , that by taking any kind of a performance-enhancing anything , you are taking away the naturalness of wanting to achieve . </s>
Of wanting to be the best , of wanting to grow . It says just pump me up , and you have a good business thing here , and put me out . To whom specifically is your question or statement directed— It’s not really a question , it’s just a confusion— </s>
Right . There have to— As to—it’s a confusion as to why— It’s not a matter of death , it’s a matter of life , why would drugs even be permissible under any level . Dr. Fost , a brief response— </s>
Like Carnac I can answer the question without even knowing the question . Place—place an envelope to your forehead when doing so in that case . Um , that’s a nice notion about sports and it’s certainly what we ought to promote for our kids but it hasn’t been what sports has been about at an elite level for 7,000 years and that’s why I mentioned the Babylonians , if you took the steroids and the growth hormone away , what you would have is literally a thousand other things that athletes do to enhance their performance , none of them natural . Uh , athletes drink Gatorade from a factory , they take pasta to carbo-load that’s made from a factory . </s>
Uh , they don’t eat potatoes out of the ground to carbo- load , they put on fancy shoes , they train at altitude , they do everything— </s>
Can I interrupt , Doctor— —there a—there’s no athlete since the beginning of time , who competed naturally to win a race . Doctor , I got ta interrupt . You’re comparing drinking Gatorade to taking anabolic steroids ? </s>
No , I’m not , I’m just saying that— What are you—well then why bring it up , it , it’s— It’s really what she bring—she said , it should be just about nature , just , people on—by their own natural ability , I don’t know a single athlete who relies on his or her own natural ability to compete . </s>
Do—do you think a hypoxic air tent is natural ? Is that a—is that a—a hypoxic air tent . This is what all US athletes use to , to boost their— Well , my understanding is the reason they do it is to level the playing field with those that live at high altitude , which , this training is readily accessible and , and permissible . But not— </s>
Performance-enhancing drugs are not permissible . To the audience— </s>
So— To the audience , yes . </s>
Yes , ma’am . I’m Sara Schorno with the Huffington Post . And this question is more for those against the notion , um , maybe particularly Mr . Pound . </s>
Setting the legalities aside and the fact that it’s against the rules , um , what difference do you see if any between an athlete using performance enhancers to stay in the game and say an actress using injections and cosmetic surgery to stay in the movies ? Be—because what we’ve agreed…in sport— But setting the rules aside is what I’m saying , I mean you mentioned a lot of ethics , and you mentioned a lot of unfair advantages . </s>
So using those two examples that you’ve used , what do you see the difference is . Well , you , you have to have rules in order to have sport . You , you can’t have sport without rules , it’s not , uh , it’s not , you know , the only , the world’s shortest rulebook I know is Australian-rules football . You know . “Get ball to end , ” and , and , uh— So I , I don’t think you can compare that . </s>
We’re talking about sport . </s>
What , what— No , no , I understand— — actresses do— </s>
—I understand sport , but , one of the arguments that you’ve used is the ethics of it . </s>
Um , that it’s against the rules because it’s unethical and because it’s unfair— </s>
No , no , no , that’s , it’s backwards . It’s unethical because you have agreed to the performance of a , a particular skill in a particular way , and you’ve broken that promise . You’ve cheated on your fellow competitor , that’s what’s unethical . So then do you think that if it were to be accepted in sports that it would then still be unethical , or if they did allow steroids within sports would it then be ethical to use them . </s>
It would not be unethical to use them . That’s right . No , no , it’s , it’s the rule . Couple more quick questions . </s>
Limit—we know—now all the hands are going up , but we don’t have time for everybody so , whom have the fine folks out there decided—yes . </s>
Uh , Jon Frankel , HBO’s “Real Sports.” Um , first thing is your , your statistic of 90 percent permanent disability in the NFL is way off and I’ve done pieces criticizing the NFL so it’s not fair to invoke that specific— What—what is the right number . Well , there’s—there is no real number , there’s , there’s no way to know what permanent disability is and that’s been one of the long-running arguments— </s>
How are you defining permanent disability , Dr. Fost . I was just quoting a New York Times study of , uh , people who had—weren’t able to perform activities of daily living , um , I think was the definition , but I don’t remember precisely . Jon— </s>
But if you have a different number I’d like to know what it is . </s>
Well , what I really would like to get at is you , you are talking about the fact that there are no , or minimal side effects when it comes to steroids and you’re comparing adults versus youth . Um , I haven’t turned on a television and seen a commercial for , um , some sort of medicine that doesn’t spend half its time telling us about the side effects , so I’m—I dare find it hard to believe that steroids don’t have some side effects that don’t have serious health implications . Um , you all on this side of the panel for the motion , seem to suggest that , any advantage , whether it’s drinking caffeine or such is a good advantage , so it is worth doing . So , I wonder whether you advocate insider trading , um…uh , in that , in that way , because it clearly gives us an advantage . </s>
My other point is to the kids , and it’s been brought up by the side against the motion and that is , why should my son , who at eight years old , who already watches Barry Bonds , when he gets to the high school level , and there’s a kid who plays second base , who’s—he knows is taking something , and all he wants to do is play second base on his high school baseball team , he may not even wan na make it to college or to the pros . He just wants to play at the high school level . Inevitably he’s gon na be faced with that decision of , should I take , or should I not . All right . Are all advantages positive advantages , and what about the scenario that Jon Frankel just laid out , who wants to respond , Radley— </s>
I’ll take the first part if , if you wan na take the second , um , I— Look , I don’t know what advantages are harmful and what advantages are helpful , I mean my , my position on this is that , part of the problem is , is what we don’t know , uh , because everything is , is , is black market and is , and it is under this veil . Uh , I think my point is that we need to lift that veil and , and trust adults to make their own decisions about what risks they’re going to take . Norm ? I think your son , uh , should , we should do everything we can to stop him from smoking , from drinking , from using steroids , and other things that are harmful and that he is not in a position to make informed choices , so I’m in favor of whatever we can reasonably do , to prohibit it , make it illegal , make it criminal , to test , to use kids as indicators for these activities when they’re occurring , so I’m completely sympathetic to your concern , and I think we should do everything we can to stop it . We apologize to all those audience members who had good questions of their own but because of time we have to move on to the summation portion but before we do that let me pose a question to this side of the table . </s>
It’s often tossed out , well , people use various medications for this reason or that , or , uh , the woman from the Huffington Post used the example of an actress who might resort to plastic surgery as she ages , other performance enhancers of various kinds . But isn’t that a specious argument because , there is no objective competition for who has the fewest wrinkles . And if , and I don’t mean to be flippant , but if there were some kind of competition , that people cared about , and that people entered into in good faith , and that had an ongoing history that people cared about , and that competition entailed how frequently and with what level of , uh , of effectiveness one could perform sexually , then perhaps you might , you might have to put in rules against the use of Viagra , one com—competitor to another . But that doesn’t apply , that doesn’t apply to the use , or the suggested use of Viagra , it doesn’t apply to the suggested use of plastic surgery . In competitive sports , which are , which are conducted with a structure and with objective rules and goals , it seems to me that whatever anyone uses for performance enhancement of one kind or another , outside those spheres , isn’t analogous . </s>
Response ? No , I agree , I mean we’re—but , but we keep going back to the rules here and , none of us is advocating breaking the rules , uh , I mean the purpose of this debate tonight is to deter—we’re debating what those rules ought to be . Uh , I’m not saying that once you enter into an agreement with a league that says you will not use these—this list of substances , I’m not defending people who then go and use those substances , I mean that—that’s fraud basically . Um , what we’re debating here is what those rules ought to be— </s>
But you would agree that what is used outside competitive sports and taken for granted in society , really is not a persuasive argument for what should be allowed within competitive sports . You have to make a different argument and maybe there’s a good one but that isn’t it . Uh , I think it’s a different argument to say that because we use liposuction or , or get , uh , Botox injections , that that’s the same as , uh , uh , entering into an agreement , uh , to , to , to have a competition , uh , under , under set guidelines— Yeah , if there were a flat-abs competition and one guy had to do sit-ups and someone else got liposuction , it wouldn’t be a fair competition , if anyone cared about that competition . Absolutely , if it—if you’re having a beauty contest and the , and the judge—and the , the criteria is natural beauty and someone went out and got breast implants , uh , and won the competition— </s>
Right . —I , I , I would object to that , yes . All right , it is time now…on that uplifting note , uh , for our , for our summation . And , and here is the order of debater presentation , it begins with Dick Pound . </s>
Two minutes . Thank you , I think that , that out of the mouths of the other side you’ve heard , um , all kinds of reasons why this , uh…motion should be voted on in our , uh , direction . </s>
Human nature is not gon na change . Um , the—we’ve heard from a number of the , uh , other , uh , the other opponents talking about , there would be ongoing development of these things , without care for safety . </s>
In , in the cat-and-mouse game of trying to improve what’s out there , there would be no care for safety , so that if you have a doctor prescribing 10 cc’s of…anabolic steroid , uh , and everybody’s doing that , then there’s no more advantage . </s>
So the person who wants the advantage is gon na use 20 , or 30 , or 40 . And that will be pursued , uh , as will the , the sort of , uh , research in that area— We had Kelly White , uh , American sprinter , come to the World Anti-Doping Agency after she got caught in the BALCO situation . They were giving her the clear THG . She said she was having two enormous menstrual cycles every month , and she had blood pressure that was going right to the roof , and she went to Conte and the others and said , uh , this is happening , he said oh , huh . </s>
Well , maybe you should take a little less and , and , oh , and drink some more water . </s>
They had no idea…the stuff was going from a laboratory bench into her system . And , and the system of other athletes . Uh , excellence within sport is what everyone searches for , but it’s excellence within agreed rules . And , and the community speaks . That , that— </s>
30 seconds , Dick . </s>
30 ? 30 . The community has spoken , I think the community has a legitimate interest in things that may be a health interest . </s>
You know , what happens in the major league influences triple-A , double-A , single-A , high school ball . There are pyramids in hockey and basketball . This is a public-health problem . And finally I thought , um , one point made by , by Dr. Fost was , was quite telling . He said , more or less , that alcohol—in response to this gentleman’s question , alcohol , tobacco , steroids , and other dangerous things should be discouraged . </s>
And I agree with him entirely . Now his summation for the motion , Norm Fost . Uh , every person on this panel agrees that people should play by the rules , and there isn’t anyone up here who has defended breaking the rules . </s>
The topic that’s here for debate tonight is , what are the basis of those rules . If there was a rule prohibiting people playing with red hair , we would say of course if you have read hair you can’t play . But we wouldn’t say that that was a sensible rule . </s>
So rules have to have some moral basis or some rational basis . The fact that they simply are there doesn’t tell us anything about the basis of them . </s>
When we look at what the claims for them are , they seem hypocritical , inconsistent , or based on bad facts . People say they’re based on concerns about fair competition , but sports allow grossly unfair competition , Olympic sports , countries against countries , baseball , Yankees against Brewers , the leagues tolerate unfair competition , so I simply don’t believe them when they say they’re passionately concerned about fair competition . They say they’re concerned about harm . When the president of the— One minute— </s>
—National Hockey League , says that he’s— has screening for drugs because he’s concerned about the safety and health of the athletes , and there’s no laughter in the press room , you have to really wonder about what’s going on . Uh , if you have good arguments you don’t make up things . We have Lyle Alzado being rolled out again tonight , three times . </s>
There’s not a doctor in America who knows anything about steroids and cancer who thinks Lyle Alzado’s tumor had anything to do with steroids . There’s not another steroid user ever who had the kind of cancer he had . </s>
So if the headline had said “Lyle Alzado , Alcohol User , Has Brain Cancer , ” I guess we’d be talking about alcohol causing brain cancer . 20 seconds . </s>
So the need to roll out misinformation over and over again suggests there’s not much going on the other side . </s>
Thank you . And now speaking against the motion in summation , Dale Murphy . Well , um , tonight was—it—the , the motion is about performance- enhancing drugs , should they be allowed in sports , I agree with , uh , what has been said , that it wasn’t about breaking the rules . But I’ve also heard performance-enhancing drugs tonight compared to your morning latte , uh , to lasik eye surgery , maybe we should not allow glasses , or a contact lens . </s>
Uh , but that is not the question , if the question was about alcohol abuse , again , I think we would all love to come back and talk about that . But performance-enhancing drugs is the issue , and to me , this , no matter how long it takes , this is a , a , a battle worth fighting . Um , what happens if I’m a major league baseball player under a doctor’s supervision , he tests me , looks at me , looks at my blood pressure , looks at all the factors and decides , you know , Dale , I don’t think you are gon na be on our guinea pigs as Dr. Fost , um , uh , intimated that we , we could use major league baseball players for if we— </s>
One minute . —if we let this go . Because your blood pressure is , you know , I know you’re trying to have kids , we don’t wan na boost your testosterone . </s>
Um , it—I—if , if , if it is generally acceptable to use these things in my sport , but I can’t use ‘em or choose not to , I am at , at totally unfair , um , disadvantage . Speaking of the Yankees , and that they have more money than anybody else . Dr. Fost must’ve not been following the Yankees during the ‘80s . When they had more money than anybody else . </s>
If , if somebody with a lot more money than George Steinbrenner wants to buy the Yankees , again , that is fair competition , you can spend your own money , um , but it doesn’t guarantee success . Again , performance-enhancing drugs somehow was linked to the fact that the Yankees have an unfair advantage because they have a higher payroll . Again , the two don’t compare , that’s what we’re discussing tonight , and— Time to wrap up . And , um , to me , again , uh…Julian mentioned a zero-tolerance rule , that it’s confusing and we don’t know what’s out there . </s>
In baseball there is not a zero-tolerance rule . I wish there was , I think we would make great strides . In the—and again , in comparing that to the zero-tolerance— </s>
Time . —rule we have , on gambling on baseball . We can make progress and change the culture . </s>
Radley Balko . Um— I—I’ve been really disturbed over the last month , listening to sports talk radio over…the— It’s generally disturbing , Radley . Yeah . Well there—there’s been a , a certain amount of glee and kind of a “gotcha” mentality to , to the Marion Jones situation and , uh , you know…I find it troubling that a woman is—a young woman is being pulled away from her kids , uh , and put in jail , uh , for six months leaving her kids without a mother , uh , for that time , over , uh , you know , a , a decision she made about her own health knowing the risks involved . </s>
Now granted she broke the rules . But , we’re in a…sort of a feeding frenzy about this at this point and it’s a , it’s a common tactic or it’s a common phenomenon , uh , when drug issues hit the media , uh , things tend to spin off into a moral panic . And , we sort of saw it tonight from our opponents , I mean the question tonight , the entire time is what should the rules governing sports be . And , a commoner frame particularly for Mr . Pound was that , well , we shouldn’t allow— </s>
One minute . —performance-enhancing drugs in sports because the rules say we shouldn’t allow them . Um , and I guess what I’m hoping you’ll take away from this after listening to our side of this is that maybe , every now and then we should sort of take a step back and examine whether the rules themselves are moral and are justified . And some applause for Radley for actually using up only a minute and 120 seconds , Wow . that was good . All right . </s>
Speaking against the motion . And summarizing his viewpoint , George Michael . </s>
The mother went to jail because Mom cheated , not with steroids , but it was a check-cashing scheme , and people like interviewed her a lot , before she ever became a star . And I bought in and believed everything she said when she said she didn’t use . </s>
I believed her . So that’s maybe why you might hear a little glee . Doctor , about kids . </s>
I don’t know if you all have ever heard of Efrain Marrero . </s>
Efrain Marrero—have you ever heard of him , Bob ? </s>
The kicker . No , this is , this is , no , this is his cousin . Efrain Marrero’s— His cousin— —a kid wanted to play— </s>
His cousin— Hey . Wanted to play baseball . He was good , not great . </s>
But he found out , someone told him , he’s 19 years old , he was told use steroids , and you’re gon na be good enough . </s>
You’ve got everything you need , just need some more power . So he starts using steroids and he becomes good . This is not make-believe , this is real . </s>
Efrain Marrero , 19 years old , his parents found out , and like good responsible parents Dad said , get off that stuff , because he was starting to get a little nutso . </s>
Get off that stuff or you can never play another baseball game . He obeyed his parents . </s>
One minute— And he stopped cold turkey . One week later he went into his bedroom and he blew his brains out . But there’s no evidence , that it was steroids that did it . </s>
Time up . </s>
Actually breaking Radley’s record by seven seconds . And the last summation comes from Julian Savulescu . Julian . Okay , both sides agree that cheating is ruining sport , and that this is really the tip of the iceberg . </s>
Their position is that we should increase the war on drugs , our position is that we should adopt a policy of regulated access to performance enhancers that are safe enough , and that are consistent with the particular sport’s spirit . </s>
This is not a debate about steroids . If indeed , these claims which are largely anecdotal claims are true , that steroids have these terrible effects , our side grants that steroids under those circumstances should be banned . However , that doesn’t deal with the use of human erythropoietin up to a hematacrit of 50 percent , it doesn’t deal with caffeine which is already a performance enhancer that’s been legalized , it doesn’t deal with growth hormone . There are many , many substances , in baseball , you could use Modafinil to increase reaction time , you could use new neutropics such as the Piracetam family to increase reaction time . </s>
These substances may well be safe enough . The question is should performance enhancers be allowed , and there are many performance enhancers , our side believes , which should be allowed . </s>
Their position is bound to fail , it has been failing , it will fail because the prize money and the sophistication of the drive to technology— 45 seconds . Paradoxically , it harms athletes . Our proposal is enforceable , it frees up the limited resources to focus on drugs that may be affecting children , which we grant should not have access to drugs , it could be focused on drugs which are substantially un— un— harmful to athletes , and drugs which hare against the true spirit of sport . </s>
This is not a debate about steroids , it’s about whether performance enhancement itself is against the spirit of sport . As we’ve argued , performance enhancement is not against the spirit of sport , it’s been a part of sport through its whole history , and to be human , is to be better , or at least to try to be better . Julian , thank you . We also thank all of our audience members , and again , though we had a spirited and I think every informative debate I wish we had had more time for questions from the audience , but you do get the final say , because now , you get to decide which side carried the debate . </s>
Once again , pick up the keypad attached to the left armrest of your seat , and after my prompt , press “1” if you are now for the motion , “We should accept performance-enhancing drugs in competitive sports , ” press “2” if you are against the motion , or “3 , ” if somehow after all this you remain undecided . Go ahead and cast your votes . Apparently the debate continues even as you cast your votes . </s>
And , and after—after we tabulate , I know your question , it’s a good one , and we will , we will pose it , I wan na thank the debaters and the audience , uh , for their participation . And we have to take care of some housekeeping here , the next Intelligence Squared debate will be on Tuesday , February 12th , here at Asia Society and Museum . The motion to be debated then is , “America should be the world’s policeman.” </s>
It will be moderated by “60 Minutes” correspondent Morley Safer . </s>
The panelists for the next debate are , for the motion , Senior Fellow for National Security Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations Max Boot , Professor and Director of the American Foreign Policy Program at Johns Hopkins University , Michael Mandelbaum , and author and director of the Centre for Social Cohesion , Douglas Murray . Against the motion , president and founder of Eurasia Group Ian Bremer , President and CEO of the Henry L. Stimson Center , Ellen Laipson , and Matthew Parris , writer for the Times of London and broadcaster for the BBC . </s>
An edited version of tonight’s Intelligence Squared debate can be heard locally on WNYC-AM 820 , on Sunday , January 27th , at 8 p.m . These debates are also heard on more than 90 NPR stations across the country , please check your local NPR member station listings for the dates and times of broadcast , outside New York City . Copies of Dick Pound’s books , Inside Dope : How Drugs Are the Biggest Threat to Sport , Why You Should Care and What Should Be Done About Them , and Inside the Olympics : A Behind the Scenes Look at the Politics , the Scandals , and the Glory of the Games , are on sale upstairs in the lobby , you can also purchase DVD’s from previous debates here tonight , or from the Intelligence Squared website . And now , very , very briefly , should there be two tiers of sports , Olympics or otherwise , one for those who use , one for those who don’t , one on this side , one on that side , 10 seconds . Should there be two tiers ? </s>
Why not . Why not he says , and uses only one second . Should there— Should there be two tiers , Olympics or otherwise , users , non-users— Ab—absolutely not , because the , the bad users will pretend that they’re non-users . </s>
All right . And now…after the debaters did their best to sway you , before the debate , 18 percent of you were for the motion that performance-enhancing drugs should be permissible in competitive sports . After the debate , 37 percent agree with this side of the table . Before the debate , 63 percent were against the motion . Now 59 percent are against the motion . </s>
Before the debate , 19 percent of you were undecided , and after the debate , only 4 percent of you wander into the night still shaking your heads , so— In summation , 59 percent against , 37 percent for , so , they improved their position , once the debate was over but not enough— We just ran out of time—we just ran out of time— —not enough to— You didn’t lose , you just ran out of time , many an athlete and coach , has voiced the same lament . </s>
Thanks to all of you . And all of these debates , which is now -- we are now in our fifth season . We 've done more than 50 of these debates . And we 're delighted to have all of you here . </s>
But they all happen because of one man , Robert Rosenkranz , who is the chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , who brought Intelligence Squared to the city and to this country , in fact . And so I 'd like to welcome him to make opening remarks and set the frame for what we 're actually talking about here . Bless you for coming . Intelligence Squared is primarily known as a public policy debate series , so I 'd like to start the evening by sharing with you the reasons we wanted to do a debate about religion . </s>
America has always incorporated complex ideas about religion in its political culture . Creationism is invoked in the most famous words of our founding documents , `` We hold these truths to be self-evident , that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights . '' The First Amendment to the Constitution begins with the ringing words , `` Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion . '' But note these words do not banish religion from the public square . </s>
Indeed , many of the original 13 colonies had official state religions which the amendment protects from the actions of Congress . Nor is there any constitutional issue when the president , in his role as commander in chief , hires ministers and rabbis and priests to perform religious duties as member of the Armed Forces . Tonight 's debate should prove equally complex . Proponents of the motion might cite the violence perpetrated in the name of religion while opponents will counter that most warfare throughout history was totally or primarily about territory and economic advantage . Proponents might cite the absence of proof for central religious beliefs , indeed , the repugnance of some of them , while opponents emphasize the utility of faith and ritual and helping believers cope with the challenges of life . </s>
But both sides are likely to concur that every well-ordered society needs some key moral principles and that every thoughtful person needs a sense of meaning and purpose in life . The key question for tonight 's debate , the complex question , is whether those central needs can be better met in a world with or without religion . We have a very outstanding panelist group tonight with us . And it 's my privilege at this point to turn the evening back to John Donvan and to our great panel . </s>
Thank you . Thank you . And I just -- I would really like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for making this all possible . </s>
True or false , the world would be better off without religion ? That 's what we 're here to debate , another verbal joust from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . </s>
The world would be better off without religion . Two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides , one for and one against . </s>
And only one team will win . You are live judges . You , our live audience , will be the judges . </s>
Let 's meet our debaters . They include on the team arguing for the motion , the great-great-grandson of Charles Darwin , author and filmmaker , Matthew Chapman . By his side and on his side , a philosopher who takes a humanistic view of ethics , master of the new College of the Humanities , A.C. Grayling . Opposing them , and here to argue against the motion is one of the most influential conservative thinkers in the nation , president of the King 's College , Dinesh D'Souza . </s>
And his teammate is the rabbi of Sinai temple in Los Angeles , California , David Wolpe . So this is a contest . </s>
It 's a debate . And you , our audience here at the Skirball Center , will decide the winner . By the time the debate has ended , we 'll have asked you to vote two times , once before and once again at the end . And the team that has changed the most minds , the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner . So let 's go on to the preliminary vote . </s>
You have a keypad at your seat on the right hand side . </s>
And our motion is , again , `` The world would be better off without religion . '' And if you agree with this motion , and it 's a negative , without , if you agree with this motion , means you want less religion , push number one . </s>
It 's these guys . If you disagree with this motion , push number two . </s>
And if you 're undecided , push number three . </s>
And if you -- you can ignore the other numbers . And if you made an error , just correct it , and the system will lock in your last vote . </s>
So remember , we 're going to let you know at the end of the debate what that baseline number is , and we 're going to have you vote a second time after the third round . We go in three rounds , opening statements , a middle round where you 're involved , and the debaters address one another directly , and then a closing round of short summary statements . So let 's get started . Onto round one . Our motion is , `` The world would be better off without religion . '' </s>
And here to speak in support of the motion , A.C. Grayling , Anthony Grayling , philosopher . Put that on your business card , I guess . But it 's true . </s>
In addition to your current position at the New College of the Humanities , the number of books that you have written on philosophy is now approaching three dozen ? </s>
And I understand that as an undergraduate at the University of Sussex , you decided you needed more college , more university . So simultaneously , you pursued a second Bachelor of Arts degree up in London , so you did college twice at the same time ? Is that -- what else did -- Yes , it 's true . It 's crazy . </s>
What did you do in your spare time ? Yeah . </s>
It 's crazy , but it 's true . Ladies and gentlemen , A.C. Grayling . Thank you . </s>
John , thank you very much indeed . I must begin by asking you , if I may , to focus on what the proposition is before us . We 're not here to discuss the existence of God . We are not here to discuss whether it 's rational , irrational to have faith . </s>
We 're here to discuss a sociological phenomenon , a man-made phenomenon , religion . You can see the difference . You might call in question whether or not gods and goddesses . </s>
But you ca n't call in question whether or not there is religion . There 's plenty of it . History is full of it , and it exists around us all the time today . </s>
By the way , I say that religion is man-made advisedly . There are very few women indeed in the upper half of hierarchies of the world 's religions , which perhaps has something to do with the point . Now , religions are very diverse in nature . </s>
They have different interpretations of their deities . They say different things about what we can wear and what we can eat and when , how many wives we can have , what rituals we must follow . Despite the fact that they all take the view that they 've got the right story , they differ from one another quite dramatically in a number of respects . And this is why , through the course of history , they 've burdened mankind with a huge number of conflicts and a great deal of divisiveness . </s>
But I 'm not going to bore you by rehearsing the story of crusades and inquisitions and the rest . </s>
It 's a very familiar matter . Although it is , of course , in the interests of apologists of religions to try to forget them . </s>
Rather , I wanted to talk about things that religions have in common with one another rather than the things that divide them . </s>
They have two things in common with one another . Most of the time in history , and among many of the orthodox manifestations of religion today , they are similar to one another in -- most of them , giving second-class status to women and being hostile to gays , in being very opposed to most kinds of progress , especially scientific progress . The reason being , of course , that they take it that they received the truth a long time ago , anything between one and 3,000 years ago . And so things that are challenging and are new and offer us different views of the world , they find unpalatable . </s>
And so they tend to be very traditionalist , very conservative and rather retrogressive . And that explains a great deal of the social policy and political endeavor that the religions engage in . That 's one thing that they tend to have in common with one another . But another thing they have in common with one another is a very important point is that they share a structural feature . </s>
In fact , they are -- the religions are paradigmatic of a certain kind of organization , what I call a monolithic ideology , a one-size-fits all , top- down , totalizing ideology which says we 've got the right story , and you 've got to sign up for it . If you do n't sign up for our story , if you do n't agree , you are going to pay a sanction of one kind or another . </s>
And during the course of history , those sanctions have sometimes been very terrible . It 's in this respect in which religions in history and in their orthodox manifestations now , plus in all their manifestations , tend to share with total -- other kinds of totalizing ideologies . So that 's why it 's no great surprise that Joseph Stalin , for example , was educated in the seminary . </s>
What those totalitarianisms share is very , very common . inquisition in Spain in the 15th century and Stalin 's Soviet Union in the 20th century say the same thing , `` We 've got the answer , you 've got to agree , and if you do n't , you 're in trouble . '' So they have these two features , and the second of them , the structural feature , the idea of being in charge of the truth or of possessing the right story about life in the universe is very opposed to the enlightenment outlook on which our modern Western liberal democracies are based , the enlightenment of the 18th century taught us to think that there is n't one right answer for everybody . </s>
It taught us pluralism , taught us individual autonomy , it taught us liberty of conscience , it taught us democracy . Democracy is about people having a conversation , the great conversation of society in which we negotiate with one another about how we go forward , how we organize ourselves in society , and that 's very different indeed from thinking that there is one great ruler , one monarch , whether in the sky or on the ground , who tells us what we should do , and that we must n't think for ourselves , but we must all be orthodox , and indeed yet this ethical point is a very important one . There are those people who think that you ca n't have religion -- you ca n't have morality without religion , and of course , that is n't true . Everything good about religious morality , loving your neighbor , kindness , concern for others , responsibility as a member of the community , is shared by nonreligious ethical outlooks also . They 're very common to all the great ethical theories . </s>
I 'm an atheist and a humanist , and those values matter deeply to me . If you look at ancient Greek philosophy for example , a dominant strain of thought for nearly 1,000 years before Christianity came to command the mind of Europe , and you see that those values were shared by those thinkers , not because they thought they were told them by a deity but because reason and human experience had offered it to them . And the final point is this . People say , `` What 's wrong with moderate religion ? '' you know , those nice folks who go to church on Sundays and who take part in their neighborhoods . </s>
And here 's the problem with that , moderate religion is religion where people do a little bit of cherry picking . They take the best bits of the religion , and some of the more embarrassing , or difficult , or awkward , or bits they leave to one side . I know very , very few Christians who give away all they own to the poor , who take no thought for tomorrow , who turn their backs on their families if their families disagree and families are going to disagree if they do give away everything , who do n't marry , who stay celibate . I find very few Christians actually live the New Testament morality , they cherry pick . </s>
Unkind people would call that `` hypocrisy . '' At the other end of the scale , however , are those who take their religion extremely seriously , the extremists , we call it them . The point about the extremists is that they are the most honest of the people who have a religious view because they commit themselves to what their tradition tells them , and they stay closest to the text . Now , if that 's real religion , that 's honest religion , the world is very much better off without it . </s>
And if the world is much better off without the true and the honest form of religion , why not put the hypocrites in with them , too ? Thank you . Thank you . Thank you , Anthony Grayling . </s>
Our motion is `` The world would be better off without religion , '' and here to speak against the motion , David Wolpe . He 's the rabbi of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles , California . Newsweek Magazine named you -- what is this , the way it was phrased , the number one pulpit rabbi in America . I hope we 're not voting on that tonight . I just want to -- I mean , do they have playoffs or -- </s>
Oh , yes . Yeah , stadiums , playoffs , National league , American league . All right . Ladies and gentlemen -- this pulpit is yours -- </s>
Thank you . -- David Wolpe . The caustic and brilliant philosopher at Columbia University , Sydney Morgan Besser , was once sitting in the back of a lecture where the English philosopher , J.L . Austin , said that we know that two negatives make a positive , if I say I will never not miss you , it means I 'll always miss you . But he said there 's no language in which two positives make a negative . </s>
And from the back of the auditorium Morgan Besser said , yeah , right . Now , I 'm going to offer you two positives . </s>
I hope not only that they will add to a positive but that you will approach this not in that skeptical frame of mind but at least open to the possibility that there 's a lot about religion that you do n't hear . You will never see a headline that says religious man feeds hungry man . But it happens all the time . In fact you might be surprised to know what the largest aid organization in the world is . It’s called World Vision , with over 40,000 people in over 100 countries . </s>
That’s more than CARE , Save the Children , the worldwide operations of the United States Agency for International Development all combined . And if you didn’t know that , it’s because the good that religion does is sort of oft interred with its bones , but you hear about every depredation , every sin , every bad thing . And yet today , all over the world , there are millions of religious aid workers who are sustaining people in places that you’ve never heard of and never visited . </s>
Right before this conference , both Dinesh and I were in Mexico in Puebla at the Festival of Ideas , and I rode back to the airport with Nicholas Kristof from the New York Times and we were talking about this issue . </s>
And he said , “You know , everywhere I go , I see religious aid workers , day after day , year after year , and the difference , ” he said , “between religious aid workers and others is they stay.” They don’t go when the crisis is over . And this parallels my own experience when I was in Haiti , helping a friend rebuild an orphanage . Almost every person I met was a religious aid worker . I remember going to the market in Haiti and I met this man , and I said to him , “What are you doing here ? ” </s>
And he said , “Well , I’m a Mennonite , and I and my group are building homes in the rural areas outside of Port-au-Prince.” So I said , “Why are you doing this ? ” He said , “Well , I’ve been here for about five or six years , and I came because my son was sent by the church community 20 years ago . </s>
And after 15 years of watching my son do this , I thought it’s time for me to go.” This story could be duplicated again and again and again . And , in fact , if tomorrow you took religion out of the world , the world would be tremendously impoverished in terms of the way in which people who are in trouble get help . </s>
Evangelical organizations were the first ones on the ground after the tsunami in Indonesia , and that story could be repeated again and again throughout the world . That’s point one . Here’s point two . The Oxford Handbook of Religion and Health is about to come out in 2012 , the Second Edition . </s>
In case you won’t find the time to read it , I’m now going to save you the time . This is a handbook that anthologizes over 3,000 studies from the New England Journal of Medicine , JAMA , Lancet , all peer-review journals that are not particularly sympathetic to religion . </s>
And this is what it says . Religious Americans give more to charity , volunteer more , participate in civic processes more , attend more meetings , are more likely to vote , to volunteer , less likely to drink , divorce , do drugs . They are much more inclined to be optimistic and feel meaningful about life . They’re less inclined to depression , less inclined to suicide , less inclined to suicidal thoughts . </s>
They are much more helpful in their communities . If you want to measure altruism and empathy , the best measure is not age , gender , income , education . </s>
It’s whether you’re involved in a religious community . I’ll give you one study at the University of Miami . They studied people who’d been diagnosed with AIDS , whether they turned to religion or away from religion . </s>
Those who turned to religion , several months later , had lower viral loads , lower CD4 counts . They were healthier than those who didn’t . </s>
In fact , religion , if you’re part of a religious community as measured by attending services and reading Scripture and praying , it adds on average seven years to your life if you’re a white American male , 14 years if you’re an African American male . Now , the dean of this research , Harold Koenig at Duke University says that he has to point out to you that you may spend those seven years in church , but nonetheless , you have to decide what you want to do with the time . Still , you have the time to do it . </s>
All of this -- all of this is a way of emphasizing that religion and being part of a religious community does enormous good . I see it day after day , week after week . The little nameless , unremembered acts of kindness and of love about which Wordsworth wrote , that’s what religious people do and in part because it’s a system that encourages goodness , which is why when a religious person does something wrong , people get particular upset . “How can he do this ? ” </s>
He’s supposed to be religious . Every time someone complains about the synagogue , the call begins as follows : “How , in a synagogue , could you…” which is a way of saying you’re supposed to aspire to be better . </s>
And that’s exactly right . Mother Teresa was once tending to the wounds of a leper in Calcutta . And wiping the separating wounds from this sick and dying person . And a journalist who 'd been following her around for several days said to her , `` I would n't do that for a million dollars . '' And without looking up , she said , `` Neither would I . '' It 's true . </s>
Many people of all different beliefs and no beliefs do good in this world . But if you want to find an organized system that encourages people to be better , to transcend themselves , that seeks to make the world colorful , kind , compassionate , giving , good , a system that often fails but at least aspires to that , not in little enclaves of this class or this school , but worldwide , consistently , the only one we have ever had is religion . The world without it would be a poorer , sadder and crueler place . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , David Wolpe . And here 's where we are . We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have four debaters , two teams of two , fighting it out over this motion , `` The world would be better off without religion . '' </s>
We 've heard from the first two speakers , and now onto the third . Speaking for the motion , Matthew Chapman . He is a writer and cofounder and president of Science Debate , and in a sense is our real renaissance man tonight . You 've also directed films , written books , written magazine articles . You were particularly fascinated by a case I also covered of the Dover School Board wanting to push back against the theory of evolution . </s>
And you wrote extensively about that . </s>
Of course , you do have some vested interest in your -- it 's -- it 's on your mother 's side , your great-great-grandfather ? My great-great-grandfather on my mother 's side , yes . </s>
All right . So you have some sparkling DNA walking around tonight as you come to this argument . Ladies and gentlemen , Matthew Chapman . </s>
Thank you . I am not a professional like these guys , so I 'm going to read my notes . I apologize . </s>
Religion makes two big claims : God really exists , and religion makes us behave better . But does religion make us behave better ? To partially answer that question , let me read you a verse or two from the Bible . Deuteronomy , Chapter 25 , Verses 11 and 12 . `` When men strive together one with another , and the wife of the one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of him that smiteth him and puteth forth a hand and taketh him by the secrets , then shalt thou cut off her hand . '' Roughly translated , this means that if you 're in a fight , and your wife tries to help you by grabbing your opponent 's balls , you should chop her hand off . </s>
It 's there . I mean , I can show you . I know it 's kind of cheap to poke fun at the Bible because it 's so easy , but -- -- but there is -- there is a serious point here , which is that far from making us behave better , religion often complicates and distorts morality . By any reasonable standards , hacking bits off your wife is far worse than her squeezing your enemy 's nuts . </s>
The thing is that in almost any holy book , you can find something that will validate just about anything . And afterwards , you do n't have to defend the humanity of your actions or take responsibility because God told you to do it . </s>
Believe it or not , there 's more atheism up here than faith . A.C. Grayling and I are atheists . </s>
David and Dinesh are too , except when it comes to their own religion . Every other religion , they 're atheist about . This is why religion is divisive . Every one on earth wants food , water , shelter , love , for their children to grow up to be happy and in a peaceful world . </s>
These common desires are so profound they ought to make war an absurdity , a violence against self . </s>
Religion , however , makes everyone an infidel to someone . </s>
But we 're no longer ignorant , isolated tribes who think the earth is flat and do n't know what lies around the corner . We have photographs of our planet from space . </s>
And most of us have met people of many races . We know our world and who we share it with . And we also know that critical worldwide problems will require worldwide unity . </s>
In this context , religion 's continuing assistance , insistence that my God is better than yours is disastrous , which leads me to credulity . There are literally thousands of gods available . Which one you believe in is really just an accident of birth . </s>
If David and Dinesh had been born in Afghanistan , they 'd both be Muslim probably . Or they 'd be dead . Like most people -- like most believers , however , they have faith in their inherited gods . They have n't tested the rest because there 's far too many of them . </s>
How then do they know that their god exists and the other gods do n't or that their god is better than the other gods ? Because they 've been told by an authority figure . </s>
And here 's how he did it . He said , our God is supreme , but he 's invisible . </s>
We have no proof he exists . But if you have faith , if you make a big effort to believe in him , you will believe in him . It 's fantastic . They take the weakest point of the argument and make it a condition of entry so you overlook it . </s>
But if , in the most important area of your life , your philosophy no less , the first thing you learn as a child is that faith is absolutely essential , and evidence absolutely is n't , how can this not affect the way you think about everything ? You 've been brain washed to be credulous and submissive to authority . </s>
This affects many aspects of life , including the functioning of democracy and the understanding of science , both of which demand that you insist on evidence , question everything and take nothing on faith from anyone . Here 's an example . Evolution through natural selection over billions of years is one of the best supported theories in science . </s>
But 40 to 50 percent of Americans believe the earth is only six to 8,000 years old and that God made us as we are now . Nearly 50 percent -- I mean , it 's really extraordinary . It 's unheard of in any other -- in any other culture except Muslim countries . I 've written widely on this subject and met creationists of all types . </s>
Often , they have -- I 'd say usually they have no idea what evolution is . But they dispute it with passion from a religious standpoint , faith over reason . Evidence infuriates them , as does science itself . </s>
And this antipathy to science has slowed down stem cell research , continues to harm the health of women and girls and contributes to cynicism about scientific issues like global warming . But none of this captures the human suffering caused by religion . I grew up next to my gay uncle and his partner . When I was nine , I discovered they faced long prison sentences if their homosexuality was revealed . This was justified by Leviticus 20:13 . </s>
And the verse was often quoted by both politicians and the clergy . `` If a man lieth with a man as he lieth with a woman , both of them have committed an abomination . They shall surely be put to death . '' This barbaric verse is still used by Christians , including Catholics and evangelicals . And violence is only its most obvious consequence . </s>
I end where I began . Religion claims to provide morality . But as can be seen in its divisiveness , its homophobia and in its almost universal subjugation of women , it just as often deforms morality . The question is n't whether religion can sometimes do good . Of course it can and has . </s>
The question is , can we come up with something better that does not depend on dangerous and childish faith and thousands of competing gods ? </s>
Can we persuade people that it 's possible to live a good , peaceful and happy life guided only by human conscience and modern knowledge ? </s>
When people who believe in martyrdom and an afterlife will soon get weapons of mass destruction , I think we have to , that we can and that we will . And that 's why I ask you to support the motion that `` the world would be better off without religion . '' Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Matthew Chapman . This is our motion , `` The world would be better off without religion . '' </s>
And now here to speak against the motion , Dinesh D'Souza . He 's the president of the King 's College . He is a leading conservative thinker in the country from a very young age , starting in his college years . </s>
As a young man also , he was an advisor to President Reagan . You 've also written a lot of books . Now , your opponent has written three times as many books as you . </s>
But I hate to tell you , Anthony , that Dinesh has written about five times as many best sellers as you have . So I think you trump on that . Ladies and gentlemen , Dinesh D'Souza . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza : Thank you . It 's my peculiar fate in this debate to be speaking last and therefore to have to digest the statements of the other speakers . </s>
I must say this puts me an odd position . I feel a bit like the mosquito in a nudist colony . I 'm not sure where to begin . I guess I 'll begin by noting that there were two definitions that have been advanced by the other side that actually I think help our case . The first one is the idea that people who have religious beliefs are hypocritical . </s>
But notice that in making this accusation what was being alleged is that religious believers have ideals higher than they can live up to . And this is advanced as hypocrisy , in other words , holding up to a standard and falling short of it . Now , that is actually not hypocrisy . If you read the Bible , Jesus does n't call people hypocrites because their ideals are too high . </s>
He calls people hypocrites who pretend to be one thing and are really another . The problem with the Pharisees was n't that they had high principles , is that they did n't have principles but they pretended to be something they were n't , so we 've seen a subtle shift in the meaning of hypocrisy , a shift that is advanced by the atheist side , why ? To basically pull down the moral ideals that we hold up that are higher than ourselves . </s>
That I would suggest is a very bad thing . </s>
Now , Matthew made the argument that religion is a function of where you 're born . If you were born in India , you 're going to be a Hindu -- actually I was born in India , I was raised Catholic , but never mind -- that your religious identity is formed as a result of where you 're born . If you 're born in Afghanistan you 're a Muslim and so on . Well I think this applies to all our beliefs . </s>
Let 's say for example that somebody born in Oxford , England is more likely to subscribe to the theory of evolution than someone born in Oxford , Mississippi . Somebody who is born in New York City is more likely to have formed Einstein 's theory of relativity than someone born in New Guinea . Now what does that say about whether evolution and relativity are true ? Nothing . The fact of your birth is irrelevant to the merit of the idea , so there 's a kind of sleight of hand here , you have to judge the ideas by their own merits . </s>
Now , would the world be better without religion ? You ca n't answer that question without looking to see what religion has done in the world , but you 've got to compare it to what the world would be like without religion . There 's been some allusion to the boring crimes of religion , but let me suggest that those crimes , even the worst of them , are infinitesimal compared to the crimes of atheist regimes that are far greater in magnitude , far longer in duration , and actually are still going on . If you consider , for example , a tragedy like the inquisition , a crime , I admit it , and yet over 400 years the Spanish Inquisition killed fewer than 2,000 people , 2,000 . The Salem Witch Trials I heard about when I came to America , and then my wife and I a few years ago went to Salem , Massachusetts , it 's a really interesting place -- I do want to report , the witches today are doing great , most of them are tourist guides -- but if you pick up one of their brochures , the number of people killed in the Salem Witch Trials , 19 , 19 . </s>
Now , is that 19 too many ? Yeah , or if you want to add it up , 2,019 . But while the atheists cry inconsolable crocodile tears over the crimes of religion , they ignore the vastly greater crimes of atheism . </s>
Now , am I talking about Stalin in Russia and Mao in China ? Not even really , that 's just the tip of the atheist iceberg . You -- if you dig deeper , there is a massive procession underneath . In the Soviet Union alone , starting with Lenin you continue through Brezhnev , Andropov , Chernenko , a procession of Soviet dictators , but what about Chauchesku and , Fidel Castro , Kim Jong Il , Pol Pot , I mean , Pol Pot is such a junior league atheist people do n't even mention him . And yet in the aftermath of the Vietnam War , his Khmer Rouge regime in the space of about three years managed to kill two million people , two million . </s>
Even bin Laden in his wildest dreams has not even come close , but who should parachute into the discussion at this critical moment but Richard Dawkins in his book , `` The God Delusion , '' and he goes , `` Wait a minute . We 've got to make a crucial distinction here . '' The -- you might 've had some -- a tyrant who killed -- who happened to be atheist , but they did n't kill in the name of atheism . </s>
The Christians killed in the name of Christianity . Now , Richard Dawkins is a respected biologist , and I think here you begin to see the problem , when a biologist is allowed to leave the laboratory . Why ? Because evidently the poor man knows no history , all you have to do is crack open the collected works of Karl Marx , and you will see that the atheism is not incidental , it 's not some add on , it 's intrinsic to the whole ideological scheme , Marx famously calls religion , the opium , a kind of drug of the masses . </s>
And his point is you’ve got to get rid of religion in order to establish the new man and the new Utopia freed from the shackles of traditional religion and traditional morality . </s>
Often when we think of secular society , we think of Europe . But Europe isn’t really secular . Europe is a product of 2,000 years of Jewish and Christian civilization . Even today if there’s a famine in Rwanda , while much of the world ignores it , the European countries , the Western countries begin to send to food and aid , Doctors without Borders , the Red Cross . </s>
My point is this is the result of a religious training and a religious habit of mind that remains . Nietzsche once said that if we get rid of God , we’ve got to get rid of shadows of God . </s>
In other words , the ideas that Judaism and Christianity brought into the West and into the world , those will begin to erode as well . Dostoevsky said a long time ago , “If God is not , everything is permitted.” And Dostoevsky’s point is that when we get rid of transcendence , when we create a world without religion , we license terrible calamities . So , in the names of the thousands and hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions of souls who have died , I would say from their point of view , the world would have been a lot better off if it had religion . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Dinesh D’Souza . And that concludes round one , opening statements of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . We’ll be right back . Okay , so we’re going to do one of our spontaneous bursts of applause by you . </s>
To begin our second round , I just want to allow the crew to remove the lecterns . All right . Let’s all clap . Our motion is “The world would be better off without religion.” </s>
This is a debate from Intelligence Square U.S. We’re at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . I’m John Donvan . We have two teams of two arguing out this motion . One team , A.C. Grayline , Anthony Grayling and Matthew Chapman , arguing the world would be better off without religion . </s>
They make the argument that religion has been burden for mankind , that it imprisons the minds of those who participate in it , keeping them within a narrow range of ideas , discouraged from thinking , believing in things that they say are evidentially not evidential , that are not real , also that religion divides us historically in ways that have had terrible consequences . The team arguing against the motion that the world would be better off without religion , who are saying explicitly the world would be better off -- is better off with religion , Dinesh D’Souza and Rabbi David Wolpe . </s>
They are arguing that a world without religion would be a very , very bleak place , in part because of the absence of the sorts of goods that manifestly are carried out in the name of religion around the world , and that in places where godlessness has been established , terrible things , terrible crimes have been committed in the name of godlessness , or , more accurately , in the absence of the name of God . We’re going to go onto round two now . These are -- this is round where the debaters address one another and also take questions from me and from you in the audience . </s>
We’re going to revisit some of what’s been said already and also get into some new areas . And I want to start with the side arguing for the motion , the side that’s arguing that we would be better off without religion . </s>
What does it say about the many billions of humans who embrace religion that they do so given your argument that it is destructive to them and that it is limiting to them and that there is a delusion in it ? What do you say about them ? Why are they doing that ? Anthony Grayling . Well , first , of course , Matthew is right to point out that the religion that anybody has tends , on the whole -- I mean , in much more than 95 percent of cases to be the religion of your parents . </s>
And so , it’s a traditional thing . People are brought up in the religion of their father , and it’s historical . Can I -- can I just -- I just want to ask you to go closer to the microphone -- and you can address the answer out to the audience . It doesn’t just have to be in my direction . </s>
And if you could start again . But you asked me the question . </s>
I know that . </s>
But know that my eyes are boring into the side of your head . Okay , so I repeat the answer , which is , of course , you know , religion is pervasive in history at its traditional -- it’s handed down from parents to their children so it remains the case that it’s a very potent force in society . But if you look at the trend in the developed and advanced and educated countries of the world , mainly the Western countries , since the 17th and 18th century , enlightenment and the growth of science , you see the numbers are plummeting . They are plummeting even here in the United States of America . You look at the few polling data and it points out to us that the number of people who self-identify has not having a religious commitment or agnostic or atheist is increasing all the time , especially among the young . </s>
So the trends are setting in the right direction . All right . Let me take that to the other side . And in the argument made by Anthony Grayling and also earlier by Matthew Chapman is that there 's a -- that religion kind of gets kids early when -- when they 'll believe anything . And then it 's -- and then it 's set . </s>
And then it 's set and hard to -- hard to move off . And I want you to take that point on . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza : Sure . Remember , we also get kids early with habits like brushing your teeth , learning the mathematical tables . </s>
Now , here is the point . I think that as a practical matter , we all learn our ethical values from our parents . I would -- I learned what I would call crayon Christianity from my parents . But the fact of the matter is that 's my parents ' beliefs . When I became a teenager , when I went to Dartmouth , that set of beliefs got battered , and crayon Christianity became no Christianity at all . </s>
So it was an adult life that I had to go back to the ideas that had been bred in me as a child and ask , which of my parents ' beliefs do I agree with ? But do you think you 're typical ? You 're -- Dinesh D'Souza : I do . You went to Dartmouth . You 're a very bright guy . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza : Well -- And -- and brushing your teeth , those are scientific experiments that have determined -- but they 're arguing a somewhat different point , that there are lots of people who -- who may not be able to do the critical thinking that you see and do -- that you do . Dinesh D'Souza : Well , I think we 're making a deep mistake here because just to say we learned it from our parents misses the thrust of why billions of people in the world continue to do it long into old age . In other words , religion delivers practical benefits . </s>
It gives us the hope of life after death . You might say that 's an illusion , but you do n't know . </s>
None of us knows what 's comes after death . We all have to die in any case . Either we die with despair facing annihilation , or we have the hope of something else . </s>
That 's a practical benefit . Second , religion is a mode of transmission of morality . You might say there are morality that comes through Cont or Nietzsche or Hideger . But no one teaches their kids morality that way . </s>
People learn their morality -- All right . Dinesh , let me bring it over to Matthew Chapman and bring him into this . And if you can respond to some of what you 've heard here . </s>
Well , I just think it 's a distortion of what you actually see in life , which is you see people who grow up in cultures . </s>
They become addicted to their particular religions . They disagree with all kinds of other religions . </s>
Even you , you disagree with -- you started as a Catholic . </s>
You end up as an evangelical . Does that mean that you then say the stuff in the Catholic part of it was actually wrong , and you were mistaken about that ? I think all of this is frankly delusional and that even if you could remove all of the bad things about religion and keep all of the good things in religion , none of which ca n't be performed by people who do n't believe in God because they can . But even if you could remove all of the bad things from religion , and you ended up with a character who is like Father Christmas , a nice harmless sort of person , would you want to find out that the president of the United States was a devout believer in Father Christmas ? Not me . </s>
All right , let me take this -- Let me take this to -- I want to -- I want to take it to David Wolpe because the -- the issue of this -- of whether there 's a credulity here that people believe suggests that people 's minds are n't growing . </s>
So I want to say , first of all , it 's so interesting that the side that 's quoting the Bible is that side and the side that has actually provided evidence of any kind is this side . So let me give you another piece of evidence as opposed to the generalities . In their Encyclopedia of Wars , okay , the Encyclopedia of Wars , Charles Phillips and Allen Axelrod , they chronicle over 1700 serious conflicts throughout history . </s>
Do you want to know what percentage actually reduced to religious wars ? Seven percent . David , David , I -- The reason I 'm -- the reason I 'm saying this is because it 's not about credulity . </s>
No , it 's not about credulity . The idea that people who are religious are religious because of some psychological deficit , but people who are not religious are not religious because they reason their way to the lack of religion , not only slights the idea that religious people are capable of thought , but also tries to sort of railroad into this belief that you should condemn it without actually looking at all the statistics , the ideas , the history that we cited . And that sort of slighting of the religious belief makes me think that your argument might not be as sound as you think it is . A.C. Grayling . Can I come back to that ? </s>
I hear a certain kind of incoherence on the other side there . Firstly , if you 're religious , you live longer , that puzzles me . I mean , is n't heaven meant to be a nice place ? It 's always been -- Most of this was like 800 years old or something like that . </s>
Yeah . And then Dinesh says that one reason why people stay religious into old age is because they 're thinking about life after death . Well , that was Bernie Madoff 's mistake . </s>
He promised returns in this life . So you know , religion . I 'm afraid the things that most people are brought up in a religious tradition , and those people who escape religion do it because they look at the facts , they look at the evidence , they look at the morality . They look at the teachings . They look at the world around them , and they recognize that there is something very divisive and very distorting here . </s>
Look at small children even in kindergarten , all races and ethnicities and backgrounds and classes and religions . They do n't know that . We have to work very , very hard to divide them and tell them what tribe they belong to and what religion they belong to . And that 's where the source of the trouble comes in our world -- </s>
All right , Dinesh D'Souza . -- from division . Dinesh D'Souza to respond . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza : A.C. said earlier that the defining feature of religion is hierarchy and exclusivity . And I think that on both these , he 's giving a very narrow and ethno-centric definition . First of all , Christianity is the only religion in the world that considers another religion , Judaism , to be wholly true . Hinduism considers all other religions to be wholly true . There 's no sense in the Eastern religions of this hierarchy of this exclusivity . </s>
So we 're seeing here not an attack on religion , but on a very slice of religion , perhaps fundamentalist religion . I think the deeper point here is this : And that is that the religious guy and the nonreligious guy are both responding to the world as it is . Charles Darwin became an atheist not because he discovered evolution . </s>
It was n't facts . It was when his daughter , Annie , died . And Charles Darwin said , `` If there 's a hell , lots of the lovely people I know would be in it . I ca n't bear that kind of a doctrine . '' </s>
You , Matthew , in your article in Slate magazine talked about nuns or teachers who beat you on the ankles and people -- people who stuck their hands down your pants . My point is , in many cases , we 're not dealing with facts . We 're dealing with wounded theism . </s>
Many times when we heard the word `` atheism , '' we 're dealing with a person who is angry with God or angry maybe with the representative , the self-appointed representative of God . That 's not real atheism . They too are conducting , if you will , an ideological war , otherwise they would n't -- </s>
All right . Dinesh D'Souza : -- be here . That 's an interesting point . Matthew Chapman , are you angry with God ? How can you be angry with somebody that does n't exist ? </s>
I 'm angry with Dinesh because he 's making these preposterous statements about my -- Dinesh D'Souza : Well , I did n't put my hand down your pants . -- great-great-grandfather -- -- that are simply -- that are simply not true . His atheism did n't come solely from the fact that his daughter died . It was a very slow process of seeing how the theory of evolution was in conflict with the Bible . And I think the point I would make is , let 's give the religious people that at some point in history , religion was helpful , that it did make people do better things . </s>
But that the texts that these things -- that the religions are based upon are archaic , absurd , cruel , open to interpretation . And frankly , there are better ways of conducting yourself in life . </s>
There are . </s>
And people like myself and Antony here , we do n't find a problem with being moral without God . John Donvan : h All right . And I do n't buy in argument that we 've inherited it from Christianity because if you look at the sort of evolutionary world , empathy and cooperation , compassion clearly existed before God decided , for some unknown reason . </s>
Let me -- let me take it to David Wolpe to talk about this question of the text . And you 're in an interesting position because in 2001 you gave a talk in which you actually questioned the literal truth of the exodus story . So you are not -- you are already not tied -- I 'm not a literalist , no . </s>
But what I find very interesting is that the leap that Matthew 's making -- he says these texts have cruel things . There are better ways to behalf . </s>
But we 're asking not would the world be better off if you rewrote the Bible , but would the world be better off without the influence that religion has on religious people . And I tried again and again to say this is what religious people do . This is what religious people do . This is what religious people do only to get back , `` But look at the terrible text . '' And I want to say , in response to what -- to what Anthony said , I have the exact opposite experience . </s>
I actually think that if you believe that people are fundamentally good , and if you leave them alone , they 're just going to be good , then you 've never visited a playground , because my experience is when a new kid comes to the playground , the other kids do n't go , `` Oh , look , a new child . </s>
Let us embrace him and share our toys . '' Actually , children have to be socialized to good . They do . And it takes a lot of work . If any of you are parents , do you have to tell your kid , `` Do n't share so much , do n't be so nice . '' </s>
No , quite the opposite . And that work is difficult work and constant work and that 's what religious communities do . Do they ever do harm ? Of course they sometimes do harm . </s>
Are there texts I do n't like ? Of course , but the coda to this is , this idea that religious people are thoughtless automatons that follow what the text says , does violence to everything I know about religious training , about religious leaders , about religious people , and by the way about the fact that we 're having a debate like this tonight . Let me go to the other -- I would like to -- -- all right , very quickly . </s>
-- because I think what he 's saying is this is the viewpoint of a rabbi who does work in an affluent community in Los Angeles . Both these men are very sophisticated . The people I met in Pennsylvania , who 50 percent of them believe in creationism and are fundamentalists , are people -- they 've seen people -- these people , they ignore . They 're saying we ignore their sophistication . I 'm saying they ignore the fact that most of the world is fundamentalist and takes a barbaric view of many of the text . </s>
And if there were no religion , what would be happening in Pennsylvania ? In other words , what 's the harm in the Pennsylvania situation , where the school board wanted intelligent design taught as an equal alternative to evolution , you 've got to specify what the harm is there . Well , the harm is absolutely enormous , I mean , 50 percent -- I mean , just to be practical about it -- 50 percent of the growth of the American economy since World War II has come from science and technology . And this anti-scientism is gradually eroding America 's ability to produce enterprising , educated -- Okay , I want -- that 's a new point that I want to take to this side , the argument that religious thinking and religious strictures limit science , Galileo into the future . </s>
Go ahead . Dinesh D'Souza . Dinesh D'Souza : First of all , if you want to make a list of the 200 greatest scientists of all time from Newton , Copernicus , Kepler , Pascal , Kasendi , Boyle , the list goes on , you find that the vast , vast majority of them were religious believers . </s>
Moreover , it 's not an accident that science did not develop universally . </s>
It developed in Western civilization . Why is that ? </s>
Because in Western civilization , there is an embedded religious idea , and that is the idea of the rational cosmos . The Muslim philosopher , Iben -- the Muslim philosopher , Alga Zali denies that the universe operates by laws . He says , `` Everything happens because Allah wills it at every given moment , '' that 's why science did n't develop in the Muslim world . It 's the sense of the whimsical , the miraculous universe . </s>
The point I 'm trying to get at here is that on the basis of , I would say , a one percent minority of religious rednecks , we have an indictment of all the world 's religions as a whole . Right . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza : Nothing could be more crude and shameful than to imply that Athens and Jerusalem which have given rise to Western civilization , that have shaped our philosophy , our economy , separation of powers , checks , and balances , when Thomas Jefferson , who -- All right , Dinesh , I want to cut you off to let Anthony Grayling -- Yeah , sorry , I mean that there are two things , Dinesh , with great respect to you , you are the most tremendous rewriter of history I 've ever come across in my life . I mean , once -- you do n't seem to be conscious of the fact that when Christianity became dominant in Europe in about the third , fourth century A.D. it looked at its sundial , the perusal of the second coming of the Messiah had n't happened , they needed some extra ethics . </s>
The ethics of the New Testament and the epistles are very thin , they 're the stuff I talked about earlier , give everything away , do n't get married , do n't bother about tomorrow . </s>
Where did they get it from ? They got it from Greek philosophy . Most of European culture , and that means culture of the West , is deeply rooted in classical antiquity , in the thinking of Socrates , and Aristotle , and the stoics . That is where our European outlook -- our cultural outlook comes from . Conceptions of justice , of ethics , of a democracy , they all come from the pre-Christian state of Europe . </s>
Your -- Christianity was an oriental religion that erupted into Europe and changed the course of European history , and derailed it for over 1,000 years . People could n't build a dome like the Dome of Maxentius in Rome because they 'd lost the understanding of simple engineering . Was n't until Brunelleschi 's Dome in Florence in the 15 -- 16th century that that was possible . So we 're looking at a phenomenon here where religion did to our forefathers , did to the history of our culture exactly what Matthew says it 's doing again to the prospects for science and progress in our -- All right . </s>
David Wolpe . Very briefly , Anthony , I think actually you 're the victim of a very parochial education because long before Christianity , Judaism enunciated all the ideals that you say did not actually come from religion . In 50 BCE , when Hillel was asked to summarize all of Judaism , he said that which is hateful to you , do n't do to others . And the sages of Judaism were killed by the Roman Empire , not be a religious empire , as opposed to Socrates who was killed by the Athenian polity that you idealize . </s>
They killed their own sages . In Judaism , we venerated them . And they’re actually the ones who ceded Christianity and gave us the morality that you claim came from the Stoics . Anthony . Can I tell David just a quick little anecdote about a conversation I had with a cab driver in London . </s>
Cab drivers in London are very interesting folk . </s>
I asked this man if he’d read the Old Testament . He said he hadn’t . I said , “Do you remember any stories from the Old Testament.” </s>
He thought for a moment . He said , “Yep , I remember something about a woman being turned into a pillar of salt , ” and I took this to be evidence of some domestic disorder in his own family and wishful thinking . I said to him , “Do you remember that story , you know , God didn’t like the homosexuals in Sodom so he was going to destroy everybody there ? Somebody pointed out to him that there might be a righteous person . </s>
He sent the angels to tell Lot to get out of the city . The citizens wanted those two angels , the handsome young men . And Lot said to them , ‘You can have my daughters instead.’ </s>
When they finally left the city , what happened to his two daughters ? They didn’t have husbands , so they slept with their father and became the -- </s>
All right , we see where you 're going . I know the story . By the way , actually you also are the victim of an inadequate Biblical education I think because Sodom was not destroyed because of homosexuality . </s>
Read the book of Ezekiel . It was destroyed because of the cruelty of the people of Sodom , their immorality , and I really -- I think with all due respect that to cite London cab drivers , pithy though they may be as the demonstration that Judaism didn’t actually create the morality of the West , may be a little thin . the demonstration . </s>
And Sodom was destroyed no matter what reason you give to it . </s>
I want to go to questions from the audience . I want to move onto your questions and recall that I’d like you to be very terse and to really ask a question that’s on our motion that moves it forward . Before we get to it , get all ready for that , I just want to take one -- move things in one more direction , to this thought . </s>
I want to rephrase what David Wolpe has been saying , is that religion organizes -- religion has the capacity to organize the best in us , to do good things , and to transcend ourselves . And what he paints is a bleak world without that . </s>
So , it’s undeniable in places like Africa , et cetera , that the enormous amount of work is done through organized religion . And that’s on everybody’s mind , so I’d like you to take that on . Well , we can share it . But most people are religious , so it’s not surprising that most people who are out there doing good things are religious . It’s the same argument I would make about scientists . </s>
Most scientists were Christians . Well , most everybody was Christian . So , of course , most of the scientists were Christians . So you’re saying there’s no cause and effect between -- </s>
I don’t think so . There’s lots and lots of people who do good things and organize -- I’ll challenge that on the basis of this book right here by the sociologist Arthur Brooks . </s>
It’s called “Who Really Cares ? ” </s>
And it’s the careful study of philanthropy in America . </s>
So it’s comparing like with like . It divides America into four groups : religious conservatives , religious liberals , secular conservatives , and secular liberals . And it looks at generosity , not just in terms of money , but also in terms of time , and not to religious causes but to so-called secular causes . Turns out that the most charitable people in America , by far , are the religious conservatives . The second most charitable are the religious liberals . </s>
The third most charitable are the secular conservatives , and the last are the secular liberals . Now , what’s particularly poignant about this is the secular liberals in America are the richest . </s>
They earn the most money , but they give away the least . So it is not the case that this is a generic matter of people who happen to be religious . The point which David Sloan Wilson made in a recent book is that evolution narrows the circle of our sympathies to our kins or to people from whom we can get something . But when you do things in service to God , you’re much more likely to help the stranger or the outsider . All right . </s>
A very quick response from the other side if you want , Anthony Grayling . Okay , I just want to make the point that there are plenty of non-religious people involved in charitable endeavors and they don’t stay on afterwards because they don’t have an extra agenda . And I just want to quote to you -- </s>
You mean proselytization ? Yeah exactly . </s>
And I don’t -- I just want to -- Anthony , can you be explicit about that , yeah . </s>
Yes , sir , because I don’t think that they’re staying on because they haven’t got anything to proselytize about . They don’t want a return for their investment . George Bernard Shaw said -- very , very quick quote -- he said when he gave up religion -- escaped religion as a teenager , he said that moment was the moment when I felt the dawning of moral passion because people who don’t take a box out of the frozen food warehouse of morality , you know , there it all is , are people who have go to think about their responsibilities and about their relationships to other people . They 've got to be people who think about the diversity , how different people are from one another . </s>
You know the golden rule , `` Do unto others as you would have them do unto you , '' Jules Burnshaw said , no , under no circumstances should you do to others what you 'd like them to do to you because they may not like it . And that 's a very good insight . It means see them for what they are in their individuality and personality and base your morality on a genuine understanding of what it is to be human in a human world . </s>
All right . I 'm going to go to questions . </s>
And if I turn down your question , please do n't take it personally . I -- I -- it 'd just be my judgment that it might not be on point . Right in the middle there , yeah . Yeah . </s>
You just pointed to yourself . </s>
And if you could stand up and tell us your name . Hi . </s>
My name is Elizabeth , and my question to those who are for the motion is , how are the harms of religion different from those of nationalism or racism ? And for those against the motion , how are the good things from religion different from the good things that come from secular charities or community organizations or -- Okay . </s>
-- being involved with your family ? Okay . I 'm going to -- good questions , which are really one question that I think we all see . And I will let this side go first . This side for the motion . </s>
Matthew Chapman . Well , I -- I -- I think the difference is that even the mistakes of people who are acting out of nonreligious motives are mistakes based on reason . And that most of the horrors of religion are mistakes based out of superstitious fear and delusion . And I can not see how delusion can be healthy to a society . I just ca n't -- I ca n't see it . </s>
Not all of these religions can be true because they all contradict each other . </s>
So some of them are delusional . How can this be healthy ? It 's divisive . It 's nonsensical . </s>
And I am not saying that atheism has come up with the perfect solution . </s>
But there has to be a better way than this . Do you know what it is ? I think it 's secular humanism . It 's atheism . Okay . </s>
All right . David Wolpe , do you want to respond ? You can either respond to what 's just been said or to the question which was a variation . I -- I mean , the -- the frustration that I -- that I repeatedly am having in this debate is that we 're arguing theory against the world . The world is that there are millions and millions and millions of people who be -- who , by their own testimony , although the other side may not believe it , say they 're doing good because they believe there is a transcendent purpose in their doing good . </s>
Therefore , they 'll do it tomorrow , next week , next month , next year . </s>
It 's not a club that 's going to dissolve . They 're not going to go away . They 're not going to stop doing it . And they 're going to teach their children to do it . </s>
And what we hear on the other side , to a great extent is , that 's bad because it 's delusional . And the question is not actually would the world be better off if everybody had the same scientific ideology ? </s>
Would that be a better world ? The world -- the question is , what would it be like if religion were gone ? What would it be if you just , all of a sudden , sucked that motivation from these countless people who do good ? And that 's what I want to know . I 'd like to propose an -- </s>
Matthew Chapman . -- experiment , if I may , which is I would ask the audience , how many of you out there do good things , do charity , visit people in hospitals , take care of friends ? And could I see a show of hands of anyone who 's involved in charitable endeavors , helping people , taking care of animals , giving money to charity , whatever it is . </s>
I hope the rapture happens right now because -- There we have -- </s>
-- I 'm going to know who 's telling the truth . Now -- now I would like to see a show of hands of how many of those people did that because they feared religion or religious authority . Feared ? Well , or were -- or were -- </s>
Here 's -- here 's my question . </s>
Okay . I have n't -- no , I have n't -- I have n't finished yet . Hold on for a second , David . I have n't finished yet . Okay . </s>
Or -- I mean , we saw no hands there , or who did it because they thought that by doing good action it would get them into heaven . </s>
Let 's see a show of hand on that . </s>
Did n't say that , either . Now -- David , David , David -- Now let 's see a show of hands from people who do these good things simply because they have a human empathy towards people who are suffering . </s>
I think we have a biased pollster here in the audience , you know . I do n't think so . </s>
I mean -- </s>
All right . We get it . </s>
-- people do good things -- Let David respond to that . David Wolpe . -- other reasons than religion -- Matthew , let David come back . </s>
-- the majority here . </s>
The reason -- the reason that that -- the reason that that 's not persuasive , shall we say , is first of all , very few religious people will tell you it 's to get into heaven . </s>
It 's because it 's what God expects them to do . </s>
That 's first of all . In other words , you do it because other human beings are created in the image of God . </s>
And if you take that out , then our link is a species link . But if we 're all children of the same God , then you are my brother and sister , and that 's why you do it . It 's different . It 's not because you are afraid of God . And second , people 's self-reported charitable doings , although obviously everyone here is completely honest . </s>
People 's self-reported charitable doings are a lot less reliable than survey after survey after survey . </s>
And the way that -- that the surveys were answered by Putnam , by Brooks , by Koenig , by respected sociologists , the way that he answered them is by asking you to raise your hand . Now , I want to ask you seriously , how many of you believe that all these sociologists and psychologists are cooking the data , and how many -- you do n't have to raise your hand . And how many of you believe that whether you like religion or not , the truth is that it does make people much more inclined to be self-sacrificing in this world . And if you do n't believe it , then all I can say is , I know a world without religion that you can look at . I 'm from that world . </s>
It 's called Hollywood . </s>
All right . Let 's go to another question . Right down in the front row there . No , gentleman , the gentleman . You 'll probably notice a male-female pattern in my selection , so -- so the next question you know who should raise their hands . </s>
Thank you so much for this evening . I think it 's a great debate , and I truly enjoy it . I am Muslim , okay . </s>
So definitely , my question will go to you guys . Great point that you make , but I will make it quick . The thing is that religion is really the question for me today because is it the misuse of religion that 's really bring all this drama and all the chaos that we really talk about , or is it really religion itself ? Because if I have a weapon , right , and I use it against you , and in this day today , we go to court , I will take the person on his character and take him to court and take him to jail , not the companies that make the weapons or the owner of the company . But I will take the person on his own act . </s>
So it could really -- I think you started with the question . Okay . </s>
Which was , is it -- is it religion , or is it the way that some people are using it or misusing it ? That 's a terrific question . Let 's go to this side . </s>
Matthew Chapman . Well , I mean , that , to me -- that , to me , is the entire problem . </s>
If you look at any religious text , it can be interpreted in any way and give you an excuse to do anything . These gentleman here , I 'm sure they 're very nice people , and they look at it in the most benign way . I 've heard Rabbi Wolpe over there say that the whole -- the whole process of religion is that you take all these complicated books , and you filter them through human consciousness and out comes something that makes sense . I agree . </s>
And when you filter them out , what you get is humanism . Jefferson did the same thing with the Bible . He took out everything that he thought was contemptible or had nothing to do with the origins of religion . He got 48 pages . I say you could bring it down to one page that said -- or one phrase which would be `` Do unto others as you do -- as you would have done to you . '' </s>
It is as simple as that . And all of those texts -- So Matthew , your answer to his -- </s>
-- . </s>
Your answer to his question is , it 's not just how religion gets used . </s>
The problem is religion itself . The problem is the ancient text that are infinitely interpretable for any purpose . Okay . </s>
Dinesh , do you have somewhere new to take this response ? Dinesh D'Souza : Well , yeah . First of all , Jefferson , who was a man of the enlightenment , not a very devout Christian , as you point out correctly . But when Jefferson was asked , `` What is the source of our rights ? '' he could have said the social contract . He could have said the enlightenment . </s>
But no , he said it 's the creator . He could think of only one source . One word about the texts . I think the point that Rabbi Wolpe and I are stressing is that the way to interpret the text is to look and see whether the people who revered the text do the things in the text . </s>
So , for example , he read a passage from Deuteronomy about chopping off people 's arms or removing their genitals . So I ask you , how many religious people are going around without arms or genitals ? No one who is Jewish or Christian reads the texts that way . So there 's a form of , you might say , atheist fundamentalism in taking the text in so literal a way that no Christian -- I mean , there was a debate that between Paul and the early apostles about which aspects of the ancient law should apply to Christians . It was settled 2,000 years ago that Christians would not follow the Old Testament in a literal way . </s>
And even the guys in Dover are n't doing that . So in a way , I think these guys are charging an imaginary dragon . Okay . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza : You 're trying to hold us accountable to texts which were , in a sense , not taken as literal 2,000 years ago . In the fourth -- And we have . </s>
I want to move on . </s>
And fourth row , you can -- in your closing remarks , you can -- My question is a little bit more broad . It 's that , is n't religion basically a fear of death and ultimately your ultimate judgment and the selfish belief that humans are so important that we should have the right to live forever ? Well , you guys are going to say yes to that , I 'm pretty sure . So I 'm going to go over this way . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza . Dinesh D'Souza : I think your question is echoing an argument in Sigmund Freud that religion is wish fulfillment . </s>
We all -- but life is tough , we have diabetes , we have the gravedigger , we would like to have another life , and so religion is made up to accommodate that wish . Now , I think that actually that theory does n't square with what religion actually holds , and here 's why . Certainly it explains heaven . </s>
Heaven is a good example of wish fulfillment . But remember that all of the major Abrahamic religions also have hell . Now , think about that . </s>
Hell is a lot worse than diabetes . </s>
Hell is a lot worse than death . Why would we make that stuff up ? </s>
The bottom line I 'm trying to make is that that diagnosis of religion as expressing wish fulfillment runs headlong into the actual facts that religious people actually sometimes fear a fate far worse than anything that life can offer them . Okay , let 's go to gentleman -- yeah , I 'm looking right at you , thank you . </s>
If you can rise a mic will come to you . If there 's anybody in the part of the auditorium that 's not lit , I want to confess I ca n't see you , if you really truly want to have a question -- ask a question , if you come down the steps a little bit and I 'll be able to see you , I 'll try to call on you . I ca n't promise it , but I 'll try to call on you . Sir , go ahead . </s>
Dinesh , this is specifically for you . Can you tell us who you are , please ? Robert Shillman . Thank you . </s>
How could you possibly give a speech leaving out the Holocaust , Bosnia , Turkey , and the Armenians , how could you quote that ridiculous book which has been disproved when you take out the money that has given to the religion all of the numbers shift the other way . You 're sitting here systematically making up statistics to try and convince us that it 's a good thing . And I 'd love just your response . Okay , I 'm going to -- Dinesh , I do n't -- I do n't want you to -- -- I just think that 's going to turn into a circle that does n't get us further on our motion , so I 'm going to move on to a different question . </s>
Really ? Okay , let 's do that -- can we do that show of hand things -- the show of hands thing ? </s>
All right . </s>
Make it very quick though , please . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza : I want to focus on the Holocaust . I would recommend to you this book , `` Hitler 's Table Talk . '' It 's edited by the prominent historian , Hugh Travaroper , and it constitutes direct notes of Hitler 's comments authorized by Bohrman between 1941 and 1945 . In the early 1930s when Hitler was coming to power , he wanted to win over the Bavarian Catholics and the Lutherans in Germany and so he invented what he called a Nazi Christ , not a Christ who was killed but a Jew killer . And he tried to sell that to the churches which did n't go for it . </s>
This book records page after page of Hitler 's loathing and hatred for Christianity . He regarded the church as the most dangerous opposition to the Nazi regime , and I could read for an hour quotations from Hitler 's mouth about his hatred for Christianity . My point is what the atheists will put up on their websites are quotations from the early 1930s , the Mein Kampf where Hitler says , `` I 'm doing the lord 's work . '' This was part of a propaganda campaign to win over the churches that was unsuccessful . Hitler was a hater of Christianity . </s>
I 've never called Hitler an atheist , he was a certain kind of a pagan . Okay , okay , all right , everybody happy ? All right , good . I just do n't feel that it really moved our topic about whether religion is good or bad . </s>
Ma'am , sitting on the stairs because you came all the way down -- Which one ? </s>
Sure , yeah , yeah . All right , hi , my name is Katherine , and it seems today that there seems to be a disconnect between the two sides . One side argues that religion only creates good and perpetuates charity and civic engagement while the other says that it 's a system of discrimination and religious doctrine creating hate . </s>
I have a feeling that the truth is somewhere in the middle . </s>
However , my question is this , how do you get the benefits of civic engagement without the discrimination , or is it even possible to disentangle the two within religious doctrine ? Is that more of a question to this side ? </s>
Sounds like it . Sure . Sounds like it , yeah . </s>
David Wolpe . Well , I mean , it is certainly true that good and bad are mixed in every society , in every organization , in every human being , and the question you ask is a metaphysical question , that is , `` How do you get only the good and not the bad ? '' </s>
I do n't know that , that 's possible to do in anything . There 's no charity that has not been subject to corruption , and to misappropriation of funds , and to people doing cruelty , and I do n't know that you can wash religion away , and actually the essence of the debate is does religion do bad sometimes , absolutely , but if you measure the good in which religion does in the world and , as I said , the unadvertised good , the small good , the constant good , then what do you get in a world without it ? And the essence of the debate is whether , in fact , that world’s going to better or worse . </s>
I think it’s almost undebatable . Any response from this side on that ? Yeah , I think the response is that you have to notice that most of our -- most of the advance countries of the world are secular constitutionally , like this one , or functionally secular like my own United Kingdom . And the point about those societies is that they organize welfare , education , defense , infrastructure , and they do this not in the name of one or another religion but in the name of society generally . </s>
So when you look at the benefits , you look at the rational application of our ideas about how a society should flourish and advance and what the needs are of the members of that society , the post- enlightenment world , the world since the 18th century , the world which has been putting to work the ideas of scientific rationality has made a vast improvement to the lives of most individual people . When you think of the poverty and you think of the ill health and you think of the divisiveness of societies before that time and compare them to the society of today -- and notice this . In every city of the world , there are millions of acts of personal kindness and cooperation between people , far outweighs all the conflict and difficulty there is in the world . And it has nothing to do with their ideologies or religions or anything else . </s>
It’s just a fact about us . As social animals , we need one another and we care about one another . Here’s a very simple example . You’re walking down the street , so you see somebody ahead of you . A big pile of bricks on a wall are just about to topple on that person’s head . </s>
What do you do ? </s>
Your instinct is not to say this is going to be interesting . You instinct is to call out to them and say , “Watch out ! ” </s>
And you do it not because you’re an evangelical or a Jew or a Muslim but because you’re a human being and that’s another human being . All right . Another question . I would like to add though , I think -- Matthew Chapman . </s>
I have to say that secular people advertise and religious people don’t . Religion is a constant process or advertising . Every good deed religious people do is taken along with a banner showing whatever religion did . Doctors without Borders makes no claim to having any religion , no without any -- nor does it claim to be -- I mean , do you really think that accusation is fair ? </s>
Can I do a poll now of the group ? </s>
Let me ask you , how many of you had heard of the largest aid organization of the world that I mentioned at the beginning ? How many of you had heard of it ? Now how many of you had heard of Doctors without Borders ? I rest my case . </s>
All right . Let’s move -- can I take a poll on should we stop doing polls ? Show of hands . </s>
Sir , you’re up . Sure , thank you . This is a question for Matthew -- Could you tell us your name , please ? </s>
Frank Roberts . Thank you . This is a question for Matthew and Professor Grayling . For the question of the evening is would the world be better off without religion , but my fear is that the question is in of in itself somewhat disingenuous because it keeps it -- religion seems to be this theoretical thing up here . </s>
And I’m wondering if we can ground it to more practical examples . So my question is would you be willing to say in public that the world would be better off without Jews , or the world would be better off without the Civil Rights Movement , a movement that we know was based in a kind of radical black Christianity . So , my question to you is , again , rather than asking would the world be better off without religion , is it more so a question of whether or not we think that religion is problematic or has been misappropriated , et cetera , et cetera , et cetera , but it seems like the very question of whether the world is better off is problematic ? </s>
Wait , can you zero in -- because I know that you can because -- zero in to the one point that you want to ask . The one point that I want to ask is , is the very term of the question somewhat disingenuous because we know that we would never say that the world would be better off without religious people -- All right . So you’re asking would the world be better off without religious people , and is that what you’re arguing ? No , I think we’re arguing the world would be better off without religion . </s>
We’re -- the point is -- But I think the point of his question is that -- </s>
I understand his question exactly , and it’s a deep point of principle that in all these kinds of debates , it’s not about individuals . </s>
This is not about people . This is not about human beings . </s>
We understand why human beings are religious . They’re brought up to be religious , or they’re not told enough about the history of their religion . They’re given the most updated version of it , and so on . So it’s not about attacking individuals . It’s about attacking ideas . </s>
It’s about attacking ideologies . </s>
It’s about attacking conceptual frameworks which act like spectacles that make people see things in a particular way . That’s the argument . It’s not saying that we would like all Jewish people or Muslim people or Christian people taken as individuals not to be there . No . What we would like them is to be free from those distorting ideologies . </s>
We’re being -- I want to point out we’re being live-streamed also on Slate.com . And we 've asked viewers and readers of Slate to submit questions . And I have one that I find quite interesting to put to the side arguing for world with religion . </s>
Dan Riley in Portland , Oregon , says , `` Would a world in which Hinduism or Islam or Norse paganism were the only religions still be preferable to a world without religion ? '' in other words , he 's kind of -- if there were n't Christianity and Judaism , but there were one religion motivating people , but it was n't your favorite . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza . Dinesh D'Souza : I 'll make my own case hard by looking solely at Islam because it is such a controversial subject in our world today . I would submit that the world would be vastly worse -- the Muslim world would be vastly worse if it was n't for Islam . Let 's look at why that 's the case . First of all , you have to look at what was there in the Bedouin culture before Mohammed . </s>
Rape , pillage , concubinage . Mohammed actually was a moderate in limiting the number of wives to four and by basically saying that you had to treat the four wives equally , giving them all the same gifts and so on . Mohammed essentially ensured that the entire Muslim world , for the most part , you 'd have people with one wife . Polygamy is very rare in the Muslim world for that reason . So the bottom line of it is that Islam was a vastly civilizing force , not to mention the introduction of a cosmopolitan civilization with a history , a philosophy and a distinctive architecture , not to mention great Islamic philosophers and thinkers . </s>
Even the great Jewish scholar Bernard Lewis has a great appreciation for the civilizing influence -- </s>
All right . Dinesh D'Souza : -- of Islam in the world . A clear answer to that question , so I want to go to the other side to see if you respond to that . Well , I just -- </s>
Anthony Grayling . -- have in mind what Goutama Buddha said to his followers . He said , `` Do n't make me a god , and do n't turn this into a religion . It 's a philosophy . </s>
It 's a philosophy of compassion . It 's a philosophy of authenticity . It 's a philosophy about living respectfully and responsibly . </s>
Do n't make it a religion , and do n't turn me into a god . '' And the thing is that even if it was just the Norse gods and paganism or the Olympian gods , somehow or other , it would cease being that thing that the Buddha wanted a philosophy to be , and it would become something that admitted , you know , all its extremes , including the hypocrites on one side and the extremists on the other . Okay . </s>
Ma'am , you were patient before when it was almost your turn . So try again . There is the mic . </s>
And if you could stand up and tell us your name , please . Hi . My name is Meitha , and I 'm a student at NYU . My question is sort of a clarifying question for both sides . </s>
You 've been referring to religion and to the acts of religious people . I 'm wondering if you see religion as a social organization versus religion as a personal individual instance of faith as distinct and having distinct effects , or do you see them as inseparable ? And can I refine your question to take it more to our motion ? And you tell me if this is fair . </s>
In a way , are you asking , should we get rid of the organizations and the churches and the synagogues and the panoply and the various kinds of hats that different faiths wear to establish themselves and to promulgate their rules ? Is that what you mean ? Essentially , yes , yes . Okay . </s>
I want to ask the side arguing for a world without religion if that 's what you 're talking about . Are you talking about -- </s>
-- yes , I think -- -- the organization . I think we were thinking about more or less organized collective practice of doctrine and morality . I mean , people do -- the thing about the word `` religion '' it 's like sort of grandmother 's underpants . </s>
You know , it 's huge and baggy and saggy . It 's got so many things in it . We talk about football , is this religion or tennis is our religion . </s>
And so our meaning is something that obsesses you and takes you over . </s>
The idea of one person believing that there are fairies at the bottom of the garden , and that that 's person 's religion is a bit of a stretch of the word . You want to look at the paradigm . </s>
And the paradigms are Judeas and the Christianity and Islam and Hinduism . All right . </s>
And they are collective practices . </s>
Is there a religion without the organization , Rabbi Wolpe ? David Wolpe . No . Okay . </s>
I mean , there is personal religious experience , but there -- but what we 're talking about today is the social organization of religion and what religion does in the world , not so specifically what it does for individuals . So I would -- Okay . </s>
Sir , right down in the front row , plaid shirt . Thank you . My name is Mike . I -- approaching the holidays , and we 're talking a lot about charity . </s>
And the argument you are making is that religion is very charitable . Charities are often scrutinized because of their overhead . I 've -- I 've been to the Vatican . </s>
And -- How do you reconcile the -- the obvious -- Plunder . -- fluid of funds that are being collected versus what is given out . And to be honest , if I -- how do you -- how would you convince me to give my money to you when I can give it to charities that are -- </s>
I 'm not going to give it to the Vatican , I promise . -- charities without as much overhead . </s>
But David Wolpe , I think the question they 're saying that religions can get very involved in earthly things and bog down in the -- or Dinesh , do you want to take the question ? Yeah . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza : I think in the case of the Vatican , the wealth of the Vatican is in priceless treasures , tapestries , the ceiling of the Sistine chapel , art . Now , let 's remember -- let 's remember -- hold on a second . </s>
It 's not the Vatican 's bank balance . It 's the Vatican 's treasures . </s>
And let 's remember that it was popes , the Medici popes and so on , who commissioned those paintings . If it was n't for Catholicism , we would n't have the Sistine chapel . </s>
Not only that -- not only that , but in a study of achievement , the social scientist Charles Murray asked this question : Why , at the top of the Gothic Cathedral are there gargoyles that have been detailed and carved in a way that no one can see them ? And when the people who did those were asked why they were doing it when no one could see it , they said , we are carving for the eyes of God . The point being that transcendence introduces a new perspective . Subspecie eternitus . </s>
The perspective of eternity . And so in a sense , your orientation is different , you act differently . And I 'm not defending accumulations of wealth . </s>
I -- I concede , religion , like any human institution is susceptible to corruption , a little bit like politics or anything else . But I 'm saying on the balance , I think it would be wrong to think that we would be better off as a civilization as a culture , it 's not all Athens . All right . Dinesh D'Souza : It 's a combination of Athens and Jerusalem . Let me take the other side on that question as a balance . </s>
Anthony Grayling . The church commissioned a lot of art because it had the money . </s>
And even artists have to eat . And will notice that after the medieval period , the time when the great Gothic Cathedrals were built , soaring up to heaven with their wonderful spires and crockets , that was a time when people were taught that this life is short and nasty and brutish , and you 've got to hang in there . And if you did n't sin too much , you might have a bit of a shorter time in purgatory . And the Renaissance , the rediscovery of classical antiquity and its love of things human and things natural reintroduced not just devotional art but landscapes , picnics , portraits of ordinary people , paintings of still lives , a celebration of this world and all the joy and pleasure that there is to be had in this world , a humanistic perspective . Was it not Thomas Hobbes who said life was nasty , brutish and short ? </s>
It was n't a religious . It was a philosopher . </s>
I was quoting him . Yes . One more question , right in the center there . Microphone will come in . </s>
All over the United States today as far as I can tell , we 're seeing churches -- the organized religious institutions shutting down or closing down or contracting , in particular churches and synagogues , as far as I can see personally , in great numbers . Does that bespeak , in your view , and in your view , a -- a decline in the views of Americans towards religion as something that they do not want in this country ? So I -- in other words , are Americans beginning to vote with the other side more . Should I take a poll ? No , no , no , no . </s>
Good one . The -- look , in -- David Wolpe . In survey after survey after survey , Americans still pronounce themselves overwhelmingly religious , overwhelmingly religious , 80 percent , 90 percent . It is -- it 's certainly true . </s>
And by the way , and do n't discount economic downturn because that also has a profound effect on religious institutions and other nonprofits as it does on the -- on the rest of the economy . I think that you find both trends at the same time . I think that this is a complicated -- you need Balanshine to choreograph this . It 's complicated . At the same time as people 's religion is still high , their sense of religious affiliation and how they want to express their religion shifts very much . </s>
And so I do n't think that you necessarily are seeing a decline in people 's sense that there 's something transcendent , something greater than themselves . But some organized religions , and not all , Mormonism is growing , some evangelical groups are growing , some religions but not all are declining . Depugh reported that 10 percent of the American population is made up of former Catholics , which I find astounding . That is astounding . </s>
Always I -- Are they Jewish now , are they -- </s>
-- they have all that unbridled guilt running around in this society as well . Maybe I should do the Vatican -- Dinesh D'Souza . </s>
Dinesh D'Souza : Well , I do think it 's -- there was an expectation in the '60s and '70s that the world was becoming secular . Europe was seen as being the automatic vanguard of this and the assumption was that as people become more affluent and educated they will automatically become more secular . </s>
It 's turned out not to be the case . America has not gone the way of Europe , and in fact if you look at any other culture , we 're not seeing this automatic secularization . </s>
If you meet a Hindu Ph.D. and a Hindu janitor they 're just as likely to be religious . There 's no difference . Same in Islam . </s>
So I think that it is the disproof of the secular assumption that has in a sense brought out this aggressive new atheism because the atheists thought they were winning anyway , they were winning by default . I think the European case is anomalous . It was not an attack on religion . It was an attack historically on an oppressive alliance between throne and altar . It was a political rebellion against a particular manifestation of religion in that society and the rest of the world is not going that way at all . </s>
Matthew Chapman , is the advance of atheism or actually a bit of a retreat ? </s>
I -- sadly I do n't see much of an advance in atheism , and as for the churches emptying out , I think it 's rather like the corner stores being taken over by Walmart . </s>
You have the little churches and then you have the big mega-church . And you have churches now where 20,000 people go to pray , evangelical Christian . So you know I 'm sure there 's some diminution of religious attendants but I do n't see a huge surge of atheism unfortunately . </s>
Okay , and Anthony Grayling . I think Dinesh might be guilty of a tiny bit of wishful thinking there because the trend is towards more secularism . In fact , what 's happened since 9/11 when the very violent religious activism brought religion back into everybody 's point of focus again , is that the volume has gone up . People think that religion is resurging but actually it 's because the volume has gone up in the debate . Literally thousands , literally thousands of books of a religious nature are published every year in the United States of America and in Britain . </s>
You do n't have to walk into a Barnes and Noble to see shelf after shelf of them . About half a dozen books which is Dawkins and Christopher Hitchins and Sam Harris and Dan Dente , about half a dozen books have been published attacking religion and putting the atheist case , and all hell breaks loose . But by the way hell was sufficiently banned by the Episcopalian church -- -- back in the 1920s . I do n't know whether you know this but they 're trying to reinvent themselves , but anyway it broke loose because half a dozen books had come out attacking the religious standpoint . And what had happened was this , before 9/11 religion went sort of by default . </s>
If I met a religious person , I would you know pussyfoot around , few eggshells . Somebody once said , you meet a Christian , it 's like meeting somebody who 's had a recent death in the family , which is a bit sort of apropos . So you would n't say anything -- and they probably at a dinner party would n't come out with their religious mission statements . Anthony . </s>
But after 9/11 they did start to do it . The gloves have come off . The debate is now out in the open . </s>
And that 's why it all sounds so noisy . </s>
And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . And here 's where we are . We are about to hear brief closing remarks from each debater in turn . </s>
The closing remarks will be two minutes each . </s>
This is their last chance to change your minds . Remember , after this we 're going to ask you to vote again . And very quickly we 'll have the results in a couple of minutes to declare our winner . On to round three , closing statements by each debater in turn . Our motion is this , `` The world would be better off without religion . '' </s>
Here to speak against the motion in his closing remarks , David Wolpe , rabbi of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles , California . I 'm not going to read you from the article in Skeptic Magazine that appeared in the most recent Skeptic Magazine which is as anti-religious a magazine as you can find saying that it is not possible to sustain that religion causes violence in the world , that , that is in fact not true and none of the statistics support it . </s>
But I do encourage you to take a look and read it and instead I 'm going to end with a story . I 'm a rabbi . So Rabbi Zugogrin was a rabbi in England for many years but he and his father were in Auschwitz when he was a child . </s>
And Hanukkah came around . And his father took the precious margarine ration and instead of using it for food he used it to light the Hanukkah candle . And his son protested and said how can you do this ? Do n't you understand that this is food ? </s>
And his father said to him , “Listen , my child , we have learned that you can go three weeks without eating . You can go three days without drinking , but you can not go three minutes without hope.” Now we’ve been accused of being too sophisticated to participate in this debate . </s>
Right . </s>
Real religious people are simple-minded . But I want to tell you that there are people all over this world , who , whether you think of them as simple-minded or not , the hope of their lives , the purpose of their lives , the good that they do is dependent not in fact on evolutionary pressures alone but on that candle , on the idea that God not threatens them , not is going to send them to hell , but that God created them in God’s own image , that they are precious , that they are sacred , and so are other human beings . And they wouldn’t live three minutes without that hope . And if you vote for the motion , then you’re suggesting that the world would be better if the hope were taken away from them . It isn’t , and you shouldn’t . </s>
Thank you , David Wolpe . Our motion is “The world would be better off without religion , ” and here to speak in support of the motion , A.C. Grayling , philosopher and author of the good book , “A Humanist Bible.” Thank you . It seems very unkind to say that , but alas , it’s just basically true that the religious outlook on the world has its roots , its origins in the beliefs , the superstitions of illiterate goatherds who lived up to 3,000 years ago . And however much religion reinvents itself and however much it tries to make us forget its history and however much it obscures the fact that it depends upon proselytizing very small children for its survival , despite all that , we have an opportunity to think again and afresh and to recognize that in order to live with the kind of hope , with the kind of responsibility , with the kind of love for our neighbor , which is essential for a world of peace . </s>
We’ve got to do that hard work of choosing our morality , choosing our ethics , thinking about the principles of which we live , not borrowing it , not inheriting it , not having to conform to a set of doctrines about these things and a set of rituals which people very , very , very long time ago depended upon to do their thinking for them , but to think afresh , start again , and look at this world as a place where reason and human experience have to be our best , because they are in fact our only guides . Thank you , A.C. Grayling . Our motion is “The world would be better off without religion.” And here to summarize his position against the motion , Dinesh D’Souza , president of the King’s College in New York . Dinesh D'Souza : Rabbi Wolpe and I have been laboring under a tremendous disadvantage in this debate . </s>
Both our opponent have a British accent . </s>
Now , I was raised in India , and I come from a small part of India called Goa , which was a Portuguese colony for many years . And I’d always assumed that my Christianity was the product quite honestly of the Portuguese Inquisition . The Portuguese came to India with a sword in one hand and a Bible in the other . And lots of people converted . They were extremely persuasive . </s>
So I’m very alert to the dangers of religion . On the other hand , I once asked my grandfather , a historian , about this . </s>
And he said that the fact of the matter was that tons of Indians flung themselves into the arms of the missionaries . They wanted to convert . </s>
Why ? And my grandfather’s answer was that if you look at history , it was because of the ancestral -- not religious , but cultural caste system . Most of the Indians were relegated to the lower caste . And the fact of the matter is that if you were at the bottom , an untouchable , let’s say , there was no way to get out . There was no way to move up . </s>
No amount of merit could help you . And so , even though the missionaries might have been greedy and irredentist , the fact that they preached an idea of universal brotherhood , of love , of compassion , inspired people , ennobled their lives . </s>
And that’s why they became Christians . A world without religion would in fact be a grimmer , harsher , meaner world . Religion , for all its flaws , gives us a kinder and gentler world . </s>
And that’s why it’s better to have a world with religion in it . Thank you . Thank you , Dinesh D’Souza . Our motion , “The world would be better off without religion , ” and here to summarize his position in support of this motion , Matthew Chapman , writer and co-founder of Science Debate . The world would be better off without religion because it is better off without religion . </s>
If religion made people behave better , markers of social dysfunction , drug addiction , ignorance , teen pregnancies , violent crime would be much lower in highly religious societies . In fact , the opposite is true . </s>
To quote my friend , Austin Dacey , `` In post Christian Europe , entire nations have been plunked into endemic health , sky rocketing education and hopelessly low rates of violent crime . '' This was a disadvantage to the English . And I 'm not . </s>
I 'm American . Forgive me for using America by way of comparison . I am an American . I love America . </s>
However , 90 percent of Americans believe in God . But we have by far the largest prison population on earth . Drug addiction is widespread . </s>
Gun violence is grotesque . </s>
Our education system produces kids whose math and science skills are far lower than in secular countries while our rate of teen pregnancy is far higher . And in a country so rich and Christian , it 's amazing how many people live in abject poverty . </s>
Religion is a rational , morally confusive and -- confusing and divisive . It still exposes young children to the ghastly concept of hell . It still denigrates women . It still fosters homophobia . And `` religious '' gave us 9/11 . </s>
Making no reference to God , science has , among many other things , rid us of the plagues , smallpox and polio , dramatically reduced infant mortality , doubled the average length of a burdened life and is coming to understand how the brain works , including its capacity for empathy and moral decision making . All this progress , all this beautiful knowledge , all this alleviation of human suffering in 100 years . Religion has had thousands of years to prove its supernatural effectiveness . It has n't . </s>
We think it 's time to try a safer and more enlightened way . </s>
So I hope you will support our position that the world will be better off without religion . Thank you , Matthew Chapman . And that concludes our closing statements . And now it 's time to decide -- to decide which side you feel argued best . Let me just say that again so that it comes out . </s>
And now it 's time to find out which side you feel argued best . We 're going to ask you to again to go to the key pads at your seat and to vote on which argument you felt was better presented . Push number one if you are with this team , the team that 's arguing that `` the world would be better off without religion , '' number two if you 're with the team that argued against that proposition and number three if you remain or became undecided in the course of the debate . </s>
And we 'll lock those in . Ignore the other keys , and you can correct your vote , as I said earlier . And we 'll have the results practically instantaneously . Our producer , Kris Kamikawa , is backstage working on them and will bring them out to me . </s>
So before we move forward , I just want to thank -- I want to thank our debaters for the quality of our argument and the spirit of fairness that they brought to this . </s>
And I really feel that they might not have agreed with each other , but they heard etch other , and that 's the essence of what we 're trying to do here . So thank you for that . And I -- I also want to say that the questions that we got tonight were some of the best we 've ever had in a debate . </s>
The question from Slate , from everybody here , even the gentleman with the question that I wanted to veto . The audience 's veto of my veto was a good call . I think that went into a good -- a good place . </s>
So thank you to all of you for your participation and for the questions that you asked . So this concludes our fall season , but we 're starting up again right after New Year 's . </s>
We start a new season of five debates throughout -- from March -- from January through May . </s>
And we are setting them up now . And I just want to talk with you , let you know what 's coming up , what 's booked so far , what 's cast in iron at this point . </s>
On January 10th , the UN should recognize a Palestinian state , will be our motion . And our debaters will include , arguing for recognition , Hanan Shrowi who has long been a player in the story of the peace process . She was the first woman to be elected a member of the PLO 's executive committee , very frequent guest in the old days on `` Nightline . '' And we 're very , very happy that she 's coming in for that . And arguing on the other side , Aaron David Miller . </s>
He has served six secretaries of state on Arab-Israeli negotiations . </s>
And the rest of the slots on that debating panel are yet to be filled . On February 7th , our motion is going to be obesity is the government 's business . </s>
And we have booked Paul Campus . He is the author of `` The Obesity Myth . '' And he is trying to fight society 's fear of body fat . March 13th , the motion we go internationally . And every season we do -- we do something from the east , or try to . </s>
And this time a focus on China . In an interesting way we think China does capitalism better than America . </s>
And our debaters in that include Ian Bremmer who is a founder of a global political risk consultancy . New York Magazine says he makes -- his career makes Mozart look like an underachiever . </s>
And on April 17th , the motion will be `` When it comes to politics , the Internet is closing our minds . '' We 'll include David Weisberg who is a pioneer in online publishing , chairman of the Slate Group , and our partner in this whole process , and Ellie Freezer who is the former executive editor of moveon.org . And May 8th , we booked this before the news caught up with it . But the motion on May 8th is `` Ban college football . '' </s>
Our debaters will include Buzz Bissinger who is a writer and acclaimed author of Friday Night Lights . And Malcolm Gladwell who has compared football to dog fighting and who is the author of Blink . So our full line of debaters will be put together fairly soon . You can come to our Facebook page . </s>
And if you join our Facebook page , you 'll have a discount on future tickets . We 're also on Twitter and on NPR stations across the nation . </s>
You can check the local listings for when it 'll air on NPR and WNYC here in New York . </s>
And we 'll also be on public television , this particular debate as well . So again I want to thank you all . And we 're -- we 'll -- We 'll do a very -- a very brief countdown . </s>
I 'm going to guess from 60 seconds or so to the -- even faster . Thank you , Kris . All right . So we have the final results . We asked you to vote before the debate and once again after the debate on where you stood on this motion and on what team you felt argued their position best . </s>
And the team whose numbers changed the most are our winner . The motion is this : `` The world would be better off without religion . '' And here is the result . Before the debate , 52 percent were in support of the motion . 26 percent were against , and 22 percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , 59 percent support this motion . That 's up 7 percent . 31 percent are against it . That 's up only 5 percent . And 10 percent are undecided . </s>
That 's down 12 percent . That means the side arguing for the motion that `` The World Would Be Better Off Without Religion '' has carried this debate . Our congratulations to them . Thank you for me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S. We 'll see you next time . </s>
null </s>
Good evening . I 'd like to encourage people to come in and fill in the seats , even up in the front . Uh there 's not going to be a collection or an altar call so it 's OK . I am Peter Steinfels . </s>
And as moderator of this debate on whether America is too damn religious , I’ve been asked to offer the opening prayer . It 's very simple . We pray that all cell phones , pagers , Blackberrys , blueberries , strawberries , personal video games or anything else that beeps , squeaks or plays the William Tell overture or otherwise announced itself , be turned off for the duration of the evening . </s>
And if some people should fail to do this , may heaven open and turn them into pillars of salt , Amen . We look forward to an exciting , stimulating and enjoyable exchange of ideas . Tonight 's debate like its predecessors is being taped for radio broadcast . With each of these debates , this taping has grown more expert and refined . And there are now , I am told , microphones everywhere , hanging from the rafters , on the sides of the stage , probably in your lapels . </s>
And one result of this extraordinary taping is that certain sounds are magnified and distorted . I 'm also told that unwrapping candy or otherwise wrinkling cellophane sounds like fire breaking out in the auditorium . So if you anticipate an irrepressible need for a Snickers bar or a fresh packet of Kleenex to dab your eyes in response to our speakers ' eloquence , please unwrap it right now . A further word about response this evening . </s>
Naturally we will all give our outstanding debaters a respectful hearing . No jeers , cat calls , throwing cabbages and so on . But applause is very welcome . And the sound engineers can pick up all its gradations from tepid to exuberant . </s>
Especially if they have something of a sound check . And so if you do n't mind , I 'd like to ask you right now , could you give us a round of say polite applause ? Thank you very much , that was very polite . Perhaps bordering on the apathetic , but ... Now can we have an example of enthusiastic support . </s>
I know I 'd better not ask you for mindless frenzy . As the debaters make their opening statements this evening , you may be readying your own brief questions for the question and answer portion to follow . If you want three by five cards to write down your questions and that usually helps those of us who are shy and those of us who need some discipline , once we overcome that shyness , lest we be long winded , uh the ushers will provide you with such a card . And it is now my pleasure to introduce the chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , the sponsor of this evening 's event , please welcome Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Well thank you that was polite . I 'm here with Dana Wolfe , the executive producer of this debate series . And it 's my pleasure to welcome you . This is our first debate of our spring season , but you would n't know it was spring by being outside . </s>
We 're thrilled that WNYC is recording this series of debates and that through National Public Radio you 'll be able to hear this debate on public radio stations around the country . We also value the sponsorship of the Times of London . </s>
And I want to especially thank our moderator , Peter Steinfels , who I 'll formally introduce in a moment and the extraordinary group of panelists who are the real stars of tonight 's event . You know , I was looking at some opinion polls taken abroad in preparation for my remarks tonight and I find that sixty percent of respondents in France and Holland think that America is too religious . And people who think that also tend to be pretty anti-American . In Pakistan , sixty percent of people are anti-American and they consider that we 're not religious enough . They 're offended by the secular nature of our culture . </s>
Uh and um so , maybe we ca n't win or maybe we 've got it just right . </s>
What has been called our civil religion has a sacred history in America . Words from the Declaration of Independence—we hold these truths to be self evident . That we are endowed by our Creator with certain inalienable rights . </s>
The Gettysburg Address , four score and seven , invokes the cadences of the Bible . Our Thanksgiving , our major national holiday , thanks providence for America and invites us to meditate on our meaning . The Fourth of July celebrates liberty , Memorial Day – sacrifice . The moral imperatives of religion lead to an outpouring of support for victims of genocide in Rwanda . </s>
For victims of AIDS in Africa . </s>
For victims of national disasters anywhere on the planet . For a large and increasing number of Americans , Evangelical or Pentecostal churches give them what they need to live more responsible , more energetic , more meaningful lives . </s>
But as Mahatma Ghandi said , “those who say that religion has nothing to do with politics , do not know what religion is.” And our politics seem to have a great deal to do with religion these days . Controversies persist over gay marriage , stem cell research . The under God language of the Pledge of Allegiance . Vouchers for parochial school students . </s>
The fitness for a Mormon to run for President of the United States . Are these normal issues in the usual force of political discourse ? Or are they evidence that America is indeed too damn religious ? Well let 's see what our esteemed panelists have to say and which side of the motion will carry the day . Our moderator this evening is Peter Steinfels . </s>
Professor at Fordham University . Co-director of their Center on Religion and Culture , and a religion columnist for The New York Times . Peter created and continues to write his bi- weekly column , Beliefs , dealing with religion and ethics in the Times . He 's written numerous books on religion , including A People Adrift : The Crisis of the Roman Catholic Church in America . It 's now my pleasure to hand the evening over to Peter . </s>
Thank you very much Bob for your introduction . I would now also welcome you to the fifth Intelligence Squared US debate . And I 'd like to try and give you a brief rundown of the evening . First , the proponents of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument . </s>
The opposition will follow . </s>
Each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we will go back and forth from one side to the other . </s>
Second , when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks , I will open up the floor to some brief questions from the audience and perhaps toss in a few of my own . Third when the Q and A is complete , each debater will have the opportunity to make a final statement lasting not more than two minutes per person . </s>
Fourth , during the closing statements ballot boxes will be passed around for voting . This is the ticket . Whoops . This is the ballot box which has come suspiciously open in my picking it up . You will uh be asked to put in either the for piece , the against piece or the whole ticket if you still not – if you still have n't made up your mind as to which side you favor . </s>
If anyone does not have a ticket ballot , an usher will get you one at the appropriate time . </s>
Fifth and last , after the final closing statement is made , I will announce the results of the audience vote and tell you which side carried the day . </s>
Let me now introduce the panel which I 'm very proud to do . For the motion , author and program director of the think tank , the Center for Inquiry , Susan Jacoby . Executive Director of Americans United For Separation of Church and State , attorney and ordained minister , Barry W. Lynn . And author , professor of political science and director of the Boisi Center for Religion and American Public Life at Boston College , Alan Wolfe . Against the motion , the Laura Spelman Rockefeller Professor of Social and Political Ethics at the University of Chicago , political philosopher Jean Bethke Elshtain . </s>
Senior Fellow in the Brookings Institution 's Governance Studies Program and College Park Professor at the University of Maryland , William A. Galston . And the Henry W. Putnam Professor in religion at Princeton University , religious historian Albert J. Raboteau . </s>
And I think all of you know that there are even more extended biographies of our panelists this evening in the programs . So we will begin . </s>
Like to start out with a speaker for , to take the podium , for tonight 's motion . Uh Barry Lynn . Thank you very much . </s>
Uh so now that you know that I 'm both a minister and a lawyer , you know that I 'm capable of forgiving you but going on to sue you anyway . Um now what is it , why is it that a church going , Jesus-accepting member of the Christian clergy is on this side of the platform tonight ? And the answer really lies in the very carefully worded proposition that is under debate this evening . </s>
That America is too damn religious . I do n't think there is too much religion in America . Although my own colleagues actually might disagree with that . But I clearly think there 's too much of the damnable kind . </s>
What is a damned religion ? Damned religion is a religion so weak willed and unsure of its own capacity to persuade others to support it or live by its guidance that it seeks the blessing of government . </s>
That it seeks financial aid from government . And that it even tries to convert its theological beliefs into legislative fiats . This damned form of religion is a corruption both of faith and of constitutional democracy . </s>
And it makes a mockery of the best in our history . </s>
It was the fifth United States Congress that unanimously approved the Treaty of Tripoli which unequivocally stated that this was in no way founded as a Christian nation . Thomas Jefferson refused to sign proclamations of prayer or resolutions of thanksgiving , believing how shocking is this , that it should be religious bodies , not governmental ones that decided what days should bring forth the greatest prayer from the American people . And James Madison even objected to the 1790 census form because it had a question merely asking you if you were a member of the clergy . Indeed , throughout most of our American history we 've been moving toward a greater embrace of religious diversity . </s>
A greater rejection of the idea that government , federal or state should pick favorites among religions or choose religion over non-religion . By 1960 then presidential aspirant John F. Kennedy addressed a meeting of Southern Baptists concerned about his allegiances as a Roman Catholic , to declare , “I believe in an America where the separation of church and state is absolute.” But what a difference a few decades can make . Now politicians see as much advantage in pandering to religion as the embarrassingly religion seems to gain or try to gain by seeking the assistance of government . So it 's a dual corruption , tainting the secular nature of our government and making religious groups special interest supplicants at what is often a quite odoriferous public trough . </s>
So let me just briefly go into these uh specifics in these minutes remaining , of how this unholy matrimony kind of plays out in the 21st century . First , religious groups too often , if you will , seek the blessing of government . A few examples . </s>
As if the nation were somehow absent private property , now we see public spaces increasingly festooned with more and more religious icons and images , monuments and scriptural citations . Almost always at the behest of the currently statistically most popular religion in America , Christianity . Now I concede that a lot of Americans like it that way . In a December poll for example , seventy eight percent of the respondents said they wanted to continue to see nativity scenes outside their local government offices . But curiously in the same poll only fifty three percent said they were actually planning to attend a worship service at Christmas . </s>
Is it really good for religion when its adherents in larger numbers would like to catch a quick glimpse of Jesus in a manger , possibly surrounded by a few reindeer and candy canes , rather than actually spend an hour sitting for a religious ceremony . It ca n't be . Or how about the reasoning used in a constitutional challenge to Ohio 's official motto – “With God all things are possible.” The federal appeals court upheld the continued use of the seal , claiming that the phrase had essentially lost its religious significance . There was widespread applause from the religious right . </s>
But again to me how can you be happy as a spiritual person when a court notes that the statement that God is both alive and omnipotent is seen as theologically meaningless form overuse . </s>
I should note sometimes occasionally legislators also go beyond this . </s>
They confuse religion with magic . </s>
After every major uh school shooting in the United States , members of Congress insist that if we posted the Ten Commandments on every school room wall we would stop the next violent student uprising from occurring . They 're never willing to talk about gun control . </s>
They 're never willing to even talk about spending money to work with at risk young people but the decalogue display is the panacea . But you know if proximity to holy words really made us better people then the presence of Gideon Bibles in nightstands at motels would have ended adultery long ago and its has not . It is not that simple . Now second , dissatisfied with some powerful symbolic support , some groups even go further and actually want to receive from the public treasury the tax dollars of all of this . Funding . </s>
President Bush likes this idea . He created an office of faith based initiatives back in 2001 to get more money for what he called the armies of compassion around America who cared for the poor , the hungry and the homeless . </s>
What he forgot to tell us is that government had been partnering with many religious organizations for many decades in this county with just two little caveats . First , any program that got federal money had to forget evangelizing in that program . So that if money went to counseling people suffering from addiction , you had to stick to medical and psychological counseling with those federal dollars and leave the idea of getting right with God to some other separately funded program . Second , it was presumed that you only got tax dollars to provide secular services and that you had to therefore hire the most qualified person for the job regardless of any preference you might wish to give on the basis of religious belief or affiliation . But for the President those caveats were just technicalities . </s>
He told an audience in New Orleans just one year before he forgot that the city existed that he saw his program as one that would give funds to groups that are saving Americans one soul at a time . Once again confusing his role as Commander in Chief of that of theologian in chief . He claimed that hiring by faith groups could be done without regard to civil rights laws against discrimination and I find that such an absurd commentary for the early twenty first century . </s>
Does anyone think that Baptists or Buddhists or Atheists or Adventists actually ladle the food in a soup kitchen differently ? </s>
Does it make any difference to you as a person living in a homeless shelter One minute warning . Whether that – uh Adventist has tucked in your bed sheet or an Atheist has done it . Final characteristic of damned religion is the most pernicious . That 's where religious groups decide that because they are sure that they have a Biblical understanding of an issue , say the right of reproductive choice , no one will be dared to have another opinion and act on it . </s>
That 's why they seek things like constitutional amendments to prohibit all abortion . </s>
I know that there are people on the other side of this debate who will say that there is great evidence of progressive thinking in churches now and in the past and obviously that 's true . But I remind you that Dr. Martin Luther King never created a hundred million dollar dialing for dollars ministry on television . </s>
He never endorsed a single candidate from any pulpit in America . He knew that the long arc of justice would reach its goal only when all Americans , black and white , young and old , believer and non-believer , would count on the Constitution as the last great protector of the rights of the people . That 's the faith that ought to guide religion in America but regrettably it 's the damned kind that seems to get all the attention and have all the clout today . </s>
And luckily because I am not running for any elective If you 'll wrap it up ... office , I do not have to say at the end of this small speech , God Bless America . Thank you very much Barry Lynn . </s>
And now the first speaker against the motion , Jean Bethke Elshtain . </s>
America is too damn religious . Says who ? We could ask our greatest presidential theologian Abraham Lincoln , who references God fourteen times in the four paragraphs of his masterpiece of American political rhetoric , the second inaugural address . </s>
We could ask Martin Luther King with the rhythms of cadences and words of Scripture flowing eloquently in his powerful civic sermons . As you listen to that remarkable voice , intoning the words of the prophet Amos , let justice roll down like a mighty river . Close your eyes and utter Amen brother , Amen . King certainly worked to bring theological beliefs into political imperatives . </s>
Indeed we could ask the African American community and my distinguished colleague , Professor Roboteau will say more , are you too damn religious ? For that community has a long history of bringing religion into civic life . Or , you could consult Dorothy Day of this city . </s>
It was awfully damned religious of her to organize tax revolts and protest marches against all manner of injustice as she understood the public implications of her faith . Or Monsignor John Ryan , Father New Deal as he was called . </s>
And adviser to FDR who brought Catholic social teaching to questions of economic justice . And how about that FDR ? Goes on the radio and offers a prayer on D Day , broadcast to all of America , to the world and to our soldiers on both fronts . Presumably we are not to have any more of that thing , kind of thing . We could ask pro life citizens today , many of whom are called by their faith to oppose abortion and to challenge what they take to be the abuse of state authority to sanction through law , a harrowing practice . I 'm assuming most in this room do n't agree with their position , but in their protest , I would remind you that they remind us of what free speech and free exercise of religion is all about . </s>
Do we really want to put ourselves in the position of authorizing busybodies to say to our preachers and politicians and citizens at every turn you 've crossed the line ? You 're now too damned religious . </s>
You 're bringing your faith in everywhere and now keeping it safely contained . </s>
Tusk tusk . Now we will be likely to hear certain things from our opponents . </s>
We may be treated to a rogue 's gallery , a line up of religious suspects . Guilty as charged . </s>
Fanatics out to steal our liberties and endanger the republic thereby . </s>
As I read these sorts of accounts I 'm stunned that America has survived . </s>
We will be told that it is only the hyper vigilance of those determined to snuff out too damn much religion that has spared us . But the view that we are too damned religious does not pass critical muster . </s>
I 'm a professor and tempted to be professorial by citing distinguished scholars on church and state , who point out that it is the vigilance of religious citizens to over-extension of state power determined to quash the too damned religious that has over the years , protected the freedoms of us all . </s>
Free exercise . Freedom of speech . Freedom of assembly . </s>
They have n't done this alone of course but please , I beg you , at this late date do n't engage in the shallow exercise of pitting the non-religious who support civil liberties against those with religious commitments who allegedly do not . It flies in the face of the facts . And while we 're at it , let 's not traffic in the tedious pitting of faith against reason that we hear so frequently . In the long history of Christianity as you heard from from Reverend Lynn , America 's dominant faith tradition , the great theologians for centuries explored the entanglement of faith and reason . In my class yesterday at the University of Chicago we discussed Thomas Aquinas with his relentless emphasis on human reason and his definition of human beings as rational , mortal creatures . </s>
Of course you will find some who downgraded reason in the overall scheme of things . </s>
But you would be hard pressed to find a great theologian who understood faith as nothing but a leap into irrationality . </s>
Rather , the challenge was to ask how faith and reason worked together . How we could bring faith and reason to issues of our time . </s>
Rather than to assume that they were polar opposites . As to criminal activity , whether committed by the religious or non- religious , ladies and gentlemen we have remedies in law . </s>
We are not helpless when confronted by fanatics who commit crimes from whichever direction they come . </s>
The problem is that to our opponents , the fanatics tend to come from one direction only . Are we to compare terrible persons and happenings ? I dare say that in the twentieth century the anti-religious who thought all religion was damned religion would win hands down . </s>
Who can forget that electric moment at the trial of the Nazi war criminal , Adolph Eichmann , when he refused to take an oath on the Bible . He was part of the Nazi inner circle . </s>
He would not touch his hand to this book . The story of those despised Israelites and the Christians who effeminized people as the Nazis put it all the time , by trying to keep the strong from destroying the weak which is precisely what they were all about . Now in the history of our republic , confessional pluralism and social and political pluralism go hand in hand . If you think we 're too damn religious , you 're likely to think we 're too damn pluralistic . </s>
One of the glories of this country has turned into a liability and a danger thereby . The great French observer of the American democracy , Alexis DeTocqueville , noticed something new under the political sun when he toured these United States . He took account of the way that religious conviction and associational energy and enthusiasm went hand in hand , helping to create a unique , robust , civil society . True then , 1830 – true now </s>
One - As my distinguished colleague , Professor Galston will point out . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , this is New York City . I know you are a tough crowd . I would ask you to listen to the voice of reason from our side . That understands that one should not , from any direction , separate America 's citizens who accept a secular world from those , the religious , who allegedly do not . Citizens of religious commitment are among the most enthusiastic supporters of a secular government . </s>
They do n't want established religion but they also understand that to support a secular government and state does not commit us to a thoroughly secularized society , shorn of religious voices , symbols , activities and commitments . </s>
We would be a greatly impoverished country were this to come to pass . So too damn religious ? Nope . Just pretty damn American . Thank you very much Jean Elshtain . </s>
And now speaking for tonight 's motion , Alan Wolfe . This does n't . If the proposition before us tonight was the proposition are Americans too damned religious , I would answer no . In fact I 'd be on that side of the table . Um Americans it seems to me , could very well be much more religious than they actually are . </s>
If Americans were more religious , I believe , we would have much more social justice in this country . </s>
We would have much more of an active welfare state in this country . </s>
One of the reasons why European societies have their welfare states , with such extensive social provisions for children and for the elderly and for the helpless , is because they 've had Christian Democratic parties that have relied on Christian social teachings to create a society much more caring than our own . If Americans were much more religious there would have been much more pretest against the revelations of torture at Abu Ghraib and other aspects of our foreign policy . For someone to be tortured and hung up like he was being crucifixed would be so unacceptable if Americans were more religious that there would have been massive protests . </s>
Not only against the tactics , the illegal torture tactics used by the Bush administration but by the whole war in Iraq would have , which would have violated the social teachings of the single most , largest Christian denomination in the United States , the Catholic church . If Americans were more religious they would listen more to the Pope and his opposition to the war . If Americans were more religious however , if Americans were more religious , America would be much less religious . Our proposition is whether America is too religious and on that question I 'm on this side of the fence . </s>
Because there 's a difference between Americans as individuals and America as a public space and a public society . </s>
Now I want to offer I want to offer this proposition as the basis of my remarks . If Americans were more damned religious as opposed to America , the single greatest benefit would be that George W. Bush would never have been elected President of the United States . Why do I say that ? Because I believe that the face of the Republican Party , sometimes called the Christian right is much more a political movement than it is a religious movement . </s>
And that it has violated the spirit of what it means to be religious in American life and in particular it’s violated the spirit of its own religious tradition . I 'm fascinated by one historical figure who I believe to be the single most important American never to have had a full length biography written of him . His name was John Leland . He was a Baptist minister and itinerant preacher in the early 19th century . Uh he wrote in his memoirs , he said I’ve preached in four hundred and thirty six meeting houses , thirty seven courthouses , several capitals , many academies and school house . </s>
Barns , tobacco houses , dwelling houses and so on . </s>
He estimated that he converted sixteen hundred people to Jesus Christ and he praised Jesus Christ as his savior . We owe to John Leland , the First Amendment to the United States Constitution . It was John Leland who engaged in a bargain with James Madison in Virginia that Leland would support Madison as a delegate to the convention that ratified the US Constitution if Madison would drop his previous opposition to a Bill of Rights and support one . </s>
James Leland uh John Leland was a Baptist . The Baptists in America under the guise and leadership of people like Roger Williams had been uh uh very , very passionate and devoted advocates of religious liberty in the United States . </s>
All that changed in the 1980s . It changed in the 1980s when John Leland 's heirs , the Southern Baptist Convention , dropped its long history of commitment to religious liberty to move in a more theocratic direction for explicitly political reasons . I 'm sure that almost no one in this room knows that in 1973 when the United States Supreme Court handed down its decision in Roe v Wade , the decision that presumably started the American culture war , the Southern Baptist Convention was fully in support of Roe v Wade . </s>
Baptists distrusted the state . They distrusted state intervention . If a state could tell a woman what she could do with her body , it could tell a believer what he or she could do with his or her mind . By 1980s the Southern Baptist Convention had completely changed its position . </s>
Repudiated its earlier support and become the major force besides the Catholic Church in America , to overturn Roe v Wade . Now I submit that between 1973 and 1983 , God did not change his mind on the question of abortion . </s>
But Baptists did . Why did they change their mind ? </s>
They changed their minds in part because they believed that America had become too decadent a society . </s>
But they also changed their minds because they saw an opportunity . The Reagan presidency . The opportunity to exercise political power in America . </s>
And they opted for political power and it was the direct result of this change in the Southern Baptist Convention . </s>
Our largest Protestant denomination that created the southern Republican Party and that eventually resulted in the election of George W. Bush with the enthusiastic support of people associated with the Southern Baptist Convention . In a democratic society , all the more power to them . They do n't like Roe v Wade , all the more power to them . Organize politically . Elect your candidates , change the law . </s>
Get new people on the Supreme Court . I am second to none in my admiration for their political success . I do n't agree with them , I 'm on the other side . </s>
But you , I can not take away the brilliance of their political tactics or the brilliance of the Bush administration in using and relying on that base . But to think that this has anything whatsoever to do with matters of the spirit , matters of the heart or matters of one 's relationship to a supreme being strikes me as far too great a stretch . I do not know George W Bush . I do know Bill and Hillary Clinton . I have no idea whether George W Bush in his own heart is a religious man . </s>
But in his public persona , he is the least religious President I could ever imagine . A man without a shred of doubt about the wisdom of his policies . A man without a shred of humility and modesty as he faces the difficult challenges brought on , I must say , by his own incompetence . A man filled with public piety but without a conscience . If one could ever imagine , ever imagine George W Bush sitting around with his advisors and thinking about what he 's gon na do and Karl Rove comes in and says I know what you got ta do you got ta do this , could you ever imagine George W Bush saying – Karl that 's a great idea but I 'm sorry , I 'm a Christian . </s>
One - The most important word in Christian theology is the word no . There are things that I can not do because my conscience will not allow it . It 's inconceivable to me that that could ever happen . </s>
Precisely because the Republican Party has been so successfully political , politically it is incumbent upon people who oppose them to expose their use of religion for political purposes . </s>
To protect religion in America against those , the single greatest abusers of religion in America uh the Republican Party , the Christian conservatives and other people who are degrading everything meaningful , serious and spiritual in the tradition that they claim to represent . Thank you . Thank you very much Alan Wolfe . The next speaker , speaking against the motion will be Albert Raboteau . </s>
Good evening . Week after next , Christians , the largest religious group in the nation will begin the season of Lent . A period of prayer and fasting in preparation for Easter . The holiest feast of the Christian year . </s>
In that context I recall the voice of Isiah speaking in the name of the Lord . Is not this the fast that I choose to loose the bonds of injustice ? To undo the thongs of the yolk . To let the oppressed go free and to break every yolk . Is it not to share your bread with the hungry and bring the homeless poor into your house ? </s>
When you see the naked , to cover them . And not to hide your self from your own flesh and blood . </s>
In a land of super-abundance and obscene excess , a land of economic inequality and serious levels of intransigent poverty and homelessness , can we hear the voice of Isiah and really claim that we in our nation are too religious ? When we tally up our church attending statistics , and the large number of Americans who believe in God , do we remember the words of Amos , again speaking in the name of the Lord . I hate , I despise your festivals and I take no delight in your solemn assemblies . But let justice roll down like the waters and righteousness like a mighty stream . </s>
By Amos ' standard of justice enacted equitably for rich and poor alike , can we really claim that we are too religious ? Mired down in a preemptive war that has cost thousands upon thousands of lives with no end in sight . </s>
Can we listen to the prophecy of Micah , they shall beat their swords into plough shares and their spears into pruning hooks . A nation shall not lift up sword against nation . Neither shall they study war anymore . Can we listen to these words without a pang of remorse that our efforts to build peace and have been so feeble and so ineffectual . </s>
Do we observe the commandments delivered in the sermon on the mount . Do not resist evil-doers . If anyone strikes you on the right cheek , turn the other also . Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you . No one can serve two masters , you can not serve God and Mammon . </s>
Do not worry about your life , what you will eat or what you will drink or what you will wear . </s>
Do not judge , lest you be judged . </s>
Do unto others as you would have them do unto you . Be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect . </s>
Do we obey the singular new commandment proclaimed in John 's gospel ? Love one another as I have loved you . By this shall all know that you are my disciples by how you love another . </s>
A love in action , not just words . Feed the hungry . Give drink to the thirsty . </s>
Welcome the stranger . Clothe the naked . </s>
Tend to the sick . Visit those in prison . For when you do these things to the least among you , you do them to Christ . </s>
The prophetic strain in the Hebrew and Christian Scriptures has down through the ages constantly challenged religious communities to focus on the one thing necessary . What the prophets articulate in word and gesture and in the case of Christ literally in body according to Christian belief , is the divine pathos , to use Abraham Joshua Heschel 's wonderful term . </s>
God 's compassionate concern for the plight of human kind . Especially for the weak , the outcast , the widow , the sojourner . The prophet experiences the divine pathos as a fire in the bones , compelling him or her to speak and act . </s>
In twentieth century America an amazing network of religious activists carried on this prophetic tradition . </s>
Dorothy Day , co- founder of the Catholic Worker Movement , established houses of hospitality to feed , clothe and shelter the indigent . </s>
Based on the belief in our personal responsibility to live in solidarity with the poor . AJ Musty , non-violent agitator and labor organizer , longtime director of the Fellowship of Reconciliation taught that suffering in the cause of justice releases God 's presence into the stream of human history . Abraham Joshua Heschel applied the concept of divine pathos to the modern struggle for social justice . As he marched with King from Selma to Montgomery and organized active protests against the Vietnam War . Howard Thurman , preacher , ecumenist and mystic , co-pastored the first interracial and inter-faith congregation in the nation . </s>
And spent a lifetime teaching that the search for community is part of the very structure of our being . Thomas Merton , Catholic contemplative monk wrote compellingly about the necessity of solitude , silence and simplicity for discovering our true selves , beyond the false persona fed by the consumerism of our mass society . Martin Luther King Junior deeply rooted in the black religious tradition of suffering Christianity arising out of slavery , confronted racial and economic inequality and argued that we have to transform America from a thing oriented to a person oriented society , lest we succumb to the giant triplets of racism , materialism and militarism that continue to afflict us . </s>
If we heed the voices of these modern prophets and their ancient predecessors , we wo n't conclude that Americans or America are too religious . If we take heed we will see how often we preach religion while practicing consumerist , conspicuous consumption . How often we turn piety into another form of ego gratification . Useful for comforting the comfortable and empowering the powerful . </s>
We will see how easy and seductive it has always been to blunt the prophetic drive of religion to radically change our lives and our society . We will see that we are not nearly religious enough . </s>
Thank you very much Albert Raboteau . And now speaking for the motion , Susan Jacoby . I am not an ordained minister or a rabbi . So it seems I am here to speak to you tonight in the role of the atheist in the room . Since these are Oxford rules I 'm just going to pretend this is the Oxford Union and say that America is too bloody religious . </s>
Now the case for God 's country is being made in great Biblical language and the scholarly language of Princeton , the University of Chicago and soon to come that might fortress of religion , the Brookings Institution . Uh but ladies and gentlemen let us step down from the ivory tower and the church steeple into what one of President Bush 's advisors famously called the reality based world . </s>
Down here in the reality based world , we must first talk about the retrograde form of religion that holds one third of Americans in thrall . This is the proportion of Americans who say that they believe every word in the Bible is literally true . Not merely inspired by God but the literal handwriting of God . </s>
One out of three . </s>
What an astounding statistic . Reflecting a level of credulity that exists nowhere else in the developed world . The widespread persistence of such an anti-diluvian form of faith is a true affliction in American society and demonstrates alas , that the liberty of conscience guaranteed by our Constitution also leaves us the liberty to bind ourselves with the chains of unreason . Our opponents would have you believe that those of us who consider America too bloody religious are concerned mainly with legalistic issues involving the separation of church and state . </s>
In fact our nation 's excessive religiosity affects individual lives and public policy in ways that are often matters of life and death . I could offer two hours worth of examples or eight hours but mindful of the clock , here are just two . First , consider that the United States is the only country in the Western world with the death penalty . Every study of this issue has shown that pro death penalty views correlate closely with biblically based religious beliefs . Justice Antonin Scalia , a Roman Catholic so far to the right that he is at odds with his own church on the issue , more Catholic than the Pope you might say – believes that since all legitimate governmental power is derived from God and God has the power of life and death , so too must governments . </s>
In a 2002 speech Scalia quoted Paul 's famous epistle to the Romans about government heads being duly designated ministers of God to avenge evil . </s>
Then Scalia noted nostalgically and I quote – “few doubted the morality of the death penalty in an age that believed in the divine right of kings.” Well yes those were surely the good old days . And does n't it say something about our excessive respect for religion in America that this is considered a perfectly respectable position . Scalia , after all , is a Supreme Court justice but I can assure you can find his sentiments in less elevated English on every crack pot right wing web site . Let us consider another very different example . </s>
The United States has the highest rate of teen pregnancy and one of the highest rates of sexually transmitted diseases among teenagers again in the developed world , why ? Not because American teenagers are more sexually active than any other but because conservative religious believers have blocked sensible sex education programs and have made it as difficult as possible for teenagers to obtain contraceptives . Just recently , we learned that the man in charge of the only federal birth control program for the poor , one Dr . Eric Keroack spends much of his time appearing at religiously sponsored abstinence conferences , where he promotes the notion that premarital sex ruins your chances for lasting marriage because too much sex makes you lose too much oxytocin . The hormone of pleasurable intimacy released with every orgasm . </s>
Too many orgasms and there go your precious bodily fluids for the rest of your life . It seems that Dr. Keroack is a disciple not of the Lord , but of General Jack D. Ripper from the movie Doctor Strangelove . Uh this would be funny if our tax dollars were not paying this lunatic to peddle his nutty combination of right wing faith and junk science . </s>
Now – . What of the majority of Americans who are the kind of religious believers who have made room for secular knowledge in their house of faith . Martin Luther King has been very much on my mind recently too . </s>
Because it’s been forty years since he made his courageous speech denouncing the Vietnam War at the Riverside Church . Some of you were probably there . </s>
The most important points to be made here are that Dr. King , both on civil rights and the war , was speaking truth to power from outside the government . </s>
And he was speaking to a morality that transcended every religion and was in direct opposition to the religious beliefs of many Americans at the time . It is utterly nauseating to hear representatives of the religious right today , cloak themselves in Dr. King 's mantle when their spiritual ancestors were standing in the school house door and waving Bibles in support of segregation . So if you 're going to talk about religion and all the good it can do in society , you also have to talk about religion and all the bad it can do and not pretend that bad religion is somewhere out there and has nothing to do at all with good religion . Our opponents suggest that reasonable religion does have nothing to do with extremist religion . </s>
But there are a great many more people of unreasonable faith in this country than sophisticated experts on theology would like to believe . And would like you to believe . </s>
Barry Lynn has mentioned attempts to inject intelligent design in our schools . </s>
But that 's just the tip of the iceberg . </s>
On October 30th , 2005 , the Pew Forum on Religion in Public Life released the results of an opinion poll that was ignored in the press because Hurricane Katrina had slammed into the Gulf Coast the day before . Among the findings , two thirds of Americans want both evolution and creationism to be taught in public schools . Fewer than half of Americans accept any form of evolution , including evolution guided by God by the way . Finally , an astonishing forty two percent say that all living beings have existed in their present form since the beginning of time . These religiously based beliefs are an intellectual disaster for our country . </s>
Americans of all faiths have confused the freedom of religion in our Constitution , which allows people to believe whatever they want , with the respect for the beliefs themselves . Last fall in a lecture at a church affiliated college in the South , I said that I do not respect the belief that the universe was created in seven days . Even though of course I respect any one 's right to believe that . A very polite young woman came up to me afterward and said that she was an evangelical Christian and was personally insulted by my saying that I did n't respect her beliefs about Creation . I asked her if she genuinely respected </s>
One - -- my atheism and she admitted that she did n't . </s>
But she said she did feel sorry for me . She also told me she wanted to be a high school teacher because she , but she was n't going to become one because she was sure she would prevented from bearing witness to her faith . I suggested that she wait and indulge in some free inquiry before she made such a decision at age eighteen . I ca n't do that she said . </s>
With the accent on ca n't . There 's no better idea than the truth . </s>
This was a young mind in faith based chains in the 21st century in a nation whose Constitution was written by men of the Enlightenment . It is this young woman and millions of young women and men like her who represented the tragedy of Americans overly deferential toward religion . What we need in this country is not more faith of any kind but a new age of reason . </s>
Thank you . Thank you very much Susan Jacoby . And now the final speaker against the , tonight 's motion will be William Galston . The topic before us is one that stirs understandable passions . And as if the topic were n't enough uh our worthy opponents are doing their best to pour gas on the flames . </s>
But I 'd like to proceed somewhat differently . Uh I 'd like to appeal if I may to your reason . To your fair mindedness and to your sense of our shared national history not the myopia of the moment . Let me tell you what this debate is not about . </s>
It 's not about whether you have to be religious to be a good American . Of course you do n't . Nor it is about whether you approve of the way that the most intense elements of the Republican coalition speaking in the name of religion , have conducted themselves . </s>
As a lifelong activist Democrat I sure do n't . </s>
Neither do most Americans and obviously neither do you . Nor finally is it about whether religion in America is without excess or without sin . </s>
Of course it is n't for the simple reason it is a human institution . </s>
Here I believe is the real question . If you believe America is too religious , you must believe that we 'd be a better country if we were less religious or maybe not religious at all . That 's the proposition I 'd like to contest . </s>
Now , admittedly this is n't an easy argument or inquiry to conduct . It 's rather like asking whether Bedford Falls would have been better or a better place without George Bailey . Well quite obviously I 'm no angel and I 'm certainly not Frank Capra but I 'm gon na do my best to persuade you . Invoking your reason , your fair mindedness and your sense of history , that America is better off with the religion it has with all its flaws than without it . I want to make three simple point , points . </s>
First of all , from the very beginning of our history , religious Americans have been at the forefront of most if not all of the turning points in our history . Consider the Revolutionary War , where for ten years prior to our Declaration of Independence , Protestant ministers from the pulpit , were teaching the lessons of liberty . And so when Thomas Jefferson came to draft the Declaration of Independence , he did n't have to make up a new theory . He only had to do what he said he did years later in a letter to a friend , to state the plain common sense of the American mind . </s>
Or consider the anti-slavery movement . First in England and then in the United States , religious Americans were in the lead . After the Civil War with the rise of industrial capitalist , the teachers of the social gospel spearheaded progressive reform . </s>
They were at the forefront of concern for immigrants and for the poor . As Professor Elshtain has already pointed out . In the 1920s the Catholic church engaged with organized labor and its leading intellectuals and theologians set the stage for the New Deal . </s>
In the 1950s and 1960s , the civil rights movement of course . Uh but the anti-war movement , the anti-Vietnam war movement was fueled and sustained among other things by religious passions . Today , movements to fight AIDS , famine and genocide are led by Americans of faith . Last year I had the privilege of attending a rally on the Washington Mall against our government 's inaction in Darfur . And I can tell you if you took the religious people out of that crowd , there would hardly have been anyone left . </s>
Here’s my second point . Religious Americans are among our most engaged citizens today and their engagement strengthens our community . I 'm not gon na deluge you with statistics . But I can tell you this – religious Americans are far more likely than non-religious Americans to give to charitable causes and that includes non-religious causes . Religious Americans are far more likely to volunteer than are non-religious Americans and that includes for non-religious causes . </s>
Religious Americans are far more likely to participate in our nation 's politics . </s>
To follow it closely . To attend political meetings . To join local reform groups . </s>
To contact elected officials and even to vote than are non-religious Americans . And all of these generalizations hold true after one corrects for income , marital status and all the other variables that social scientists like to play with . Here 's my third point – religious Americans , unlike what you have heard from our worthy opponents are not , repeat not a threat to our liberties . An overwhelming majority of religious Americans practice what one eminent scholar has termed a private faith . </s>
It is private rather than public . </s>
Tolerant and inclusive , moderate than extreme and above all , non-judgmental . </s>
These are not simple social science abstractions . If you do n't believe me , look at the Terry Schiavo affair . Strident voices in the Republican base said go for it . </s>
The Republican Congressional leaders went for it . President Bush even flew back from Crawford , interrupting for one of the few times in his Presidency a vacation . And then what happened ? These folks were stunned to find that they had a genuine public revolt on their hands . Including a revolt of a majority of religious Americans who considered what the government was doing meddling and intrusive , a violation of family privacy and abuse of law to limit our personal freedoms . </s>
And so my friends , to sum up , religious Americans have been at the forefront of progressive change throughout our history . They strengthen our society and our politics today and they do not strengthen – they do not threaten , indeed they reinforce our tradition of liberty . </s>
One - Now , if you 've followed me on this journey I 'll hope , I hope you 'll agree that just as George Bailey in normal , ennobled Bedford Falls – so religious Americans with all their flaws have ennobled our country . </s>
But my guess is that many of you remain unconvinced . What about the shrill voices , the calls for a Christian America ? Jerry Falwell 's lunatic rantings ? </s>
Well of this and more is true . But every movement , secular and religious has its extremists . Those with tunnel vision and an absolute conviction of their own rectitude who will brook no compromise . Let me ask you – who among you would wish to be judged in accordance with the most extreme version of the faith or beliefs you profess ? </s>
To judge fairly you must look at the full picture , not the fringe . And if you do , I 'm confident that you will conclude that America is not too damm religious after all . Thank you very much William Galston . We 've now completed the first portion of the evening 's debate . And at this point I 'd like to announce the results of the pre-debate vote . </s>
Before the debate sixty seven point forty six percent of you – I like that uh second decimal uh refinement there – sixty seven point forty six percent of you voted for the motion . Uh twenty four point four oh percent of you voted against the motion . And eight point one four percent of you were in the category of do n't know . </s>
We 're now ready to begin the question and answer portion of this evening 's debate . I will call on the questioners . Someone on each side of the auditorium will come to you with a microphone . Please stand when you ask your question . I would ask that first you do not start to ask your question until you have the microphone . </s>
Secondly and obviously importantly uh please make your questions short and to the point . If any questions come from members of the press , they should identify themselves as such . And finally members of the audience have the option to identify themselves or such – or not if they , depending on which they choose to do . So if we could have a first question . Thank you – am I – the one – I 'm sorry they gave me the mic so I thought I was </s>
I ca n't see – over here yes . Thank you . Thank you all the panelists for your excellent talks . My name is Jerry Orstrom . </s>
I 'd like to ask the panelists opposed the motion uh their views on the teaching of intelligent design in the schools as an alternative to evolution . Uh would any of the panelists volunteer to do that or shall I toss the question at one or the other of you or toss it over to the other folks to answer for the panelists who are against . Well I speak as the son of the Sterling Professor of Biology Emeritus at Yale University . </s>
Uh so I think you can probably guess what I believe about the matter at hand . Uh having said that uh John Stewart Mills said something that stuck with me ever , ever since the first time I read it as an undergraduate . </s>
He who knows only his own side of the case does n't even know that . Uh and I am I am fascin – I was fascinated to read a review of a biography of , of the uh you know the English botanist , Alfred Russel Wallace . You know who was a contemporary of Darwin and some believe anticipated him and how Wallace struggled with the question of the relationship between evolution and design . </s>
You know what , I think our students might be better off if they knew something about that controversy . I 'm not saying I 'm in favor of the kinds of curricula that the extremists are pushing but if you 're asking me in principle , would it be good for our students to know that there is a history of debate on these issue , this issue , and people who are by no means manifestly foolish have taken various points of view . </s>
No I do n't think they would be worse off . Uh Barry Lynn did you want to respond to that . Um Bill I think this is a good example of what we 're talking about tonight . The truth is that in two major recent studies , high school biology teachers said that they spent quote little or no time discussing evolution . Why do they do that ? </s>
Because they are afraid of stirring up community distaste for what they 're doing in those public schools . So in a world , in some other alternate universe where we would have the time to spend enormous amounts of time talking about evolution and then perhaps discussing this controversy , you might be making a very important point . </s>
But we are now facing a dumbing down of science so terrible in this country that biology teachers , without any statutes or passage of any goofy resolutions from school boards , are simply afraid to teach the truth . </s>
The scientific truth as they know it to be true . They do n't doubt it but they 're afraid to teach it . And that 's the climate of religious intolerance . Of religious efforts to move city councils , state legislatures , state boards of educations in the direction of Biblical literalism instead of scientific truth . Without even understanding that there 's a difference between the two disciplines . </s>
That 's the real world that Susan was talking about . That 's what we find when we litigate these cases as we did with the ACLU of Pennsylvania up in Dover , Pennsylvania . </s>
I have to say I 'm a little tired of this real world , illusory world distinction . </s>
Um as those of us over here somehow living in um I think you said an alternative universe where in fact certain kinds of discussions can go forward . And and be had and it 's to the benefit of everyone . That 's simply not the case . I think that we understand very well the kinds of pressures that can be brought to bear given the way America has organized its schools we 've never had total monolithic control of the schools . We have school districts with a lot of independence . </s>
That means you 're going to get variety from place to place . If this process of dumbing down were as systematic as Mr. Lynn suggests it makes our continuing astonishing uh sort of scientific progress and the fact that people come from all over the world to study science here , a bit perplexing . </s>
Uh now having said that let me just indicate that if you look at the kinds of text books that are used , which I did but maybe I was doing that in an alternate universe that are used to teach science in our high schools and are the most widely adopted text books , you see that evolution in fact is covered and that it is something that is addressed . But it is also important not to become , it seems to me , if we 're worried about fundamentalism uh there is a kind of Darwinian fundamentalism that in fact will brook no debate and no opposition . And the truth of the matter is , if you know anything about this field at all is that there 's a tremendous amount of debate internal to it . </s>
And a lot of , and scientists who are uh see themselves as evolutionists who strenuously reject Darwin 's classical theory and so forth . </s>
So I think students can handle these kinds of debates , both within science and between the scientists and those with an alternate account . Although I should say that a lot of the intelligent design people including a very distinguished scientist named Sir John Polkinghorne do support some notion of intelligent design . So it 's not just a bunch of whackos out there who want to dumb everything down , who think this debate should go forward . Well we 'll have Al and then Susan . </s>
OK this is tangential as I think most of my comments are tonight to some of the debate but if we 're talking about the real world I think what really concerns me is not whether the , this debate about intelligent design and Darwinism , that has some importance , what concerns me is the corporate presence in our schools in which students are eating pizza from Pizza Hut and Coca Cola from the Coca Cola company . </s>
The rampant disease of consumerism . That is showing its way in terms of unprecedented numbers of child obesity in our society . In the real world what bothers me is that the average American child , whatever they study in terms of issues of Darwinism or intelligent design watches three and a half hours of television a night . </s>
The average American adult watches five hours of television a day . </s>
Talk about dumbing down - that 's where it comes from . That 's twenty one thousand commercials a year . I 'm gon na have to ask our , our debaters to be a little bit briefer in their responses so we can get to some more questions . </s>
But first of all Susan . </s>
Yes I would just like to say that Dr. Elshtain 's comment is typical of this kind of argument . </s>
She is suggesting that there is actually debate about evolution versus intelligent design . There is of course much debate within the scientific community about many of the particulars of evolution . There is no debate at all in the scientific community about intelligent design on the one hand versus evolution on the other . </s>
Furthermore , uh , what Dr. Galston said , certainly intelligent design would be an interesting thing to have in a college course on , on the history of pseudo- science and religion , that would be good . </s>
But to include it in a high school biology class would be to include for example , the theory of that—the theory of that vortices were responsible , vertexes were responsible for the earth turning on its axis . That is not a debate , it’s putting nonsense in the same classroom with science , period . Could—could I have a question from this side of the auditorium , please ? Yeah , hi , thank you very much , Howard Baruch , I’m curious why the biggest threat , uh , to us as a society in this country , that even gives us the ability to have this conversation , wasn’t touched on by either side of the panel . </s>
Uh , where right now in the Middle East we have people who wan na fly into our country and destroy our country but , you know , but nobody brought this up as a threat to our way of society , on both sides of the panel . </s>
And , just seemed to be neglected . Thank you . Uh , we’ll , we’ll have a brief comment on that , the— the motion was America is , is too damn religious , I think that probably accounts for some of the direction of that . </s>
But if anybody would like to make a brief response to that , uh , point obviously on people’s minds . We’ll take another question then . Oh , thank you . </s>
My name is Susan Harrington , and what I’m a little bit concerned about this evening is that the question for me is not is—are Americans too religious , that’s of , really of no interest to me . </s>
More important to me is is the American government too religious . Are the American schools too religious . </s>
Is the American Medical Society too religious or affected by religion . Panelists ? Barry Lynn ? I—I think , uh , Susan was , uh , addressing that issue as , as Alan and I were also that in…our—that our concern is the way in which religion has played off government and played off politics in these negative ways . Susan , don’t , don’t tell all of your free- thinker friends that I’m gon na say this but the fact that Franklin Delano Roosevelt said a prayer on D-Day over the radio , I’m not too troubled about . </s>
What I am troubled about is George W. Bush seems to have a prayer for every day from A-Day to Z-Day , and he’s happy to share it with us at all times . His ideology , shared by many of those third of Americans who are Biblical literalists , has a tremendous negative effect on the way we can do science , the very things we can study in medicine and science , so while some are coming to America to study , you’re right , Jean , it’s also true that because of our absurd policies for example on stem-cell research , we are losing some of the top scientists in this country , East and West , to other nations . Does anyone—Bill ? </s>
I really have to protest . Uh— With— with a smile . Uh…uh , one of the pieces , one of the pieces of my biography , uh , is that I was in the Clinton White House for two and a half years as his deputy , uh , deputy director for domestic policy . Uh , I have gone down with the good ship Al Gore , twice . Uh , this—you know…uh , I did not come here , I thought , for a debate about George Bush and the Bush administration . </s>
Uh— I…you know…I yield , I really do yield to no one in my opposition to this administration . But , to reason from the follies and excesses of this administration to conclusions about America , just strikes me as a syllogism with a missing middle— Well , may—may I just— And as well— </s>
I think it was— </s>
And as a well— Let me…let me just— </s>
The mod—the moderator will take charge . </s>
Bill , are you finished with your remarks , ‘cause I’d like Alan , who made the distinction between Americans and America , uh , respond , uh , if , if that’s all right and we’ll , we’ll carry on— I think I’ve made my point . Um , I’m a great admirer of all your work with Al Gore and Bill Clinton but , look , I’m the one who brought George W. Bush into this debate , and , and , how could you not ? </s>
Uh , on , on , on this particular subject , it’s , it’s , we have seen , in the last six years , uh , a , a , really a—a radical transformation , in the , in my opinion the manipulation of a , political-religious , pseudo-religious movement , uh , to serve secular ends , but to cover— I believe to serve secular political ends , but to cover it with religious language . Because , it is widely understood in this country given its religiosity , that it’s perfectly appropriate to argue about politics , but it’s not appropriate to argue about religion , as Susan Jacoby said . Once you say you’re religious then we’re all supposed to say , oh , I didn’t know , my goodness , of course I respect everything you say . It is , it seems to me , a violation of both the principles of liberal democratic debate , but even more importantly a violation of the fundamental Christian idea of rendering under Caesar what is Caesar’s , and rendering to God what is God’s . For politicians , George W. Bush and the Republican Party to try to , uh , impose undemocratically a radical agenda on the United States , bad enough . </s>
And then to cover it in religious language as a way of immunizing themselves from criticism because we all know that this is a particularly thin- skinned administration that doesn’t want the public to question what it does and what a better way to do that than to say , or to claim , that when people disagree with them , that’s religious bigotry , that’s religious prejudice and so on and so on . And that’s why— You know , Alan , Alan was— </s>
—George W. Bush is the— There—there—there was a , there was a panel— It was—there was a panel a couple of years ago at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Religion , about 7000 people show up to this thing . And if memory serves , I think Peter Steinfels was on that panel . Um , and it had to do with looking at the , uh , religious , explicit religious references and so on in the— or at least one person did—in the , in the speeches of President Clinton , and George Bush . </s>
Uh , or George Bush specifically and someone compared it to Clinton and it turned out , uh , that it was— that Bill Clinton referenced Scripture more frequently than Bush did . Which proves my point— And , and , and with—and as Bill Galston likes to say , it’s because he knows it better . </s>
Um— But at any rate it’s— the no—the notion… The notion that , the notion that you know , if we—I mean the , the political agenda that seems to be going on is because one opposes certain policies , one therefore has to oppose , uh , the fact that those promulgating these policies , uh , have strong religious beliefs . But when you—but if you favor the policies , uh , then presumably , the religious references , the use of Scripture and so on , is something to , to good ends , and I think that , uh , if we wan na blame , uh , Barry Lynn mentioned the faith-based initiative , I think , uh , the person responsible’s right here . I mean this was a—this was a Clinton administration initiative . So I think there’s a lot of , of , of strange , uh… there’s a lot of history being rewritten here about how these things wok . And I also think , Alan , you’re not—and I , then I know I’ve got ta stop here . </s>
You’re not giving the American people enough credit to sort out the use and abuse of religion in the public sphere . I mean if indeed the Bush administration were so diabolically clever as you seem to claim it is , why aren’t his , why aren’t his ratings at up at 80 percent ? Uh , his approval ratings , people have a capacity to think critically about this , give people some credit . </s>
Uh—I—Peter—oh . One question . Uh , be brief , please— Uh , I’ll—yeah , I’ll , I’ll—well I will , I’ll , I’ll forget what—I’ll , I’ll stop what I was going to say which is this is not a debate about Biblical references , I love it when people use Biblical references . It’s like , like Barry , I don’t love it when it’s an obligation to con— con—finish every speech with “God bless America.” </s>
But the reason George Bush’s ratings are down , is because you can’t keep the reality-based world away forever . This is—just call this the revenge of the reality-based world . I—I—I’d like to , I’d like to throw in a question myself because , uh , despite the sparks we’ve seen , uh , in recent moments , uh , I detected a distressing amount of agreement underlying , many of the debaters’ presentations tonight . Uh , namely there’s agreement about all kinds of bad forms of religion , there certainly were not endorsements of certain kinds of use of government and legislative fiat , uh , for religious purposes . But I’m still not certain about the question , which in some ways Bill Galston posed . </s>
Uh , if the price…of getting rid of the forms of religion that bothers us or the use of religion in conjunction with state power , or the means of getting rid of that , were to make Americans somehow or other less religious generally , pray less , read Scripture less , light Sabbath candles less , pay less attention to their religious leaders , is that the price that we think would be worth paying , and I thought Susan answered that to some extent directly in her remarks ‘cause , maybe I’m wrong , she seemed to think that that would be one way of doing it especially in regard to that one third of the country . No— But I don’t have other people—I’d like to have other people’s responses— </s>
But I’d like to—I , I didn’t say—first of all I think that’s— Okay— —that’s a false choice . I don’t think that the—I don’t think that the price we pay in , in not letting government be as involved with religion as it is in making Americans less religious at all . </s>
Uh , in fact , if you look at Europe , Alan mentioned Europe , and , and I don’t entirely agree with him about this . In Europe there is in fact much more official church-state entanglement than there has been here , all—all along . And yet Europe is indeed much more secular than it is here and probably that is the reason . </s>
So I can not imagine why anyone would think that whatever we do about church and state will make Americans personally less religious . </s>
Yeah , and , I—I thought it was interesting , important to— And I don’t—not that I , not that I care , I think less religion would be better altogether . Well , we , we— But I don’t see why it would affect , why it would affect Americans’ personal religion . </s>
I—I was sure this issue would arise , and that’s why I wanted to be on this side to point out to the audience that , we on this side can disagree with each other , on the question of whether Americans are too damn religious , and still completely agree on the question of whether America is too damn religious . </s>
That distinction just strikes me as enormously important , I am not Sam Harris , I am not Richard Dawkins , I am not—I do not object to religion . I object to public religion , the use and deliberate manipulation of religion . That it seems to me is the problem , so Peter , my answer to your question is , we’re not here to address the question you raised . The question of whether Americans are not religious enough or too re—is just not simply on the table . </s>
It’s not what we’re about . You wan na have Richard Dawkins debate John Polkinghorne or something like that , then have that debate . </s>
But that’s not our debate . Um , Alan , public religion , um , refers not just to the people that you don’t like misusing religion as you understand it . </s>
It refers quite specifically to the kinds of movements and efforts that our side has identified . </s>
That precisely involves bringing religion into the public square as a form of public religion . I think that your understanding of religion , is , is of a kind of quiet , contemplative sort where it’s all about , uh , it’s all about my own , uh , orientation . But as we all know , historically , uh , various religious traditions have strong histories of different forms of social engagement . The question is what does that engagement look like , what does it involve ? And none of the folks that we talked about , none of the efforts we talked about , called for anything like , uh , establishing a faith , anything like something like quasi- establishment , but certainly believe that there had to be this strong public witness and public presence . </s>
And I think that’s , that’s part of what—that’s why I said we’re awfully damn American , that’s what America historically has very much been about , and it’s one of the fruits…and here I think might be the one point where I agree with Susan . Uh…the fruits of free exercise . You precisely have the kind of hollowing-out of the religious traditions in Europe because of that history of church- state , which I think destroys religion over a long time when you’ve got established religion . We don’t have that , we’ve never have that . But we have people who want it . </s>
That’s the point— No , no we don’t— —I couldn’t agree with you more that— They don’t want a—they don’t want an established religion , they have too strong a stake in free exercise— Uh , could I— MAN Bill , Bill— </s>
No , the free exercise for the majority— Well , here’s—here’s what we’re going to do at this point . I would like actually to take a few more questions without getting responses , simply to get the questions , and if panelists would like to respond to one or another of them , that would be fine . </s>
There’s a question , I—I encourage people to sit in the first row so there’s a question right here , there’s a woman right here , uh , who’s eager to ask a question . And then we’ll move back to that one and then over here , let’s take , uh , three questions quickly… And please be brief with your questions too . AUDIENCE MEMBER ( female ) My name is Inga Gittelman and I have just one question . How do you define religious . </s>
You all seem to see something else . And in the end you’re all the same . Thank you . Question was , uh , that , that the definition of religion was at the , perhaps at the center of this , this debate . </s>
Hello , can I , uh , can I just— Quest—what’s— I’ve had , I’ve had this for a while , Peter— All right . </s>
Hi , uh , I’m Professor Marufi , I’m also from Fordham University . And I—I have a question , I think , one of the things that bothered me a little bit about this discussion , is that religion in my mind is a variable , it’s not a constant . So it’s very hard to answer this question . But the—what that leads me to believe , is that , the extent to which people use religion to underwrite ethics and morality , has an implication for public policy . So my question to you is , to what extent does the majority have the right , because of their religious beliefs , to dictate morality , conscience , and ethics , to people who don’t share those beliefs who might be in a minority . </s>
Good , thank you , and one more . Uh , Christopher Rizzari . My question in this debate has always been , where are the main-line churches in this debate , I think if you were to go to the Midwest , or even New Jersey , the most visible churches that you would see are the big mega-corporate churches . Where are—where’s the 150-year-old Episcopalian churches that have had white members who were involved in abolition and the civil rights movement , where are those churches in this debate . Thank you very much , I hope that in their remarks , uh , some of the—their closing remarks , some of the debaters may in fact , uh , take up some of those very good , uh , cle—questions that I’m glad we got on the floor and I’d particularly like to thank all the audience for making your questions brief . </s>
It’s now time , uh , to vote . Uh , here’s the ticket if you want to vote for the motion… you tear off the “For” from the top and slip it into the ballot boxes . If you are against the motion tear off and deposit the “Against” and if you still don’t know where you stand just put the entire ticket in the box . The ballot boxes will be given to one person…at the end of the row and passed along , please pass them quickly to your neighbor… And one of the ushers will then take the box and pass it on to the row behind you . Everyone should get a chance to vote… Please don’t reach over , wait till the ballot box gets to yourself . </s>
Uh , now , if we could do the rest of the voting , uh , quietly , if we could , if we could proceed a little bit more quietly I’d like to start with the final remarks from the panelists , beginning with the side opposing the motion . And I’d ask the panelists to please speak , uh , from their places . So first , speaking against the motion , Jean Bethke Elshtain . </s>
Uh , well , as we have learned this evening , uh , the interaction of religion and politics , is a continuing tension . It’s a dramatic story . Uh , we have our version of it , and you’ve heard a bit of that version from our side . Uh , we’ve heard some , some rather dismissive remarks and some ridicule from the other side . </s>
Uh , but I would ask you to reflect on the question of American civil society , uh , as you go forward into this evening . Uh , the fact that religious commitment , citizens who are believers , believers who are citizens , have been the backbone and the heart of American civil society historically , that we would be enormously impoverished without their commitment , in almost every area of social life . Now , the notion that somehow , when people bring their religious commitments to the public arena that means they’re trying to “dictate” their faith to the rest of us . No , they’re doing what citizens do . </s>
They’re trying to persuade you of something . Uh , they’re trying to get you to think about things a certain way , they’re trying to get you to vote a certain way . That’s what citizens do . </s>
And we should not impose some kind of penalty on those with religious convictions when they bring those convictions into public life . </s>
Now one other important point here and that is , that religion helps to provide the kind of critical self- limitation that keeps a political system from dangerous overreach . Um , that is to say , it helps to remind us ongoingly , of the dangers of a certain kind of political power , and the attempts to take over all areas of social life by saying no , wait a minute . Uh , we have free exercise in this country , certain things can not be dictated to us , and certain kinds of controls can not be applied , and that’s part of the American story too . Thank you very much , Jean Elshtain . Now , uh , with some closing remarks , uh , for the motion , Barry Lynn . </s>
Uh , I have not given a speech in the last 20 years without mentioning one person’s name , so I’ll mention it now . Uh , on Saturday I’m going down to Pat Robertson’s Regent University Law School to judge the finals of their moot court competition . So even he and I do chat on occasion . And I am never saying , that people like Pat Robertson , James Dobson , Jerry Falwell do not have a right to speak , do not have a right to go to the public forum , in which they find , uh , their voices heard . I’m just saying that if you speak so unpersuasively that you don’t…persuade people to do what you want them to do , then don’t you dare go to the government and try to get the government to force all of us to live as you would have us . </s>
And second , uh , and final point here , it goes to a question that was not addressed , yes , terrorists came to America . And we should at some point debate fundamentalism around the world . The truth in the matter in this real world , in every world , in this universe , is that when Pope—the late Pope John Paul II condemned the invasion of Iraq in the strongest possible words used by any modern Pope , and said that the American officials who made the decision to invade Iraq would have to answer directly to God , George Bush’s response was to call in a group of so-called religious right theologians two days later to come to the White House , chat with him , and explain to the press afterwards that they were convinced that this was a just war . I believe that if President George Bush had in fact done a little more intelligence-gathering , and a little less theological butt-protecting , there would be thousands of American families and tens of thousands of Iraqi families who would not be visiting their children in graveyards . </s>
It does matter . Thank you , thank you very much , Barry Lynn . And now speaking against tonight’s motion , Albert Raboteau . Um…as I hinted earlier , well , let me , let me do something first , I— I’d like to express my appreciation to the Rosenberg Foundation and its executive director , Robert Rosenberg , for this occasion . </s>
And I’d like to— </s>
Rosenkranz . </s>
Rosenkranz . I’m sorry… Rosen—Rosenkranz . Rosenkranz , I’m sorry , yeah . </s>
Can’t read my own writing . Uh , thanks also to Dana Wolfe for inviting me to participate in this debate and to Vern Calhoun and Kris Kamikawa for the arrangements which they handled so graciously . </s>
I’d like to also thank my fellow panelists for their thoughtful and cogent arguments . </s>
As I said earlier I—I feel somewhat tangential to this argument , in part because the argument was about religion , or church and state , religion and political culture . The way in which I took the question—and this partly gets at the question of what is religion— was , what’s the role of religion in terms of the American ethos the spirit of the American people . Uh , as we all know Jefferson changed Locke’s notion of the inalienable rights from life , liberty and property , to life , liberty , and the pursuit of freedom—of happiness , excuse me , pursuit of happiness . What I see as being part of the ethos of American culture , uh , and the American , direction , has been a reversal of that , those inalienable rights . That is we are back to life , liberty , and the pursuit of property . </s>
Property in terms of rampant consumerism which is what I see as the real danger to American culture and spirit today . Now let me close with , um , with three short stories , brief vignettes , which have to do I think with the possibility of religion consum—continually renewing itself and reminding people who are religious or who hear , uh , in some ways religious symbols , who aren’t totally tone-deaf to religion . Al—Al , your , your two minutes is up , if you can make the stories very quick— </s>
Okay , I’ll make them , I’ll make them very , very , very short , I’ll make , make it only two . Uh , the first one has to do with , with Abba Serapian . </s>
Abba Serapian , uh , one day was , walking down the road . It’s in the fourth or fifth century . And , um , he gives his cloak to a poor man . And as he walks on he meets another poor man who’s shivering in the cold and gives him his tunic . And then he sat down naked holding the holy gospel . </s>
Someone came along and asked him , Abba , who has taken your clothes . </s>
And he pointed to the gospel book and said , this is the robber . </s>
The last quick story , one day Abba Lott went to see Abba Joseph and said to him , Abba , as much as I am I , uh , I am unable , I practice a small rule , a little fasting , some prayer and meditation and remain quiet and as much as possible guard my thoughts . </s>
What else should I do . Then the old man stood up and stretched his hands towards heaven . </s>
His fingers became like ten torches of flame , and he said to him , if you wish , you can become all flame . </s>
Now I present those to you as two Zen-like koans for your reflection about the abilities of religion to…renew itself , to see beyond itself , and to point to something important for the human spirit . Thank you , Al Raboteau . And now , uh , speaking in support of the motion , uh , Susan Jacoby . It’s been suggested that religion creates a check against government overreaching . </s>
We wish . More often than not , it pro— can also provide an excuse for government overreaching . </s>
For overreaching in general in fact . We’ve heard a great deal in recent months about how the only strategy for liberal Democratic candidates is to fight fire with fire , by pitting liberal religious values against the dominant conservative values of the current administration . </s>
I knew that Hillary Clinton was running for President two years ago , when for the first— when the first time she said , “our Bible , ” in those pious , sanctimonious tones . “Our Bible tells us this.” </s>
The problem with this is that your Bible may tell you something else altogether , as indeed was the case with the Pope on one side and the various minister hacks Bush got together on the other . </s>
What is the Bible telling— what , telling those very religious Senators now , as they fiddle and manage not to debate while Iraq burns . I for one would like to hear a lot less about theology and a lot more about the personal moral courage that has seemed so lacking in our political process . Uh , whoever the gentlemen said , I—I do not believe we have to have a civic morality that while for many includes religion , has to be based on more than religion . </s>
Too often , referencing religion has become not a way to demonstrate personal responsibility , but a way to avoid it . And one final thing , It’s a Wonderful Life is a movie . Thank…thank you , Susan Jacoby . Uh , we’ll now have finally speaking against the motion , William Galston . It may be a movie , but it’s a little closer to reality than many of the things that Team A has presented us with this evening . </s>
Uh— Hear , hear . I , uh…I certainly , uh , you know…I , I certainly believe , uh , that there are dogmatic Biblical literalists , no question about it . I also believe , I think with good factual warrant , that there are dogmatic atheists . </s>
Quite frankly I don’t see anything to choose between them . In my presentation , I offered three arguments about the historical contribution of religion , about the current social and political engagement of religious Americans , uh , and third about religious Americans as not being a threat to our liberties . About the first of these propositions , apparently there’s no contest . Uh , about the second , apparently no contest , or at least we , we heard none . </s>
And as for the third , the only evidence that was put on the table , was a parade of horribles which as Professor Elshtain has pointed out , have been rejected by the American people themselves . The Terry Schiavo affair is a perfect case in point . A question arose , from the audience , about the rule of—the rule and role of law . </s>
Uh , I would remind everyone , that Martin Luther King was not simply appealing to conscience . He was advocating for law . In his judgment , conscience led to law , so the real issue is not law and coercion yay or nay , but rather the legitimate limits of law and coercion . </s>
I’m a professor of political philosophy , I’d be happy to debate that with you for hours on end , but that is the question . Finally , uh… Reverend Lynn referred to Thomas Jefferson , this is my peroration , Peter . Uh , and , quite appropriately . </s>
Uh , he was one of our , uh , I would say least orthodox founders . Uh , and we rightly honor him for his , uh , intellectual courage . So let me close with this quotation , from Thomas Jefferson . </s>
“Can the liberties of a nation be thought secure , when we have removed their only firm basis—a conviction in the minds of the people that these liberties are the gift of God.” Thank you very much . Thank you , William Galston , and now finally , uh , speaking for the motion , Alan Wolfe . </s>
Well , we obviously have our disagreements on this panel , we obviously have our disagreements in America , we’re deeply divided on some of these questions . But when we’re attacked , when our enemies launch an attack against us , we come together , and we unite , and we rely on our armed forces to defend us as a people . At the Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs , Colorado , a publicly-financed institution , designed to defend all Americans against their enemies , has been taken over by evangelical Christians who use every facility at the Air Force Academy in their capacity to proselytize for Jesus Christ . Lawsuits have been brought , inquiries have been brought , the practices continue . </s>
This is the danger of America being too religious . This is not permissible in our pluralistic , democratic society . Jean Elshtain says , that what religious believers want is the right to free exercise . For a certain kind of religious believer , the right to free exercise is the right to proselytize , and the right to free exercise is to proselytize in public at public institutions . Our First Amendment forbids the establishment of , of a state church , and protects the right to religious freedom . </s>
But for a certain kind of religious believer in this country , the right to exercise their freedom is constituted by the right to establish themselves as the official church in their local community , in their university , or in their public institution . Those are the dangers , it seems to me . This requires that we be extremely sensitive to paradox , that we walk fine lines . </s>
Of course we want people who are motivated by matters of conscience and by matters of faith , to make public their concerns . Of course , at least I believe , our entire political culture is enriched by the private consciences and the religious convictions of Americans , I knew that on my side of the panel , there would be people who would be probably somewhat less sympathetic to people of faith than I would be . But I wanted to use my opportunity to demonstrate , that when America becomes too damn religious , it’s bad for religion . </s>
It’s bad for people of faith . </s>
It is bad when people use faith for what are corrupt , unreligious , and for Christians , un-Christian ends , and I hope I’ve been able to persuade you of that . Thank you very much , Alan . Uh , I would in fact like to thank all the debaters , and the audience for their very good work this evening . </s>
I think we could give them another round of enthusiastic applause . </s>
Before announcing the results of the audience vote , I want to take care of a few other matters . First , the next Intelligence Squared US debate will take place on Wednesday , March 14th , 2007 , here at Asia Society and Museum . The motion to be debated is , “Global warming is not a crisis.” </s>
I’m not signing up on that one . The remaining three debates in our spring series , including that one , are all sold out . The good news is however that beginning next week , uh , Intelligence Squared US will start selling packages on-line and by phone for the fall 2007-spring 2008 series . We will be giving priority to full-season subscribers , so to avoid disappointment , you should buy those series packages immediately . </s>
In addition , tonight’s debate can be heard locally on WNYC-AM 820 , on Friday , February 23rd , at 2 p.m . Copies of some of our panelists’ books are for sale upstairs in the lobby . </s>
You can also purchase DVD’s from previous debates , here tonight or from the Intelligence Squared US website . Finally , please be sure to pick up a copy of tomorrow’s edition of the Times of London , and the Times Literary Supplement , as you leave the auditorium . </s>
And , uh , now I take— there’s not an envelope to tear open but the results of our debate , um… There seems to have been a slight swing from the “Don’t knows” to the “For the motion.” Uh , after our debaters did their best to persuade you , you voted , 70.35 percent for the motion , and 24.34 percent against the motion , and only 5.31 percent now in the “Don’t know” category . </s>
So , congratulations to all the debaters but especially for those supporting the motion . Thank you very much . </s>
I’m now going to ask , um , Robert Rosenkranz , the chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation which is the sponsor of Intelligence Squared here in the United States , who’s going to frame tonight’s debate . Bob . </s>
Thank you , Edward , and , uh , welcome , Dana Wolfe and I , uh , are very pleased to , uh , to extend a warm welcome to this evening’s debate , “Russia is Becoming Our Enemy Again.” </s>
Now this is not a debate about Russia’s domestic arrangements , and whether we approve of them . Uh , clearly , President Putin has presided over a massive transfer of wealth and influence to a new Russian elite of former KGB operatives . He’s an autocrat who wants to keep his power . Russia is pursuing a far more assertive foreign policy , disrupting oil supply when displeased by its neighbors , threatening a new arms race , attacking the US as , quote , “the main violator of freedoms and human rights.” </s>
On the back of $ 90 oil , the Russian economy is growing rapidly . </s>
The bear is well-fed and snarling . And by all accounts , the Russian public heartily approves . The question tonight though is whether a new Cold War is emerging . </s>
The most troublesome evidence is Russia’s belligerence , even when its interests and ours seem to be aligned . It’s hard to imagine that Russia wants a nuclear Iran , or a radical Islamic insurgency . So what do they hope to gain by undermining US pressure on Iran ? </s>
It’s also , uh , hard to see the advantage of discouraging foreign capital , technology and management skill . Or how it serves Russian interests to be perceived as an unreliable long-term supplier of energy . </s>
On the other hand , it’s easy to understand why Russia might be smarting from a loss of empire , and international respect . Why it might be wary about an American missile defense shield placed in its own back yard . It’s easy to see why the former oligarchs were viewed as having gained their wealth illegitimately . And it’s understandable why Russia favors economic sanctions to exert pressures in its neighborhood , particularly when sanctions are favored policy tool of ours . So it’s easy to see how Putin’s new assertiveness enhances his domestic popularity and power . </s>
Is Russia becoming our enemy again , or is it reacting in an understandable way to domestic political considerations , or perhaps to our own mistakes . Well , we have an outstanding panel to help us decide , and a very able moderator in Edward Lucas—a veteran observer of the collapse of the Soviet Union , a long-time Moscow bureau chief for The Economist , fluent in five regional languages , and the auth—author of the forthcoming book , The New Cold War , so maybe he’s not , uh , quite so neutral as he appears . Edward , the evening is yours . </s>
Well , thanks very much indeed , Bob , for your , um , gracious introduction . Now for those of you who haven’t been at one of these de—de—debates before let me just give you a brief rundown of the , um , of—of the evening . </s>
Um , the members of the teams on both sides are going to give brief eight-minute introductions to their arguments , an eight minutes which will be ruthlessly enforced from the chair . </s>
And when those are complete I’m going to have a bit of discussion among the panel , and then open up to questions and points from the audience , and at the end of that we will have two-minute summations from each member of the panel , and then a vote . </s>
And you’ll vote with these keypads , and you’re gon na get a chance to practice , ‘cause we’re gon na have a vote at the beginning , and a vote at the end . </s>
Because as someone who works at The Economist I know that statistics are much better if you can measure them over time . And this will show how opinion has shifted in the course of the debate . So we’re gon na —in the course of the debate . So we’re gon na start off with the pre-debate vote , which shows your opinions as they were before you heard the arguments . So please pick up the keypad which in almost all cases will be on the armrest on your left . </s>
But , if you’re on the right-hand…aisle , you’ll have to pick up—you don’t have a left , you have—there’ll be two keypads on your armrest and you’ll pick up one of them . And so tonight’s resolution is “Russia is Becoming Our Enemy Again.” And when I tell you to , I’d like you to press 1 , if you’re for the motion , 2 if you’re against , 3 if you’re undecided , and on no account press buttons 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 , 9 , “Go O.J.” or “question mark , ” because then something—something bad will happen . So you may begin voting now , you don’t need to talk while you’re voting , we just—it’ll just take a couple of seconds , so please , 1 for “for , ” 2 for “against , ” and 3 for “undecided , ” the panel is not allowed to vote , and I’m not going to . So , let’s see . </s>
Now , if you’ve all voted , you won’t see the result now , uh , but you will see it in the course of the evening , and it’ll be very interesting . And I’m now going to introduce—introduce the panel , although you may have very strong personal views for or against , please refrain from either giving applause or even unmannerly boos , until all six have been introduced . So for the motion , uh , Claudia Rosett , staff journalist-in-residence at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies ; Bret Stephens , foreign affairs columnist and member of the Editorial Board of The Wall Street Journal , and J. Michael Waller who’s the Annenberg Chair in International Communication at the Institute for World Politics , and also Vice President for Information Operations at the Center for Security Policy . Don’t clap . </s>
Against the motion , the Senior Fellow of the World Policy Institute and Professor of International Affairs at the New School here in New York , Nina—Nina Khrushcheva ; Robert Legvold , who’s the Marshall D. Schulman Professor of Political Science at Columbia University ; and finally Mark Medish , who’s the Vice President for Studies of Russia , China and Eurasia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace . </s>
Welcome . So , Claudia Rosett , you have eight minutes , starting now . Thank you and good evening , um… For the radio audience I’ve just placed a teapot and a teacup on the lectern . It’s a pleasure to be here this evening , thank you to our host , the Rosenkranz Foundation , to NPR . Thank you also , to—thank all of you for coming and thank you to the opposing team , for what I know will be a well-articulated argument for something we all wish were true . </s>
Unfortunately it is not . I am here to argue for the motion that Russia is becoming our enemy again . I’d like to begin with a few definitions . </s>
Russia is an enormous polity encompassing more than 140 million people , 11 time zones and a multitude of views . </s>
I’m sure that many people in this room are personally acquainted with Russians who are by no means our enemies . Uh , but inside Russia , their views count for less and less . And in speaking of Russia , we must speak increas—of the increasingly authoritarian state— In speaking of Russia in this debate tonight , the increasingly authoritarian Russian state of President Putin , of the security apparatus , and the chief and increasingly centralized and authoritarian centers of power . </s>
Um , another definition I’d like to just get into quickly that’s important is “enemy.” The American Heritage Dictionary , which seems appropriate tonight , defines “enemy” as , quote , “one who manifests malice or hostility toward or opposes the purposes or interests—interests of another . A foe ; an opponent.” </s>
Finally , no one is here tonight that Ru—to argue that Russia is right now our enemy . The motion up for debate is that Russia is becoming our enemy again . It is that direction , that becoming , that trajectory , which we are here to debate . For two benchmarks , I would like to share with a memory of a dinner in Moscow more than a decade ago . It was with someone who has experienced , then and since , firsthand , Russia’s trajectory not at a distance but has been living it . </s>
Uh , he was then optimistic , it was a dinner with a number of journalists and despite our worries , he assured us that all would be well , that Russia was heading in a good direction , that Russians could get rich doing honest business . His name was Garry Kasparov . Today , Mr. Kasparov has been pouring forth articles and giving interviews in the West warning us that Russia is becoming , indeed has become , a criminal petro- state . The model he tells us is not the old czarist autocracy , but The Godfather , the Mafia . He wants to run in the Presidential election next March , but what he recently told MSNBC is that we’re not—quote , “We’re not fighting to win elections , we’re fighting to have elections.” </s>
Okay , that may be bad for Russia , but does it mean that Russia’s government is becoming America’s enemy . Yes . </s>
We live in an age when governments tend to export their creeds , methods , and technologies—uh , and techniques , excuse me . </s>
And , um , I’d like to just invite you for a minute to imagine , engage in a little imaginary experiment , that you are a Russian democrat , a patriot , trying to warn the free world that Russia is becoming an increasingly dangerous police state . </s>
Let’s say you’re investigating the murder of a journalist and you meet in a city , say London , with an emissary of the Kremlin . You have every right to the question you wish to ask , tea is served . </s>
Would you without a second thought these days , drink that tea ? This is a picture of Alexander Litvinenko who drank it , he’s here on this deathbed , these are the effects of Polonium 210 on the human body . This—the Kremlin denies anything to do with it . </s>
Uh , this is a picture of Viktor Yushchenko , during his successful bid for the Presidency of the Ukraine , over the Kremlin’s objections , these are the effects of dioxin on the human face . The Kremlin denies anything to do with it . Uh , to get to the bottom of such stories , can we turn to the Russian media . </s>
No , not likely . They’ve been murdered , harassed , taken over , again the trajectory in the early ‘90s , when that optimistic dinner with Garry Kasparov took place , Russia had a lively press , you could quarrel with what they wrote , but they could say what they wanted to , the shutdowns and takeovers since then , and I include a very partial list— NTV , the independent TV station , ORT , all sort of coopted by government forces . The newsweekly Itogi Savonia , TV-6 , Kommersant , the list goes on . </s>
The broad narrative over this time is that there have been phases and steps forward and back , to this direction that the Russian government is taking . But , the broad arc , is that in the early 1990s , everything was up for grabs , the rules , the property , the whole thing , it was being sorted out . At this point , the shake-out has largely taken place . What do we see . </s>
The government has effectively reabsorbed the revenues coming from such oil and gas giants as Yukos and Gazprom . Uh , we’ve seen them murdering of journalists , we’ve see the targeting of businessman Mikhail Khodorkovsky , who wanted to engage on Western terms with Western business . We’ve seen the increasing control over the regions , we’ve seen the rising charade of elections with President Putin now suggesting he might want to stay on as Prime Minister . </s>
Again the rise of the authoritarian state . Again , does this make Russia our enemy . </s>
Um…yes , that’s—and the reason why is , governments such as this need enemies to justify what they do , to deflect anger and frustrations , to show that they are important and necessary . </s>
And in Russia’s—the Russ—Russia in the sense of those who now rule— In Russia’s quest to do that the real rival is the US . And , following , sort of the initial and conditional cooperation we saw in a sort of sunny phase just after September 11th— even that was problematic—Russia’s government has become increasingly hostile and confrontational . If I run out of time my colleagues are going to cover more for you , but , let’s give a few examples . Uh , Putin’s polarizing speech in February in Munich accusing the US of , quote , singling out the US , of forcing its will on the world , and accusing the US of undermining international security . Quote , “One state , the United States , has oversepped a— stepped its national borders in every way , ” he said . </s>
You can find a great many more examples of states , you can argue about US policy but , he was directing this at the US for the world to hear . </s>
Um , according to a recent statement by the US Director of National Intelligence , Russia now spies on the US nearly as much as during the Cold War . Uh , the difficulties raised for neighbor— nearby states , uh , which are inclined to be friendliest to the US , including…lobbing a missile into Georgia , fiddling with gas supplies to the Ukraine , waging cyberwar on Estonia , and , finally , Iran , where Russia has spent more than a decade over US protests transferring nuclear technology . Uh , and at the UN in Security Council efforts to do something about this has been , one of the prime obstacles , watering down resolutions , objecting , signing only when— </s>
One minute . </s>
—it may , may—it couldn’t really do much more . Oil prices . </s>
Russia has every interest in keeping those high , roiling the Middle East , making trouble that is…in—inimical to US interests . Six years ago President Bush looked into President Putin’s eyes and thought he saw a friend of the United States of America . If only . What we have been learning since then as Russia charts its course , its direction of becoming , is that in America’s dealings with the Kremlin , it is wiser as with any antagonist , foe , opponent , enemy in the making , to watch your back . </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you very much indeed , um , Claudia Rosett , for the benefit of the radio audience I should say the teapot was blue . Robert Legvold . </s>
It’s a pleasure to be with you and a pleasure to be a part of this event . I think everybody in this hall would agree that Russia today is not a US ally , not even a disaffected ally as so many of our traditional friends are . But then to claim that Russia is , or soon will be an enemy , seems to us to be both wrong , and unhelpful , almost certainly even harmful . </s>
It’s wrong because it misunderstands what Russia’s all about , and it misunderstands what motivates its foreign policy . And it’s unhelpful , maybe even harmful as I’ve said , because it almost certainly runs the risk of bringing about the behavior and the stance on Russia’s part that we fear in the first place , and not the least , not the least , by…driving home or reinforcing the extraordinary excessive suspicion of the US that radiates across not merely the political leadership but the political spectrum in Russia , and the enormously warped misinterpretation of US , uh , foreign policy and what we are all about . There’s no question , that Putin’s Russia , Putin himself has put Russia , in the forefront of the most vocal critics of US foreign policy , there’s no question that anti- Americanism within Russia , is more intense and more widespread not only than it has been at any point in the 15 years of Russian independence but well back into the Soviet period . There’s no question , that the Russian leadership and much of the political elite sees…NATO initiatives and US foreign policy initiatives as a threat to their national security , and indicate that they mean to offset them . </s>
There’s no question that what Russia’s doing on a number of issues of concern to us are contrary , is contrary to our preferences . Uh , and there is no question as Claudia has well-demonstrated , that under Putin Russia has veered from the democratic path . That makes Russia a challenge . That doesn’t make Russia an enemy . </s>
What is Russia about . I think three things . </s>
First of all a renewed voice . Russia once again wants a place at the table with the major powers . Secondly , Russia wants respect for its national interests as it defines them , not the way in which we define them . </s>
Secondly—or third , Russia wants an end to the assigned role as either a pupil or as a junior partner . As one of the Russians wrote not so long ago , “The pedagogical relationship is over , ” and Russia wants an independent role in international politics , even a leadership role . And we’re seeing it increasingly in the way in which they exert themselves as a mediator on major issues , among and between major powers . </s>
And third , or second , what it wants beyond voice , is an enhanced power and influence within the post-Soviet space . And this in two ways particularly , first of all , as a lead role in managing security within that sphere , that’s very different from acquiring real estate , and secondly aggrandizing itself economically within the post-Soviet space , and aggrandizing itself economically is very important to Putin at this point . </s>
None of this you’ll notice , suggests that Russia is easy or not a problem for us , I said challenge . Doesn’t make it an enemy , and third it wants…it wants influence over the design of an evolving international order . </s>
The first step from that is to blunt what they see as excesses in US foreign policy . That’s a problem for us . They’re not the only country in the world that wants to blunt the excesses in US foreign policy . </s>
But they then go on to talk about collective major-power responsibility in international politics , and they want to extend the circle . </s>
They mean to bring in China and India and probably beyond that . So wherein then is the problem ? </s>
What makes Russia a challenge and not an enemy . I think it is the ambiguity and the shapelessness at the very base of Russian foreign policy today . Because , the heart of Russia’s international posture today , is a unity of opposites . Russia claims it has no enemy , it has no ally . Everyone—no one is an enemy , no one is an ally , everyone is a partner , everyone is a competitor . </s>
And that leads to a behavior , which is troublesome not only for us but I think for the future of Russia in its foreign policy , a policy of trying to have its cake and eat it as well . And this and fur— furthermore is compounded by the absence of strategic vision , within Putin’s Russia , and on his part as leader . Uh , Russia foreign policy’s driven by impulses and di—and , and desires , but impulses are not a strategy . And even less are they a strategic vision . </s>
And without strategic vision Russia is not in a position to make durable , long-term strategic choices . So then , what should be our response in these circumstances . First of all , what not to do . </s>
What not to do is premature containment , and jumping to that conclusion . </s>
Not empty hectoring , not drawing red lines . </s>
Not even tough love , particularly when we have so little direct leverage in order to pursue that kind of a policy . And what to do ? A policy that would be deft , that would be coherent , that would be frank , and that would be firm , and that would follow , in my view , three guidelines . First of all to try to engage in a constructive and an effective dialogue with Russia over all issues including the most fundamental ones that concern Claudia and her colleagues as , uh , even— uh , uh , that concerns us as much as it concerns Claudia and her colleagues , that is , the basic values question and where things are going within Russia . </s>
But not posturing . And in order to get to a dialogue with Russia we have a fundamental initial problem . That is to persuade not merely Putin and people around him but a vaude —broad part of the political spectrum , that our stake in this is not an ulterior motive , that it’s genuine , and that it is direct . Secondly , I think that… uh , we want to as much as possible focus on the overlap in our core interests , and they’re very considerable , while mitigating the increasingly tension-field —uh , tension-filled differences over tactics . </s>
The core interests are , the struggle against global terrorism . </s>
Islamic extremism . The proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . </s>
And the issue that we forget about these days , that is regulating , producing stability among the nuclear haves , not merely dealing with the nuclear have-nots . This is now a multipolar nuclear world . And we need to manage it in a way that we’ve neglected for any number of years , and finally , in a still more positive note , to , uh , promote the progressive and dynamic development of the post-Soviet economies , not just Russia . The entire region , those are our common core interests , but we really do disagree often on how we go about a number of these cases , take the one that’s very much in the forefront of our mind these days , Iran . I would not for a moment— </s>
One minute— —deny that Russia and Putin and people around him , special interests around him have very self-regarding , selfish interests when it comes to developing their relationship with Iran . But at heart the problem is a different one . We agree , both Russia and the United States that we do not want a nuclear Iran . But , at the tactical level we disagree about first of all , what kind of a time- frame we’re operating in , how much time we have or not . </s>
And then secondly how we put carrots and sticks together . And the degree to which we privilege the sticks and privilege them early , that’s the kind of thing that we need to do if the core interest coordinate—if the core interest , is as I’ve said , to deny a nuclear Iran . Uh…the…the third guideline would be that we coordinate our assessment and our approach to Russia among the major countries of the West , Europe and Japan , while at the same time in our policy toward China and India , that we deny Russia the opportunity of using China and Indian against us— </s>
Robert Legvold , your time is up , I’m afraid . Thank you . </s>
I’m finished . </s>
Now just before Bret Stephens , um , continues the debate for the motion , um , if the remarks you’ve heard so far have already got you wanting to make points of your own the index cards are here held by the ushers , do attract their attention , get them to start jotting down questions you’d like to make to—or you’d like to ask and points you’d like to make , and they will then be passed to me and I will call you in due course , if I can . Bret Stephens for the motion . Well , like , uh , Claudia I wan na preface my comments by reminding , uh , all of you of what it is we are debating here . Uh , Claudia , Michael and I are not on this stage to argue that Russia is an enemy of the United States . </s>
And you as the audience are not here to vote on whether or not that proposition is true . Rather , we are here to make the case that Russia is becoming an enemy . So what’s at issue here , is the trend , the direction , the question of where all—all this is going . So let me devote my time to looking at in a very factual way , how events have unfolded in just the past year . Let me remind you that we are on the eve of the anniversary of the poisoning of , um , Alexander Litvinenko . </s>
Let me remind you also that Alexander Litvinenko was a British subject . He was murdered by a lethal dose of Pol—of Polonium 210 , which was a de facto case of nuclear homicide if not nuclear terrorism . </s>
From his deathbed , Litvinenko personally accused Vladimir Putin of ordering the sa—the assassination . </s>
Since then , Scotland Yard has pinned , uh , the murder on a Russian businessman , an ex- or if you will current FSB man , named Andre—Andrei Lugovoi . In July , the British Foreign Secretary David Miliband , noted that , quote , “The Russian government has failed to register either how seriously we treat this case , or the seriousness of the issues involved.” </s>
The Russian Foreign Ministry responded with a brush-off , that they could not understand why British would hazard its relationship with Russia , quote , “for the sake of one man.” </s>
For the sake of one man , let me remind you that , liberal democracy is constructed for the sake of one man . In a month’s time , Mr. Lugovoi , Litvinenko’s killer , is likely to be elected a member of the Russian parliament . In December of 2006 , the Kremlin pulled out— pulled the rug out from the largest foreign , uh , investment to date in Russia , which was , uh , Shell’s 20— $ 20 billion oil and gas project on Sakhalin Island , using transparently phony regulatory excuses . It happened again in June to British Petroleum . </s>
The assault on foreign investment in Russia , was the natural extension of the illegal seizure of Russia’s privately held energy assets , particularly those of Yukos and its seek— and its CEO , Mikhail Khodorkovsky , whose prison term in a Siberian , uh , labor camp , has recently been extended . In January , Mr. Putin forced the Belarusian government to sign a new gas contract , or else have its gas supplies turned off in the dead of winter . Now Belarus is not a friend of the United States , but Ukraine and Georgia are friends of the United States . And in both cases Mr. Putin had previously used what I would call pipeline warfare to threaten his neighbors , to threaten and bully his neighbors at their coldest and most vulnerable moments . Nex—in the next month , in February , a man named Ivan Safronov , a reporter for the , uh , for the Kommersant newspaper , was—or I should say fell from a fourth-story window onto the street , where he died instantly . </s>
The authorities ruled it a suicide , but most observers believe that Safronov , who had repeatedly embarrassed the Russian military with his reporting , was executed , making him the 14th such journalist killed , murdered , during Mr. Putin’s reign . The same month , a Russian court condemned nine members of the ethnic minorities’ rights group Froda , for having a quote-unquote , “unsanctioned tea” with two German students . Quote , “We were told that under the new law on NGO’s , any meeting of two or more people , with the purpose of discussing publicly important issues , has to be sanctioned by the local administration three days in advance , ” Froda’s director told London’s Daily Telegraph . </s>
The next month , in March , an American Russia analyst named Pol—named Paul Joyal , was shot outside his home in suburban Maryland , shortly after meeting a former KGB general . Four days before that shooting , on “Dateline NBC , ” Mr. Jo—Joyal had noted that , quote , “A message has been communicated to anyone who wants to speak out against the Kremlin . If you do , no matter where you are , we will find you and we will silence you in the most horrible way possible , ” end of quote . The next month , in April , Mr. Putin indicated that he intended to withdraw Russia from the Conventional Forces in Europe Treaty , one of the landmark agreements ending the Cold War . </s>
He has since indicated , that he is prepared to withdraw Russia from the 1987 Intermediate Nuclear Forces Treaty , signed by Reagan and Gorbachov . The next month , in May , um , ethnic Russians rioted in the city of Tallinn , when the Estonian government decided to remove a World War II monument to their Soviet liberators . </s>
Estonia was subject to a conv—uh , to a concerted cyber-attack , and its ambassador in Moscow was attacked by youth protesters almost certainly belonging to a neo-fascist group known as Nashi , I should remind you that Estonia is a member of NATO and the European Union . </s>
In June , Mr. Putin warned that if the US deployed just 10 ballistic missile interceptors in Poland , then Russia will , quote , “have to get new targets in Europe . Which weapons will be used , ” he said , “ballistic missiles , cruise missiles , or some completely new systems , that’s a technical matter.” </s>
In July , Mr. Putin took a vacation . </s>
In August… Um , in August , Russia detained a mainstream business journalist for the Vedomosti paper , a paper that is , uh , uh , partly owned by , by Dow Jones , on suspicious of so-called extremist activity , via a law that defines the term “extremist” so broadly that it can be used to target ordinary political critics of the Kremlin . </s>
Russia also resumed , and this is notable , a policy of sending its heavy bombers out on lower—long-range sorties , on more than several occasions , Norwegian , British , and finally American fighters have been forced to scramble into the air , in order to intercept these Russian bombers , the first time this has happened since the Cold War . In September , Mr. Putin appointed an unknown apparatchik , Mr. Vic—Viktor Zubkov , as Prime Minister , and later announced that he himself may become , uh , may—may—may become Prime Minister , um , in the next government , which is contrary to every prior promise he has made , that he would leave the political scene when his Presidential term expires . This sets the scene for the youthful Mr. Putin to remain in power for a very long time indeed . One minute . In October Mr. Putin became the first Russian leader to visit Tehran since Josef Stalin in 1943 . </s>
He said Iran’s purposes are entirely peaceful , Russia has stopped , um , cooperating with the rest of the Security Council on the UN , forcing the US to resort to the uni—to—to unilateral sanctions . And finally I would like to make one point . Just last week George W. Bush insisted in a speech , that Russia is not an enemy of the United States . </s>
Now if that does not convince this audience that our side is right , I don’t know what will . Thank you very much . Thanks very much and if you’ve filled in some cards with questions now’s a good time to pass them to the end of the row , where the ushers will , um , will collect them . </s>
Nina Khrushcheva , against the motion . </s>
Thank you very much , thank you Rosenkranz Foundation , thank you the opposers of the motion , and thank you those who vote for it and thank you , Edward Lucas . Uh , there are at least three reasons as to why Russia is not becoming an enemy , or at least shouldn’t become one . One . Today the world is no longer bipolar , in fact it’s not even multipolar , even—um , unipolar , even if some in the United States may still think it is . That is America is no longer in a position to decide who to make or not to make an enemy , even though it certainly continues to be listened to in this regard . </s>
But there are many more actors in play today , China , Middle East , Europe , whose international interests have to be considered . There is no Cold War ideological divide in which one ideology wants to take over the other , and dominate the world . </s>
Thus at present , there are no geopolitical conditions for the Cold War . Two . Despite the 11 time-zones , Russia is not a Soviet empire , to fight against . </s>
It’s not an empire at all . Although true , under Vladimir Putin , it appears Russia still has its imperial ambitions as , uh , the , uh , those who supported the motion very ably demonstrated . However the country today doesn’t have its former capabilities . It could with varying successes create an illusion of those capabilities such as testing weapons , or , um…reinstating military exercises , which actually have been very much prone to accidents . </s>
Although at times Putin tries to flex his imperial muscles , old—at—old habits die hard , obviously . Such as during the 2004 Presidential Ukrainian elections , he’s more interested in being recognized as , uh , an international player than really building an empire . </s>
But if he feels , in order to be recognized as player he needs to play an empire , he would , and he does . Three . The United States grumble about Putin’s international policy , but loudly talks about his internal policy . </s>
But actually disagreements on how to run a state is not enough to make an enemy . Just look at Saudi Arabia . While in foreign policy , the discussion actually does take place . Here I would like to quote quite commonsensical Condoleeza Rice during the talks on the US missile defense plan in Eastern Europe . And I quote . </s>
“Even though we have our differences , we have a great deal in common , because that which unites us in trying to deal with threats of terrorism , of proliferation , is much greater than the issues that divide us.” She said it in Moscow on October 12th this year . Moreover , even Dick Cheney , who came out of the Dr. Strangelove Cold War generation , and thus sees enemies everywhere , in 2006 Vilnius presentation , despite his tough talk on Putin’s backtracking on democracy said , and I quote , “None of us believes that Russia is fated to become an enemy , ” so it’s not just George Bush . There are smarter people who said that . </s>
Um , let me develop on all three points . To one , on ideological—on no ideological divide . In fact , Putin would argue that both Russia and the United States today are of the same ideology , that is democracy , and of the same economic system , which is capitalism . In essence , he feels they disagree on tactics , methodology , and implementation . The unifying context of his Presidency is that Russia will be great and strong if it continues to be a multi-party democracy . </s>
But , despite the wishes of the West , it can’t exist without a strong leader . President , Prime Minister , or wherever he chooses to continue to be . </s>
In Russia , the economy is free , he says , but the state must control its wealth . Therefore , Putin so bristles at suggestions that he’s backtracking on democracy . At the Valde discussion club , uh , meeting in Solche this September , Putin criticized the United States’ criticism as a ploy . And I quote . </s>
“We see efforts to exploit the phraseology of democracy to influence over internal politics . This is dangerous . </s>
It undermines faith in the basic principles of democracy , if you need something from us you need to talk about the substance , not to approach it from another angle . You need to re—you need to resolve Kosovo , talk about Kosovo . You need to resolve the , uh , nuclear issue from Iran , talk about Iran . Not about democracy in Russia.” To number two . </s>
On threatening so far imperial—Russia imperial ambition . Putin’s message that Russia is a great powerful and divinely ordained state , that stretches back 1000 years , and the fact that he’s there to restore its glory and its proper place in the world , is very much embraced by the Russians , as Mr. Rosenkranz indicated . At times , it may sound like boastful animosity . </s>
But this tough imperial-sounding stunt is only a logical consequences—consequence of the brutal disappointment of the Russians with the course of events since the collapse of Communism . Poverty , politic wars , crony privatization , the 1998 financial crisis , along with the humiliations , perceived and real , uh , inflicted the West , from the NATO expansion to endless preaching . As Russians see it , it is Putin’s no-nonsense rhetoric , and his firm actions both at home and abroad , that allowed— allows him , in just a dozen years , to lead the country from bankruptcy and despair to wealth and power . </s>
Which in Russia historically are thought of in imperial terms . To number three . To common interests . </s>
Putin is prepared to cooperate with the state . Even if he promptly switches to confrontation when he senses a snub , like that Cheney talk in vil— Vilnius . However , the Russian President’s and the US President’s…bickering is not about the future Cold War I think , but rather means the following , and these are my words , not theirs . </s>
We’re annoyed at each other , for either country putting itself first . Obviously , none lost superpower ambitions . For not being what the other wants it to be . But this is rather a political game , than a war , in a—an enemy public holder , while we deal with much more pressing issues that really preoccupy us , terrorism , nuclear threats , energy , security , and many , many more . </s>
In conclusion , US- Russian relations today certainly display annoyance , and some genetic Cold War-rooted suspicions . One minute— </s>
So the language of the Cold War creeps in , and is read as animosity . But there is a serious recognition that there is plenty of common interest in the oil and energy strategy talks with Iran and North Korea and many others . Let’s face it . We all need a good enemy . </s>
And while bin Laden is at large , and terrorism is still amorphous , and the fight with it is not going too well , Russia and the United States need their Cold War dance moves to pass time before they figure out what their relationship really is , or should be , when next year , the next administration , at least in America , comes in . Thank you . Thank you very much , Nina Khrushcheva . Do keep passing your questions on those little cards to the end of the aisle . And now for the motion , Michael Waller . </s>
Thank you , Edward . It’s great to be here up in Manhattan , I don’t get up here a lot but if—if I have to go back to Washington knowing that you folks ratified Dick Cheney’s views on Russia , uh , I don’t know what I’m gon na be doing for the next week but certainly Edward will have to change the lead of his article , uh , for next week . Um…first , US Presidents since George Bush the elder , President Clinton , this current President Bush have bent over backwards , to make sure that Russia doesn’t become our enemy . We’ve done practically everything possible from subsidizing their economy to looking the other way at a lot of their transgressions to make sure that , that , uh , that we don’t offend Russia , we don’t try to over…make them overreact . We don’t criticize them too harshly and so forth . </s>
And , uh…but while we were doing that we chose to look the other way , when certain elements of the old Soviet regime , uh , regained power , consolidated power with gangster interests that took advantage of the economic reforms , and seized control in the form of Vladimir Putin . </s>
And that is the former secret police , uh , the Chekists , the KGB , who have managed to take control of a formerly— of a former democratic experiment , and turn it into a dictatorship . And any secret police system in the world needs to have a foreign enemy in order to justify its own political grip on power . So , given that , it’s the will of the Putin regime itself to have the United States as an enemy , and to become an enemy of the United States in order to perpetuate itself in power . This was revealed in Kommersant Daily in , in early 2000 , after Putin became President , when Putin’s chief of staff and the state security chief Petrushev , got together and they decided the democratic institutions should not be nurtured . In fact they should be , uh , there should be a return to , to rule by force in Russia . </s>
And they recommended exceeding the Constitutional limitations on the power of the Presidency , to create this dictatorship . And to create the nec—necessary conditions not just in Russia , but in the near abroad , which is the old Sovietspeak for the , for the former Soviet empire . </s>
So there was a clandestine manipulation and , and oppression of political parties , of politicians . </s>
We saw the faces of , of , of one of the Ukrainian politicians who , who happened to run afoul of them . Another one of those politicians , Galina Starovoitova was on our editorial board , she was murdered before , before this document happened but another one of our members of our editorial board , Yuri Shekoshekin , uh , editor , very brave editor was , was poisoned to death , uh… as a—as a staunch critic of the KGB- ization of the new Russian government . </s>
This document , uh , was designed to promote Putin as the President , and to , and to wage , quote , “preventive political action.” </s>
Throughout Russia , and to plant KGB personnel , throughout the Presidency , throughout the government ministries , in control of the armed forces as it never had been before , and in control of governorships , and administrative regions across the country . </s>
At the same time there was no accountability or national reconciliation so if you look at , at South Africa after apartheid they had truth commissions to uncover the crimes of the past , or Chile , or Argentina , or El Salvador , or Poland , or East Germany , or the Czech Republic . Or so many other countries that had been under a tyrannical government , had tried to come clean and expose the secrets of the past and the—and the—and those who were responsible for committing those crimes against humanity . </s>
That was never the casein Russia . Where there was a de- Stasification campaign in East Germany against the Stasi , there was nothing of the sort in Russia . So no one has brought—been brought to trial , no one has been , been exposed or held accountable for any of the crimes of the past . And as a result of that lack of accountability , and lack of national introspection , it’s become normal among most Russians to be treated as they had been . </s>
And so there is no coming to terms with the past , no break…no de-Nazification , imagine having a , a free West Germany without de-Nazification . And allowing former Gestapo to stay in their posts , and even become President of the country , it—it’s the moral equivalent there . So , all—over time they’ve whittled away at human rights , they’ve whittled away with—at a free press and everything else . At the same time , this summer , the Russian government came out with an ideological guidelines for social studies and history for public schools in Russia . And it’s a Kremlin-imposed guideline . </s>
Putin himself addressed the teachers and the academics at the book launch , he said , “We must not allow others to impose a feeling of guilt on us.” In the Washington Post coverage of , of this event , uh , they surveyed the sto—social studies guide , they said it’s , quote , “marked by intense hostility to the United States.” </s>
And the editor of the manual , Leonid Polyakov , said “We are developing a national ideology that represents the vision of ourselves as a nation , as Russians , a vision of our own identity , and the world around us.” A paranoid , hostile , enemy-oriented identity . Stalin in these books is shown , for the teachers’ guidelines in the Russian public schools he’s shown as , quote , “the most succ—successful leader of the USSR.” And the guidelines on teaching about Stalin’s crimes are so ambiguous , that they’re not even required in Russian public schools . And the last chapter of the history guidebook…lays out a new cult of personality of the new Russian President . </s>
Quote , “We see that practically every significant deed is connected with Vladimir V. Putin.” </s>
So this cult of personality is being built , they require some foreign adversary to , to justify the repressive measures they take . Now the iconography of the old KGB has been preserved , imagine if , if after de-Nazification in West Germany , they’re—the old symbols were still preserved of the , of the , of the , of the Nazi party . Yet if you go to the Russian police stations , they have the sword and shield , that’s the old Bolshevik Cheka secret police symbol . You go to the Foreign Intelligence Services offices , they have the same symbol , you go to the FSB State Security Services , they have the same symbol . </s>
You go to the , to the state prosecutor , they have the same symbol . So that same conscious iconography of the past , where the sword was there in Drz—Felix Dzerzhinsky’s words , to , “to protect the revolution even if it came down on the heads of the innocent.” </s>
This is the type of system that Russia’s preserving . You have an out-of-control spy services , where corruption , uh…contract killings , bombings since Putin has been , uh , suc— was first state security chief and then Prime Minister , and then President . The Russian military intelligence , which feeds on paranoia , the same way it did in the Soviet times , that—that organization has not been reformed at all . </s>
Yet , that continues to feed on paranoia , uh , of the paranoia , in its intelligence reporting to the Russia military and political leadership , that the West is still a great threat . Organized crime is , is rampant in a country with a huge secret police system that could easily crush it if it wanted to . </s>
Journalists who investigate organized crime have been murdered , especially those investigating the organized crime in St. Petersburg , where Putin used to handle hard-currency operations before he came to , to , uh , Moscow . </s>
When he took power as President he stuffed the government with KGB people , to the Defense Minister , the first time in Russian history that a secret policeman had been put in charge— One minute . </s>
—of the military . Military reform has not occurred . In fact the military is modernizing , they have an intercontinental ballistic missile force , brand new , modern force , the Topol-M . They don’t need it . We’re not their enemy , they don’t need it . </s>
Right now as we’re speaking , the Yuri Dolgoruky which is a new Borei class , uh , submarine , nuclear submarine , is undergoing its sea trials now , new ballistic missile submarine , more modern than anything we have , they don’t need it . They’re building—uh , an aircraft-carrier fleet is in their budget for the next few years as well , as a power-projection force . This is not a sign of a country that’s seeking to be an ally of the West , and every sign that intends…that the intent is in the future to have the capability to be our enemy if the political climate so declares . Thank you . Michael Waller , thank you , and now against the motion , Mark Medish . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , thank you so much for coming this evening , particularly if , uh , you’re voting against the motion . </s>
I urge you to reject the motion , ladies and gentlemen . To reject it…is not at all to defend Russia , or to defend Mr. Putin . It is to be clear about US interests , and about realistic US policy options . It’s to be realistic about the complexity of the world in which we have to conduct our foreign policy . </s>
Indeed—indeed the motion is wrong for at least three main reasons in my view . First it gets Russia wrong from the standpoint of US national security interests . Whoever’s in the White House , whether a Democrat or a Republican , will have to advance those same US national security interests…many of which we share with Russia , that my colleagues have named , uh , and , and , these are absolutely vital to our national security . Uh , for example , combating nuclear pro—uh , proliferation , uh , uh , counter— counteracting Islamic extremism around the world . </s>
I’ll develop this a bit further . The second reason that the motion…is wrong , is that it lacks historical perspective , and is incorrect on its face . </s>
Russia is not the Soviet Union…the motion conflates the two , Russia could not be becoming our enemy again , this Russia has never been our enemy . So the motion is simply wrong on its face . If we were in a courtroom , I would ask the judge for a directed verdict . And I urge you to consider one too . </s>
Third , the motion is framed with a friend-versus-foe mentality , that is most likely…to lead us down the wrong path . It misunderstands the world which is much more complicated . There’s a vast middle distance . All those who are not our friends are not necessarily our enemies , and are not necessarily becoming our enemies . </s>
It’s that difficult work in the middle distance , uh…that Russia , challenges us to do . Russia’s becoming more difficult… indeed , in many , many ways . But it’s not becoming our enemy , certainly not our enemy again . We are not their enemy , they are not ours . Russia may be its own worst enemy . </s>
Indeed I think it is in many , many respects . But that does not make it our enemy . Again to go back to US national security interests , questions of this are not about metaphysics or metaphors . They’re about concrete security interests . Where we find interests in common with other countries , we must work together with them as best we can . </s>
We may have disagreements , there may be friction , there may be deep disappointments and indeed there is great disillusionment and disenchantment in the mutual relationship today . On both sides . Nevertheless that doesn’t change our core national security interests , in containing weapons of mass destruction , in limiting the proliferation of fissile materials , in strategic arms control , in stability through Eurasia… and in the Middle East and in countering Islamic extremism around the world . These are core issues , they have not changed recently for us , or for the Russians . We need to do a better job working together , to address these interests . </s>
Second , once again , the proposition simply can not be correct on its face . Russia has not been our enemy before . We are not talking here about the Soviet Union , or a return to the USSR . Or a return to the gulag…or to rule by the Communist party . </s>
So there is no “again” at play here . And I urge you to take the words seriously , the words do matter , when we vote on a motion . </s>
We don’t have a new Cold War coming . It may be a cool peace , but that’s a very important distinction . It’s disagreeable , it’s suboptimal , it’s difficult , but it’s not a war . </s>
It’s a heightened challenge . We go through this kind of debate in the United States periodically . Who lost Russia . Right ? The Red threat , we did it in—during our last political cycle , we’re doing it again now . </s>
We ought to be careful about this , we need to separate the rhetoric from the reality and the rhetoric from what are the core US national security interests , that any President and any administration will have to serve . Finally I wan na talk about the mind-set , the friend-foe problem . </s>
Because it really represents a mentality that has gotten us into more trouble , uh , in recent times , and I think we need to steer clear of it . We need , we need to pay careful attention to distinctions and details…in assessing the trend lines , lest , the friend-foe distinctions become a—a self- fulfilling prophecy . It simply need not be so . It need not be so . </s>
Regrettably there are people in Russia , who think the same way . If we were in Moscow today , I’d be debating against them . Reminding them that the US is not their enemy and is not becoming their enemy . But so too I remind you today , Russia is not becoming our enemy . </s>
There’s a vast middle distance . Lots of difficult complicated countries . China . Pakistan . Turkey . </s>
Saudi Arabia . All countries where we could have…a long discussion , about the litany…of problems , of sorrows , of mistakes , as we’ve just heard about Russia . </s>
It doesn’t make them our enemy . It doesn’t mean that they’re becoming our enemy . </s>
They are counterparts , partners with whom we have to work . We have to work on a basis of shared interests where we can find them , and we have those with Russia . We know who the real enemies are . I don’t need to remind people , in this city certainly , who real enemies of the United States are . </s>
In my view we can’t afford to shift our focus from our real enemies to our imagined ones . One minute . In sum , once again , Russia may very well be its own worst enemy , but that does not make it our enemy . </s>
Thank you very much . Well , thank you very much indeed , Mark Medish . And I would hate to think that the legendary reticence and shyness of the New Yorkers was going to prevail even on this occasion , so do , please , make yourselves known to the ushers , the ladies on the left and on the right have cards , you can fill ‘em in , make points , you don’t need to give your name if you don’t want to , I will find you just by the item of clothing which you like to be identified by . Um , if you’re from the press however we would like you to make your , um , to just identify yourself as from the press . </s>
And we’re very keen to have audience participation here and be interactive . Now , um , we can now resul—um , announce , the results of the , um , vote that you , um , cast at the beginning of the evening . And it’s this . For the motion , 41 percent . </s>
Against the motion , 23 percent . </s>
And undecided , 36 percent . So there’s everything to play for , it could go either way by the end . </s>
If you’ve made your mind up , may—if you’ve made your mind up once already you can already make it up again , as the , uh , as the discussion continues . But I’d like now just to come back to the panel and , and see if we can get a bit of discussion going here and I’d like first of all to ask Bret Stephens to come back on the point that Robert Legvold made , about how this is just Russia wanting to be heard , this is , Russia is no longer on its knees , it’s an economically successful country with a popular President , with its own view of how things should be in the world . And feeling that it really has the right to make itself heard and to have that , um , that view taken seriously , so , Bret Stephens , don’t you think there’s , there’s something in that ? </s>
All countries have the right to make themselves heard , the French make themselves heard very , very vocally and often very effectively . Um , uh , the same goes , it’s a , it’s an ordinary fact of international political life . But if you are , say , the President of a struggling young democracy called Georgia , and it is the middle of winter , and you find that there have been two simultaneous gas epxlo—uh , pipeline explosions , that are piping in , uh , gasoline supplies , uh , to your country on , on Christmas eve , that is a very different way of making yourself heard . The same happens , of course , if you , if you are Viktor Yushchenko , and you are campaigning for the Presidency of an independent country called Ukraine , which nonetheless , Vladimir Putin and his , uh , friends in the Ukraine still consider a tr—satrap of the , uh , of Russia or excuse me , um , what they , uh , wish , uh , still was the Soviet Union . And so , the way you go about dealing with Mr. Yushchenko , is by , um , administering a nearly lethal , uh , dose of dioxin , that is a very different way of making yourself heard . </s>
If you are the Poles and you are trying to export simply meat products to Russia and they , and they will not , um , and they will not allow it on rankly mercantilist grounds , that is again a very different way of making yourself heard , and it is our contention , on this side— We are not interested in making Russia another enemy , we wish…with all respect to the psychoanal— analysis on the other side , we— as , as they— as Mark rightly pointed out , we have common , we ought to have common interests . We really do have a common enemy in Islamic extremism . But facts are facts , and when Russia or rather , this Russian government , makes itself heard , it makes itself heard by bullying , by violence and by intimidation . Um , Robert Legvold , do you think that answers your point that this is not just Russia making itself heard , it’s breaking the rules and doing things in an extreme and damaging way that disrupts the neighborhood and that must be something the United States has to , uh , try and counter . </s>
I think that’s right , as my , the argument I’m making is not that Russian behavior is admirable in all respects and doesn’t pose a problem . But I am saying that the major motivation for doing this kind of thing is as I described it , and often , I think we overlook that dimension of it . My problem with the argument that’s being made by the other side right now is the risk of oversimplification . </s>
The monochromatic picture that’s being presented , which , in its characterization of Russia , carries a very high risk of generating a self-fulfilling prophecy in the first instance , and secondly , that is almost certainly going to be , uh , would , would recommend behavior on our part , that would be contrary to our national interests because of the stakes we have in being able to cooperate with Russia if we can move in that direction . Even in terms of moving Russia domestically . One of the , one of the questions that we need to ask the other side in the course of the evening , what do they wan na do about it . And what they wan na do about it , well begin telling you what the risks are of acting on their characterization of Russia , as they present it . Which is vastly oversimplified . </s>
There’s nobody in this room that wants to as Mark said defend what’s happening in Russia . Not only is it disturbing to us , there are a number of things that have happened that are utterly reprehensible . But it’s not only a black and white story . I was witness to a conversation between Steve Hadley , who is our national security advisor , uh , the principle advisor to President Bush , and Vladimir Lukin , who is the ombudsman for human rights in the Soviet Union , a position that’s appointed by the duma . </s>
Hadley’s point was…in Russia , I’m sorry . </s>
Uh , Hadley’s point was that we wish well , we believe that democracy and building democracy’s very I mean in Russia , and as a part of that a free press is crucial , and we are very disturbed over the murder of Anna , Anna Politkovskaya . Uh , and we— and it was clear that Hadley wanted a message carried back to Moscow on this story . Lukin’s response was very measured and very careful , he said we are deeply concerned about it as well in the ombudsman’s office . As I said this is an official , he’s appointed by the duma . He said that , there are— there is an investment underway , he said we’re concerned because , not only Anna Stepanova but also two other editors from Novaya Gazyeta her newspaper , have been destroyed along the way . </s>
The investment is very important to us , and he said the important thing is that at this stage the editors of Novaya Gazyeta which is one of the more open and critical newspapers , are satisfied with the way in which this—this process is proceeding . And then he finished by saying that each year the ombudsman’s office for human rights makes four awards for advancing human rights in Russia , and this year the ombudsman’s office made that award to Anna Stepanova , and to Novaya Gazyeta . </s>
Now , that’s not to deny all the other things that are very true . The crackdown on the NGO’s , the closing down particularly of electronic media . The unwillingness now to cooperate with the OSCE moving into the elections . Maybe even the suspicion that officials at the—at a senior level were involved with the murder of Litvinenko . </s>
But that’s still not a proven point , I mean , Lugovoy may be the murderer , but we don’t know that it traces directly to Putin . And there are a series of these accusations that are being made tonight , that are simply too monochromatic . Well Robert Legvold , let me— black and white— —just take—you made a very interesting point , what would the other side like to do about it , let me put that to Claudia Rosett , okay , imagine you were Secretary of State or National Security Advisor in some future administration , what would you be tell— or even President . </s>
What would you be , what , what policy would you be advocating , what should we be doing . </s>
Well , with due respect , I think the motion tonight is not what we should do…about the fact that Russia is becoming our enemy again , but is it becoming our enemy again . </s>
And , uh , so , I’m actually not going to suggest a policy in reaction tonight , but , I would like to just mention that , from the opposing side , and , again I stress , I wish they were right , but I urge you to…look at what we are presenting , and vote that they are not . Um , we’ve heard about , and I’m quoting here , “the cool peace.” “The challenge.” “The heightened challenge.” </s>
Uh , and we’ve also heard the Saudis described as a…good example of…a country that—with which we may have disagreements but they are not our enemy . That might be a good subject for a future debate . Uh— And , I would suggest that , what we’re…actually listening to here is , uh… the difficulty of figuring out what to do about the fact that , yes indeed , Russia is becoming our enemy again . Thanks very much , Claudia Rosett , and I know Mr. Rosenkranz is in the audience and I’m sure he’ll bear that in mind when he’s planning the next , uh , next schedule for debates . But I think it’s time to take a—take a question from the audience , and I’m going to , um , go for the right-hand aisle . </s>
Um , Mr. Barry Wade , if you’d like to identify yourself , um , I believe you’re wearing—yeah , down at the front here . And , uh , you’re wearing a red tie and you’ve put that on your card and that’s very good so I can see you , and a microphone is making its way to you right now , so please , sir , state your question . As I understand some remarks that Garry Kasparov has made recently on his book tour in the United States , uh , he charges Putin with , essentially devoting his administration to the support of oil prices , and creating turmoil throughout the world , for the specific purpose of increasing oil prices , essentially so that he and his friends can pocket the money . That it’s really about the money , it’s not about geopolitics . </s>
My question is , is Kasparov correct and if so what does that say about tonight’s proposition . That’s an excellent question , I’m gon na give it first of all to Nina Khruschcheva . What do you think about , uh , Garry Kasparov’s analysis of what’s happening . </s>
Um , well , Garry Kasparov is…speaking and very popular in the West , he is very much , uh , called for , his opinions are called for . Um , not so much in Russia and in fact I must say that for a lot of Russian observers , in fact , uh…Garry Kasparov often becomes a nuisance because he also simplifies the real problem that Russia faces and , uh , uh , takes away attention from , um , detailed policies that , that could be , uh , presented and , um… and designed . As for this assumption , I have to say I sort of agree with them , that , uh , Putin’s Russia is quite a bit about money , I mean , Khodorkovsky’s story , Mikhail Khodorkovsky’s story , as the Russian saying goes , they broke the YUKOS company just to give Putin , um , um…the , the dowry for his daughters . Uh , so that’s—I mean it’s , it’s oversimplification probably but the money certainly is a huge , huge , uh , huge part of , of , uh , the Putin story . </s>
However , it’s not exactly part of that . Because , um , Putin also , uh , tries to establish the Russian ideology , as—well not the Russian ideology , sort of reestablish the , um , the , um , greatness of the Russian state , and I think that he’s very much preoccupied with . And he—he believes that the state needs money to do that so I’m not quite sure that , uh , all the Kasparov’s assumption that it all goes to him personally is quite correct , I think they do put it , uh , to , uh , to work into sort of creating , uh , the state strength . So , um , as , uh , my , um… colleague suggested , in discussing Russia we need not to , uh , look at black and white and , and , uh , and simplification but really see it , um , see what kind of real policies are happening and , uh , exactly what , what’s behind those decisions and policies . Well Nina Khruschcheva , thank you very much for that , let me put that point then to , um , Michael Waller , you’ve written extensively about corruption at the highest levels in Russia , and if it really is , um , just a front for corruption , all this xenophobic and imperialist rhetoric , then , isn’t in a way that— make— doesn’t that make it impossible for Russia to be our , our enemy because they’re only really interested in self-enrichment . </s>
Well… We can buy them off . </s>
Well , we really—with oil prices it’s like kinda hard to find a—a better way to buy them , we certainly don’t have any influence with them with our loans anymore with the IMF . But with the , uh… In—in fact it was , uh , Boris Fyodorov the early finance minister in the democratic Russian government who waned us that , uh , don’t loan us a billion dollars from the IMF because that’s , that’s not enough to help us and it’s too much to fuel corruption . But when you look at Putin’s background where he was in St. Petersburg as a KGB guy handling foreign currency transactions , hard-currency transactions with no checks and balances , his , his qualifications were that he was a liaison officer to the East German Stasi , for several years . </s>
In fact that was his nickname in St. Petersburg , Stasi . So , so you have a—so , so Stasi comes to , to Moscow to run the Presidential Property Administration . The , the notoriously honest Boris Yeltsin administration’s property-management system , where his daughter also had great , uh , economic interests at stake . So here , he , he , he’s the money-mover , he’s the money-hider , he’s the one with the KGB contacts to , to , networks to , make sure everything can be done quietly , and efficiently . </s>
Uh , but at the same time , he’s a patriot , he does love his country . </s>
And you can have crooked patriots . And so , so , he’s using oil revenues and gas revenues to finance a huge military , uh , uh , modernization program that’s a—not a reform , not to reform the military ‘cause they still have their beatings of their troops and all of this other nonsense but it’s to modernize with force projection and with weapons of mass destruction . Um , using that currency for that , for infrastructure development , and for other things that will ensure that he and his people are kept in power , they can not leave power because if they do leave power they’ll be arrested or—or worse , because of the crimes they’ve committed . So , so , so you have sort of a , a , uh , a , uh , a , a Mobutu-type system here , uh , only Russian-style , uh , where you have a more— much more efficient administration than Mobutu ever had but unlike Mobutu , uh , Putin’s not looting everything . He’s leaving a lot , for the Russia public , for the pension system and for others so that he gets a perm—permanent support base probably for the rest of his life . </s>
Edward , let me— </s>
Yes , do— </s>
—respond to something that— —do , do , do come—Robert Legvold , do come , do come back on that . Uh , respond to what Michael’s just been saying , one of the phrases he uses , “this enormous military modernization.” Military modernization within Russia . You know what the Russian military budget is this year ? </s>
It’s $ 31 billion . </s>
You know what our military budget is , $ 430 billion . Our military budget is half the GDP of Russia , at this point . Secondly , he talked about the modernization of strategic forces including this nuclear submarine , which is be—behind schedule , it’s only one , and serious analysts on the Russian side that know this and are very critical of foreign policy in the Putin regime , like General Dvorkin , and Alexei Arbatov , are very concerned about a different kind of a problem because if we really do move in this direction where we are adversaries and we do begin again , engaging the nuclear contest , then somewhere around 2015 , Russia because of the attrition of its forces , its weakening of its strategic forces , will be forced to what is called a launch on warning policy which is very destabilizing , it’s the part of the world that we’ve forgotten about . As we concentrate on these other problems , in addressing that , we have to deal with the Russians . </s>
We are together still 90 percent of the nuclear weapons in the world when we talk about the nuclear haves , we need the Russians , not just in energy , not just in dealing with issues of regional instability and nuclear nonproliferation , or weapons of mass destruction . But indeed of working this problem of stability within the Eurasian heartland . What they’re talking about in terms of the tension in Russia’s relations with Georgia or the things that the Russians are doing with Ukraine , they’re quite right . That really is a threat . We need to work that problem . </s>
How are we gon na work the problem , Claudia says , we don’t have to talk about what the implications are of this . I’m saying , everything matters because the way you phrase this problem is not cost-free . Let me just straight back to Michael Waller , the Russian military is very weak and we’d be safer if they had more nukes . </s>
That’s sort—yeah . Well , and they’re spending their money in the , the , the nuclear weapons program with the Topol- M SS-27 ICBM , they , they boast that it can break through our missile defense systems yet they complain about how dangerous our missile defense system is . It doesn’t matter whether their submarine has had problems or it’s over schedule , they’ve laid the keels for two more of them . And the current one is at sea trials now and it is a very advanced piece of equipment and it’s a revolutionary design so it’s going to have problems . </s>
We can’t pooh-pooh these things . </s>
We can’t pretend they don’t exist . They—the , the projected military budget is to build a new strategic , long-range nuclear bomber , and long-range nuclear cruise missiles to go aboard those bombers . We can’t pretend these things away . </s>
This shows , this shows intent of the Russian political and military leadership , and it’s something that we’re going to have to grapple with , we can’t call them friends for behaving this way . But let’s—on the subject of missiles there’s an excellent question from the audience , last row , left side , Marvin D. Resnick . If you’d like to identify yourself , um…I see a hand , it’s right up at the back there , if you can , uh… Ushers are sprinting towards you with microphones . </s>
Both of them at once , it’ll be interesting who gets there first . </s>
Um , but , um…Marvin Resnick , the , um , please , please , give us your question . Do—do you ask me to repeat the question ? Um , yes , would you—I mean I can say it for you but I thought you might like to say it yourself— Oh , okay . Oh , that when we , uh , when we had détente , and , uh , the Russians , uh , withdrew militarily , we kept our missiles in Europe , ostensibly , to be directed at the Middle East supposedly . </s>
And I’m wondering if that didn’t…turn Putin , into a cynic who said well I can’t trust the United States if they’re gon na keep their missiles there , and that—that set him off on a , uh , shall I say , a right-wing course . Right . Well I think it’s very interesting in this context to look at the American missile defense bases in , um , which are planned for Poland and the Czech Republic and have been very controversial there , so let’s wrap that together , let me put that to Claudia Rosett , do you think that , um , if—how , how justified is Putin in seeing after-NATO expansion when he was promised , Russia was promised that there’d be no NATO , big NAT—NATO bases in the former Warsaw Pact countries and now here we are building two quite important ones . Aren’t the Russians justified in feeling a little bit antsy about this , a little bit par— paranoid ? Uh…I think that from the Russian point of view if anything it’s one more convenient excuse . </s>
I mean the , the—could we back up here for a minute . Um…when…the Russian government came in , building on the debris of the Soviet Union , and in many ways it is the same Russia… In fact the basic framework for many things , is the same Russia . Um , they had an enormous challenge ahead where the great hope was that they would build a genuine democratic state , and that required great concentration on internal reforms . And more and more , what we’ve been listening to , is a focus on external enemies . </s>
On ways of avoiding that kind of…of actually dealing inside . </s>
What you got instead , was this criminal state , which , is going to basically take anything that’s convenient and use it for a sort of rallying point . So , should he be concerned ? We’re not about to attack Russia . Um , and I don’t think that we’re arguing here this evening that Russia is about to physically attack the United States , we’re not worried that with their military budget they’re going to launch missiles that will hit New York next week . Uh , what we’re worried about , is that they have become a force that is antagonistic , or they are becoming increasingly antagonistic to our interests , and , could I just suggest that this is not only military . </s>
On the diplomatic front , if you follow the United Nations , Russia is over and over again at loggerheads with everything that is in the US interests , uh , both in the debate that’s gone on in Iran , uh , in the effort to enforce sanctions on Iraq they were the number-one cheaters . Uh , have done nothing about that , there’s been no investment , nothing , well , we have federal prosecutions here into people who did dirty deals . Um , and , if you go to things like the Human Rights Council , you will find Russia and its votes lining up squarely with countries that I think you can reasonably call enemies of the United States , if you would accept , you know… countries like…uh , let’s see , I’m thinking on the Human Rights Council…we get into Saudi Arabia again , but in the votes at the UN— forgive me , I need to parse out the councils , at—with more time . But , they line up with Iran , with Cuba , with Sudan , with Syria , with countries that are very much opposed to the US interests , it’s that kind of , growing…sort of , that trend— </s>
Right— —that we’re talking about tonight . Mark Medish , um , against the motion , do you wan na come back on that ? I would , I’d like to go back to the gist of the question because I think it , it , it really brings up an important point , that , that again if we were sitting in Moscow , we would hear from , from people there a long bill of particulars about how they feel that Russia has been slighted , in , in the post-Cold War period . </s>
Uh , how the US , uh , uh , advanced its interests , in an unconsultative manner , uh , um , against Russia’s interests , and you named one area , uh , of , of the forward basing of missiles , the NATO enlargement which the US had , had actually promised to rule out , uh , during the process of German unification but that , that went forward . I think it’s good that it did but it irritated the Russians . Uh , the unilateral abrogation of the ABM treaty , by the Bush administration in its first months in office . That angered the Russians , it annoyed them , the unilateralism of it in particular . </s>
The fact that promises have been made about the lifting of the Jackson-Vanek Amendment . Promises not kept . So there’s a long list on that side as well . </s>
We have a list . We need to cut through this . We need to cut through this , because these…bills of particulars , don’t actually add up to a hostile enemy relationship . We need to bear in mind , in America , that other countries are allowed to have national security interests as well . </s>
And they’re allowed to interpret those themselves . And they won’t always line up perfectly . There’ll be friction . And we’ve got ta work out issues , that are at the , at the , uh , uh , tension points . brought up . </s>
The US has a bold concept of missile defense . Well , not everybody in the world is , is comfortable with it , including amongst our European allies . </s>
And the Russians have problems with it or claim to have problems with it . I think what Secretary Rice and Secretary Gates did in Moscow , a couple of weeks ago was actually quite productive . They went there and they listened to the Russian views , as to how this project could perhaps be done better in a—in a cooperative manner , and I think they’ve made some progress in that regard . </s>
And so I—I commend the Bush administration for opening its ears , and , and trying to avoid the self-fulfilling prophecy , of believing the rhetoric . And by gosh there’s a lot of rhetoric out there . Well let me just follow up on that with another question to the people opposing the motion . Um , that there’s—I think a consensus here that the mood in Russia is quite anti-Western and a lot of the , um , propaganda or , or stands taken by the , um , the media in Russia stokes this up , we heard about textbooks , it’s , it’s in the media as well . </s>
Um , I’d like to ask Nina Khrushcheva , um , who’s , uh , speaking against the motion— Isn’t there a danger that people actually start believing this , even if this anti-Western propaganda that paints , paints America and the West as , as Russia’s enemy , even if it doesn’t , um , take effect right now when the problem is still , um , dealable with , it’s surely only a matter of time before that propaganda starts taking effect and , and we’ll—they’ll , they’ll get what they wish for . Absolutely , there is always a danger with propaganda , uh , it could be successful or unsuccessful and Putin’s propaganda is incredibly successful because as you know , not only that he has tough stands on , on , uh…uh , on America , sometimes , on , um… international debate , but he also walks around half-naked in Siberia , showing off his abs , I mean and this is the most successful propaganda you can have , all of a sudden Russia has a President that is better than James Bond . I mean that’s , uh , that is a very powerful , powerful , uh , message , and in fact , I think this message is , is also created because , um , as I think , uh , Bob mentioned , uh , the military exercises threatening as they may look , in fact they’re not really going that well , and we also know that Russia’s , um , uh , Russia’s technology or at least implementation of , of , uh , service , uh , is no longer what it was during the , the Soviet period when the training was , was good , in fact excellent , now it’s sort of all over the place so they may come up with some latest technology but they have no idea how to service it , I mean , you know , let’s face it , even KGB now has the third-rate people there , so there is a certain danger that it could happen . </s>
But , you know , I’m the only Russian here so I can speak from experience . </s>
Um , uh , Russians are only gullible to a certain extent . And , uh , when they really realize , because so far the words actually kind of correspond , whatever they wan na believe , but , the minute it stops happening , I can assure you , dissidentship will come back as it was in the ‘50s and ‘60s or what we’ve never seen before . Thanks—Nina Khrushcheva , very briefly , Bret Stephens , you come back on in , on , on , on that— On a , on a couple of points , first of all to Nina’s point , um , incompetence is not intention . If the Russians are building brand-new nuclear missile submarines which is , um , a , uh , I would say a bizarre project given the shambles of their regular forces and , uh , what their needs are , the fact that they’re not building them well or the sea trials aren’t going well , uh , doesn’t address the basic point which is that this is what they intend to do . </s>
So that’s , that’s a point that needs , uh , to be , uh , made . I wan na , um , get back to something that Mark said as well . Um , which seems… First of all , I , I’m , I’m delighted , that we have found finally a bipartisan moment where a former Clinton administration official is handsomely praising the diplomacy of , of , um , of , uh , the successors , and , and I find this one of the ironies of this conversation . Um , but this comes from a kind of school of , what , what Mark said comes from a kind of school that this is all big un— misunderstanding we have with the Russians . They have one view of the world , we have a different view of the world . </s>
We need a kind of therapy session to work through , uh , um , these kinds of misunderstandings and while that is true , uh , in some ways , I don’t think it can really account , um , either for Russian behavior , or , as Michael said , um , the efforts by two if not three American administrations to bend over backwards for , uh , um , to—and make excuses for the Putin government , in fact one of the great complaints I hear when Russian , uh , usually dissident figures come through our offices at The Wall Street Journal , they will say , why is your President constantly… forgiving , acquiescing , making excuses , for , um , uh , for Vladimir Putin . There—there’s one other point I’d like to make if I can—if I— </s>
15 seconds if you can squeeze it in . Well , it’s , it’s an issue that someone here needs to address , which is , uh , yes , the United States and Russia , um , ought to have common interests , and yet strangely the Russians seem to work at cross-purposes with what we would say at this table are their basic interests . Why are they building a nuclear reactor at Bushehr , which Mr. Putin just said he is ready to complete , which in a period of about 15 months , will create 330 kilograms of spent fuel , which can easily be reprocessed into about 50 to 60 Nagasaki-type bombs , is that the Russia interest ? Right , well we now move on to the final , um , uh , part of the , the debate , where the , um , members of the panel will be able to come back and make final points , I could see Mark Medish was itching to come in there on Michael Waller but you will have a chance in your peroration to , um…uh , to respond to him . So , we are going to go in reverse order , so the first , um , uh , person to , to conclude , um , from the side against the motion , that Russia is not becoming our enemy , is Robert Legvold . </s>
Robert . This is a country with an enormous number of major foreign policy problems , and the next administration Republican or Democrat are going to have to—is going to have to review the whole gamut of US foreign policy , not just struggle with this problem of the Iraq war . </s>
I think the last thing that we wan na do at this point , what we do wan na do is reduce the number of problems , we don’t want needlessly to add problems . As I’ve said , phrasing the issue as though Russia is becoming the enemy , which has implications for action , is not cost-free . And at a time when we have so many issues where cooperation with Russia is important , and it’s not absent , we’re getting it in a number of important respects— It’s—it is the struggle on global terrorism , there is still essentially a cooperative relationship in dealing with that problem . In addressing the questions of Islamic extremism , there is still essential cooperation in that area . And in terms of strengthening the non-proliferation regime , including the North Korean issue , there is still cooperation between our two sides . </s>
But addition on other issues like , the relationship among— One minute— —the nuclear powers , the problem of weaponization of space , that most of us are not focused on , the problem of lowering the nuclear threshold and making nuclear weapons usable , bunker- busters on our side , incorporating nuclear weapons into conventional doctrine on the Russian side…when 90 percent of the weapons are held by these two countries , Russia’s absolutely essential . </s>
Now , if we are going to make any kind of progress , it doesn’t mean that we whitewash Russia or that we put our head in the sand or that we ignore all of the issues that the other side has raised so well about the reprehensible trends within Russia . But we’re still then left with the question of how we address those isshens—issues effectively . Not in ways that give us emotional satisfaction . But in ways in which we can make some progress . The experience I have , is that if it’s done carefully and with certain segments within Russia including some that are fairly close to official circles , you can have a conversation about all of the issues that they raised . </s>
Thanks very much— And indeed the Russians are the ones that are raising these issues themselves as their critics inside— Robert Leg— Robert Legvold , your time’s up , thank you very much . </s>
Now , uh , for the motion , Claudia Rosett . </s>
Thank you . Um , I think , um , we are not debating here whether Russia is the enemy or becoming the enemy . We’re discussing whether it is becoming our enemy…it is possible for the United States to have more than one . In fact to have several . Um , and , uh , in trying to frame what we’re actually talking about , um , the issue actually isn’t what we’d do about it . </s>
That is a very important issue , it’s one worth debating and I once heard somebody say , well the first thing that we need to do is start by telling them what we need . The thing that we rather neglected to do in the 1990s . We were so busy worrying about what Russia needed , that we neglected to say , we as America need the following things . Um , uh , there have been a lot of points raised here , the one I’d most like to just…refute is , that we are cooperating in Islamic extremism . </s>
I would class in Islamic extremism the activities of Iran . A genuine terrorist-sponsoring state , I think there’s no doubt about that . And on that Russia along with China has been one of the main stumbling blocks in American efforts to actually stop that nuclear program . Uh , in the larger picture , is Russia becoming our enemy , we can discuss many ways in which Russia’s aggrieved , challenged , needs validation , peeved , upset and so on . But , we’ve heard here a list of things going badly wrong inside Russia itself . </s>
What we’ve heard effectively is there is no real check on what is happening with the power that now accrues to the Kremlin . And , the agenda that will follow is one where we’ve heard a list , as Bret gave you , of the kinds of things that come from that . They are dangerous , they are inimical to the kind of values this country stands for . </s>
And in some things they’ve been downright confrontational , singling out the US . I wan na tell you just a quick anecdote . A wonderful— In eight seconds , please . An editor of mine once explained , the difficulty with defining insider trading . </s>
He said it’s a very blurry line , when you really start parsing the cases , but if you find yourself walking around with suitcases full of cash , making calls from pay phones , you can have crossed that line . And— Claudia Rosett , your time is up— </s>
—with enemy , may I just suggest that when you find yourself running a Geiger counter over the teapot , and trying to defend obvious interests of the free world— You’ve made your point . </s>
it’s— Thank you . Uh—to the , to the people who are watching , uh , who are listening , um , on the podcast or on the radio at this point , uh , Claudia Rosett pointed at the blue teapot . </s>
Um…Nina Khrushcheva against the motion . Thank you , um , I would like to go back to what our side keeps arguing is that , um , what is the policy , what is to be done , because obviously , um , Russia is a difficult… case to defend today . </s>
So when I was thinking how I would ret up— wrap up , um , provided that there would be some , there would be no surprises , and I started looking for , um , some great American or great British diplomats , because they seem to have , uh , really a lot of say about the Soviet Union at the time . People like George Kennan and Isaiah Berlin , and actually , uh , please forgive me , would like to quote from Isaiah Berlin , who was a Russian Empire born British diplomat , political philosopher and historian of ideas . And this is a short piece , 1946 written , why the Soviet Union chooses to insulate itself . And here is the quote . It is necessary to remember that the Russians do not believe a word we say , because they think they understand us more clearly than we do ourselves . </s>
True or not , it has been centuries long convention that the west is to get them . The only way to convince them is the British , and we can say the West , or the United States today , mean no harm , is simply by not meaning any , they will always judge behavior by deeds and not words . If we follow an undeviating policy with whatever we believe right for its end , making concessions where possible , but not letting the end out of sight , and if treat the Russians as any other great power , despite their odd non-reciprocal behavior , and do not answer back despite , despite their intolerable provocation , but firmly contrive to work for whatever seems in our and the world’s crucial interest , then we may hope for success . Otherwise , the wrangle of policies will become an ideological , ultimately armed conflict , and end war , when principles equally unacceptable to liberal persons . Thank you . </s>
Nina Khrushcheva , and Isaiah Berlin , thank you very much . And uh , Bret Stephens , for the notion . Uh , none of us on this side wish to see Russia , um , as an enemy again . </s>
We are not looking for another enemy . </s>
We have enemies enough in places like Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran , and Iraq . The battle against Islamic militancy and radicalism is one that we would do , we would do better to fight alongside Russia , not at cross purposes with it . We also don’t want to needlessly antagonize Russia with rhetorical excesses . But as Vaclav Havel said , told me when I interviewed him in June , with me , “Ras- Putin , ” as he called him , becomes more and more suspicious . We have to tell him plainly what we think of his behavior . </s>
Mr. Havel has a philosophy about that , it’s called living in truth . So let’s tell Mr. Putin the truth , let’s tell ourselves the truth , the truth . We worry about the political trends within Russia , not just because we are friends of democracy , human rights , freedom , the rule of law , but because the respect the governments have for their own people tend to correlate with their attitude and behavior vis-à-vis— One minute . </s>
…the outside world . We worry about Russian behavior toward countries like Ukraine , Estonia , and Georgia , because we fear that that behavior is a harbinger for what’s in store for Europe and the United States . And we look on the trends in Russia , in Russian attitudes towards journalists , human rights groups , foreign investors , neighbors , toward their own history , and finally towards us with growing alarm . And the direction seems clear and unrelenting , and it leads us to conclude that Russia is on its way toward again becoming an enemy of the United States , and we wo n't be able to do anything to change that until we come to terms with the reality that we are facing . Thank you . </s>
Bret Stephens , thanks very much . Mark Medish ? </s>
There is no irony in my praise for , uh , the work of , of the present administration . I come from a strong bipartisan tradition in US financial policy , and I , I wish the Wall Street Journal editorial board would rediscover that part of the American heritage . On Iran policy , uh , I just wanted to mention that Russia and Israel have both reaffirmed many times that they view each other as strategic allies . After Putin’s visit to Tehran recently , he met with Ehud Olmert in Moscow , and the same statements and reassurances were made . And that , that gives me confidence , uh , that the Russians are not , are not beyond the pale on this issue , uh , but , but may in fact be part of the solution ultimately . </s>
It’s a very difficult problem . Once again , I urge you to reject this notion , rejecting it is not to defend Russia , and it’s not to defend Mr. Putin’s track record . The motion should be rejected because— One minute . </s>
…of core US national security interests . This is a question about core interests , not about metaphors or metaphysics . The proposition is wrong on its face . Russia could not be our enemy again , it , this Russia has never been our enemy . We also should avoid Manicheanism in our financial policy . </s>
We have enough real enemies , let’s not imagine new ones . Like China , Russia is a very difficult counterpart and partner . </s>
It’s not our enemy . Russia may be its own worst enemy , but that does not mean it’s becoming ours . I urge you to reject the notion . Thank you . </s>
Mark Medish , thank you very much . And finally , Michael Waller . </s>
Thank you . Not even al Qaeda is building a nuclear missile system that can wipe out our entire country . And we , some of us want to turn a blind eye to those who are doing just that program , and they’ve budgeted it out through the year 2015 . </s>
Now , we’ve had great relations at times , or common interests at times with the Bolsheviks , with our humanitarian programs after the Russian civil war , with Stalin during World War II . We even offered him the Marshall Plan aid . With , with Brezhnev and Andropov with trade , uh , and arms control , and with Gorbachev supporting glasnost and perestroika . So even at our worst parts of relations with the Soviet Union we still , which was actually communist Russia , we still had a , a common relation . It did n't take away the fact that they did want to destroy us . </s>
But , I think what the danger now is that anti-government regime propaganda in Russia is so dominant , where they have shut down a free press , they have shut down all of the radio stations in Russia that broadcast Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty , that’s US broadcasting , except three or four , so they’ve effectively silenced us . I believe they’ve silenced the BBC Russian broadcasts . And then their propagandizing their children , that we are the enemy , that Stalin was not a bad guy , that , that Russia should not be held accountable for the crimes of the Communist past . So , what the regime is teaching its children today tells us a lot about where that regime may be headed . It doesn’t need to head that way . </s>
What we need to do is call them on it , as we would call a friend or a neighbor or a wayward relative or somebody else , and try to stop them from taking this path that they’ve chosen to take . Michael Waller , thank you very much . And now , ladies and gentlemen , it’s time for you to decide who carried the day . </s>
And I hope you’ve still got your key pads here . Um , it’s on the left arm rest of your seat , unless you 're on the right , right aisle , in which case it’s on the other arm rest . So , when I tell you to , press one if you 're for the notion , two if you 're against , and three if you 're undecided . </s>
So please cast your votes now . Very good . </s>
And while those , um , are being tabulated , and uh , we’ll hear the results in a moment , I want to first of all announce a few things before thanking both the debaters and the audience . The next Intelligence Squared US debate will be on Tuesday November the 13th here at the Asia Society Museum . And the notion to be debated will be a domestic one . </s>
“It’s time to end affirmative action.” Nice , uncontroversial motion . It will be moderated by Robert Siegel , who many of you will know from NPR , and the panelists for that debate , for the notion , John McWhorter , who’s a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and columnist for the New York Sun ; Terence Pell , who’s the President of the Center for Individual Rights ; and Joseph Phillips , actor , social commentator , and syndicated columnist . </s>
On the other side , against the motion , defending affirmative action , will be Khin Mai Aung , the staff attorney at the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund ; Kimberlé Crenshaw , professor of law at UCLA and Columbia Law School , and Tim Wise , writer , activist , and educator . </s>
Now , an edited version of tonight’s Intelligence Squared US Debate can be heard locally on WNYC , which is on AM820 megahertz on Sunday November the 11th at eight o'clock p.m . So , if you really enjoyed it you can tune in and listen again . Or you can hear it for the first time . And please check your local NPR member station listings for the dates and times of broadcasts outside New York City . Um , no public appearance is complete without a plug , and copies of Robert Legvold’s book , Russian Foreign Policy in the 21st Century in the Shadow of the Past are on sale upstairs in the lobby And another plug , you can purchase DVDs from previous debates here tonight , or from the Intelligence Squared US web site . </s>
And now the debate results , very interesting . It was a bad night to be undecided . </s>
After the , um , after the debate , forty-seven percent of you were in favor of the motion , so small rise , but forty-one percent of you were against , which is a huge rise . </s>
And only twelve percent were undecided . So , I declare the motion carried but by a much smaller margin than at the beginning . </s>
So , both sides have some laurels to rest on . So , thanks very much . </s>
Good evening to you all . There would be no Intelligence Squared U.S. if not for the beneficence of our founder , the chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Well , welcome to all of you . </s>
As the regulars in this series know , typically I use the first few minutes before each debate to outline the arguments on both sides . Tonight I 'm going to do something a little different and share with you the reasons we thought that framing a debate on entitlements in intergenerational terms could shed some new light on a familiar topic . </s>
American politics has focused endlessly , if inconclusively on health care , on the uninsured , on jobs , on entitlements and on the deficit . Fault lines have been drawn between liberals and conservatives , between rich and poor . But the intergenerational aspects of these issues have barely figured in the debate . One shocking statistic is that 37 percent of those who came of age in this millennium are unemployed . </s>
When consumers lack the confidence to spend , when businessmen lack the confidence to invest and to higher , it is the young that suffer most . The health insurance debate focused on the uninsured . But think for a moment about how health insurance is priced . Almost everywhere the young pay the same premium as their more illness prone elders . A massive subsidy for the old paid for by the young . </s>
Tens of millions of young people quite reasonably said no thanks to health insurance until the government mandated that they say yes . Medicare and Social Security , Granny 's benefits are some 35 percent of the federal government -- federal government budget and are projected to increase to 40 percent in the next decade as the baby boomers retire . </s>
Health care costs are running around 16 percent of GNP compared to nine percent in other developed countries . And we have no better health outcomes to show for it . </s>
End of life care , the heroic measures taken in the final three months before a predictable end are around 25 percent of total health expenditures . We simply do n't have the money to afford the health care system we 've got . </s>
When households want to consume something today that it ca n't pay for or does n't choose to pay for , it can borrow money and pay it back with interest in the future , or it can borrow money and stiff its creditors through default , repaying debt with pennies on the dollar . It 's no different for governments . If they wo n't cut spending , and they wo n't raise taxes , they can incur debt which the young will pay for with higher taxes later , or they can stiff their creditors through inflation , repaying the debt with devalued currency . </s>
Young people are paying the costs of sluggish growth today , and they 'll be paying the costs of profligate government tomorrow . And neither political party has anything constructive to say . </s>
The Democrats do n't want to cut entitlements , and the Republicans do n't want to raise taxes to pay for them . Perhaps that 's why young people vote less than their elders . Tonight they can make up for that lapse by voting twice , before the debate and after , after they 've heard tonight 's stellar panelists address the little noticed issues of America 's intergenerational divide . </s>
And with that , it 's my privilege to turn the evening over to John Donvan and our outstanding group of panelists . Thank you . </s>
And I 'd just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz , please . True or false , Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future ? That 's what we 're here to debate , another verbal joust for Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We 're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University where our motion is this : `` Grandma 's benefits imperil junior 's future . '' </s>
Two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides , for it and against it . Only one team wins , and you , our live audience , will be choosing the winner . They will be playing for your votes . </s>
So let 's meet our panel . </s>
First , a life-long Republican who is encouraging her party to get back to basics , FOX News commentator , Margaret Hoover . Her debating partner is a real estate investor and media mogul , a chairman of U.S. News and World Report , Mort Zuckerman . Opposing them at the facing table , a doctor who went on to become chairman of the Democratic National Committee , the former governor of Vermont , Howard Dean . And joining him , an economic analyst and author of the book Age of Greed and editor of Challenge Magazine , Jeff Madrick . </s>
So this is a debate . It 's a contest . There will be winners , and there will be losers . </s>
And you , our live audience here at the Skirball Center will be making the choice who wins and loses . By the time the debate has ended , you will have been asked to vote twice , once before and once again after the debate . </s>
And the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner . So let 's go to the preliminary vote . You all have key pads at your seat . Our motion is this : `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future . '' If you agree with the motion , if you are with this team , push number one . </s>
If you disagree , you 're with this team , push number two . And if you are undecided , push number three . And what will happen is the system will lock in the votes . </s>
If you feel that you made an error , just correct it , and the system will lock in your last vote . And remember again at the end of the debate , we 're going to ask you to vote a second time . And the team that has changed the most minds , has moved their numbers the most in the course of the debate will be declared our winner . So onto round one . </s>
Round one , opening statements by each debater in turn uninterrupted . They will last seven minutes each . And first speaking for our motion , `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future , '' I 'd like to welcome to the lectern , Mort Zuckerman . </s>
Mort Zuckerman is a man -- you can make your way to the lectern . And Mort , as you go there , I just want to explain to our audience , I 'm sure they all know who you are , but you are a man who started in academia and then began to build things . </s>
You build buildings , and from those buildings , you built a fortune . And from that fortune , you became a media mogul . You are the owner of the U.S. Daily News . </s>
You are the editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report , on the Forbes list of wealthiest Americans . You do not own Forbes . </s>
But on that magazine list , you are number 188 . And I 'm just wondering if you did own it , would you get to tweak the numbers a little bit ? </s>
They were referring to my age , not my rank . </s>
Ah . Ladies and gentlemen , arguing for the motion first , Mort Zuckerman . Well , as you 've just heard , America 's in very difficult shape . </s>
And the difficult truth that we must face is that we are on the verge of an exploding public sector debt that can have a very , very negative effect on our economic future . </s>
As one cynic put it , our future is n't what it used to be . Social Security was born amid harsh times of the Great Depression , marked by unemployment , homelessness and even starvation . We then made a deal with the American workers , to wit , that nobody who paid into the system would be left empty handed . To this was added Medicare , health insurance in the mid 1960s and the protection against inflation in the 1970s . </s>
These initiatives changed the economics of old age . </s>
In a mere four decades , poverty rates among the elderly , which had been three or four times that of the general population , fell below the rates for younger Americans . To this day , social security still means the difference between poverty and economic security for millions of retirees , children and many American workers . </s>
It is the primary source of income for two-thirds of older Americans and the single most important antipoverty program for children , millions of whom live in households supported by disability , survivor or retiree beneficiaries . It creates intergenerational benefits as parents and grandparents can live independently of their working children and often become the childcare providers for children while the parents work . When Social Security began making monthly distributions in 1940 , there were 160 workers for every senior receiving benefits . </s>
Today , there are about three workers . And within two decades , there will be two . Demographic are destiny . The message could not be clearer . Social Security needs fixing . </s>
It has been fixed before . Social Security taxes have been raised 40 times since the program began , most recently in 1983 . </s>
The initial Social Security tax was two percent , split between the employer and the employee , capped at $ 3,000 of earnings , which made for a maximum tax of $ 60 . Today the tax is approximately 13 percent , capped at $ 106,800 for a maximum of tax of $ 13,234 , a multiple of 80 times the original tax . </s>
So what is to be done ? Despite the natural sympathy for those looking forward to their retirement , we can not avoid the issue of Social Security insolvency . </s>
Here are some options to deal with this problem , one , gradually raising the retirement age to reflect the longevity increases that have already taken place . </s>
In the future , retirement age should be indexed automatically to rise with longevity . Two , raising employer and employee payroll taxes by up to one percent each . Three , eliminating or gradually raising the cap on taxable payroll income , reflecting the fact that higher incomes are rising faster than the Social Security taxable earnings . Four , increasing the earliest eligible age , EEA , as it 's called , from 62 to 65 , which alone would extend the trust fund solvency by about five years . </s>
Current retirees would be unaffected . And exceptions would be made for Americans who can not work longer due to injury , ill health , or other causes . Modest reductions in benefits for wealthier recipients should also be considered . We must address these challenges soon or Grandma 's welfare will in fact undermine the quality of life for her grandchildren and give meaning to the phrase which my partner and I have found out , we 'll both , quote , `` Blessed are the young for they shall inherit the national debt . '' </s>
I might add -- -- that was originally stated by my partner 's grandfather . The greatest risk facing America 's fiscal future comes from the projected increases in Medicaid and Medicare spending that could raise the deficits dramatically in the next couple of decades . Arithmetic still matters . Medicaid now pays for both health and long term care for roughly 55 million Americans . </s>
It finances more than one third of all births in the United States , and pays the cost of almost two thirds of the people in nursing homes . </s>
The federal government underwrites 50 to 77 percent of the cost , depending on the income level of each state . Even so , Medicaid is the second biggest and fastest growing category of state spending . Costs are up more than 60 percent in the last five years and are expected to exceed $ 450 billion this year and to keep growing by about eight percent annually for the next decade . In the next -- by the mid-1930s -- 2030s , the 65 and over population will nearly double , and health care costs , which have been rising far faster than worker productivity since the end of World War II , may be completely out of control , resulting in a tidal wave of federal spending . </s>
The basic fact is that the first baby boomer statistically retired on January 1 of this year , but there are 79 million more of them . </s>
Multiply that by estimated annual benefits of $ 40,000 that they will be receiving , and you 're looking at $ 3 trillion a year just for that portion of the population . </s>
Erskine Bowles , the co-chair of the bipartisan Simpson- Bowles Commission , put it well , `` This is a fiscal crisis that is completely predictable and from which there is no escape . This concern has been shared by many , many institutions , the Post , the Washington Post , the Fed chairman , Bernanke , and countless others . Now , the only way to cut entitlement costs is to cut entitlement costs . The current programs as they play out will be unsustainable without giant tax increases or huge cuts in other government programs . We should remember as we address this problem that less is enough if it comes earlier , so the sooner the better . </s>
Now , this is a nation founded on opportunity , not entitlement , on thrift , not conspicuous consumption , on stewardship and not living for today , but taking steps to make sure that we are creating a better tomorrow , such that future generations would have as much or more opportunity and a better standard of living . </s>
To keep these entitlements under fiscal control is about keeping the American dream alive . </s>
I know the American dream because I 'm one of the people who was attracted to this country many years ago from Canada where 50 percent of the graduating class of American universities moved to the United States , attracted as we were by the remarkable energy and optimism and mobility and upward mobility of this country , not to mention the president , John Kennedy . Today it is Canada 's government that has shown best how to manage these kinds of problems as they work their way through perilous economic times without threatening its future . But much as I like Canada , I do n't want my children moving there because of the narrowing of opportunity at home . </s>
Mort Zuckerman , I’m sorry . Your time is up . Thank you . Ladies and gentlemen , Mort Zuckerman . </s>
Our motion is `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future.” And here now to speak against the motion , Jeff Madrick . He is the editor of Challenge Magazine . He is a thinker and a writer who comes to the topic of economics from the left . </s>
His most recent great pithy statement to be attributed to him is “The last thing we need right now is a tax cut.” He wrote a book called “The Age of Greed , ” which turns on its head the fictional Gordon Gecko’s notion that greed is good because greed is -- </s>
Greed is not good . </s>
Self-interest is okay . All right , ladies and gentlemen , Jeff Madrick . Now I have a lot to correct in what Mort said , not least of which is why he came to the U.S. Canada is very cold . </s>
I’m delighted to be here with Mort Zuckerman , Margaret Hoover , and , of course , doctor , governor , and chairman , Howard Dean . I’m especially delighted to be here to defend Social Security and Medicare . They are two of the greatest achievements of any kind made in America . </s>
Mort’s listed -- Please . Mort’s listed why Social Security is so important , how many elderly it keeps out of poverty . It accounts for 80 percent of 40 percent of those who are elderly . It can account for well more than half of half of those who are elderly’s income . Medicare -- think of what the elderly would be doing without Medicare . </s>
How could they possibly be paying $ 12,000 and $ 15,000 a year for health insurance ? But you know some of this . And you’re going to say , well , let’s cut them back a little bit for the sake of fiscal responsibility . I’m going to go into that in some detail . </s>
But let me remind you and let me make this very clear . Social Security and Medicare are not outrageously generous programs . The average Social Security payment is $ 14,000 . </s>
Poverty for two -- a poverty line for two is $ 13,000 . Medicare -- a typical employer-sponsored health plan will cover 88 percent of health needs . Medicare , according to independent actuarial studies , will cover 76 percent of Medicare . </s>
Big deductibles , big co-payments , not a gift . The elderly are not living wonderful lives because of Social Security and Medicare . If they’re living wonderful lives , it’s because they made a fortune , coming from Canada to America . Let me get to the point . </s>
Let me cut to the chase , because I had a lot to precede this . Let’s be very clear about what Social Security adds to our future debt . </s>
In fact , let me step back a moment . </s>
Social Security and Medicare have nothing to do with the current levels of debt -- nothing to do with it . The current levels of debt are a function of the great recession brought on , in my view , mostly due to the excesses of Wall Street , the Bush tax cuts in the early 2000s and the spending on the Iraq and Afghanistan War . </s>
Medicare Part D contributed some but less than any one of those three factors . We don’t have debt because of Social Security and Medicare . But what about the future ? You would think , given what Mort says , that Social Security accounts for about half of what’s going to happen to us . </s>
What do you think the benefits of Social Security as a proportion of GDP are going to rise to , as a proportion of our total income ? They’re now about five percent of our total income . </s>
They’re going to rise to a maximum of six percent of our total income , one percent of GDP . You think we can’t afford that ? </s>
You think Social Security is going insolvent on the basis of that ? And you know what ? Even if we don’t raise taxes to cover Social Security , Social Security is not going insolvent . The Social Security Administration and the CBO make a forecast . </s>
It is a conservative forecast of economic growth . Even if we do nothing -- and if I leave one message with you , it should be this one -- if we do nothing , we will still have 78 percent of our benefits paid by the current system . Medicare is a different story . </s>
But Medicare spending is not going up in the next 10 years significantly as a proportion of GDP . It 's going up after that . And why we hear a lot of alarmist talk about the aging of the population , true , there will be more aging compared to workers . Workers will have a harder time paying for the aged . But that 's not what 's driving Medicare costs up . </s>
That 's not what 's going to drive it sky high . It 's the health care system , an inefficient health care system . And I 'm going to leave that to my partner , Dr. Dean to discuss , how inefficient it is . Summarizing quickly on those two issues , we can handle Social Security easily . It is not going insolvent . </s>
That is inflammatory , misleading and incorrect rhetoric . Yes , I 'm getting a little upset . </s>
I think I have cause . We still pay 78 percent of liabilities . Even if we do nothing , what can we do ? </s>
We can raise the cap , as Mort suggested . We can raise the payroll taxes somewhat , 0.1 percent a year to 7.2 percent . And you know what ? All the studies , all the surveys say people want to do that . Medicare , we have to reform health care . </s>
And I hope Mort , Margaret and Governor Dean put all their effort into reforming health care because is what can undo America , not these entitlement programs . One last major point . </s>
We are a low taxed nation . We are almost the lowest taxed nation in the OECD of all rich nations . Federal income tax comes to only 15 percent of GDP these days . Used to come to 20 percent when George W. Bush took office . Can we raise taxes ? </s>
You bet we can . Ah , somebody 's going to say from the other side . </s>
But that will slow economic growth . I leave you with one fact in my last 39 seconds . George W. Bush cut taxes sharply in 2001 and 2003 . He promised growth , and he promised jobs . And all those people who talk about the poor job creators whose taxes we have to cut , consider this : We have the slowest rate of GDP growth after the Bush tax cuts from trough to peak . </s>
I mean before the devastation of late 2007 and the great recession , the slowest rate of GDP growth , 2001 to 2007 in any comparable period in post-World War II history . </s>
And job growth was even worse , almost no jobs were created after the Bush tax cuts . </s>
Jeff Madrick , your time is up . Thank you . So we are halfway through the opening round of this intelligence scared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have four debaters , two teams of two fighting it out over this motion : `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future . '' </s>
You 've heard two of the statements , and now onto the third . </s>
I 'd like to introduce Margaret Hoover , a FOX News political commentator . She is the author of a book called `` American Individualism , '' which spells out her vision for a Republican party that gets back to its roots . The title , I understand , you lifted from an author in the past , who would be whom ? I punked it from Herbert Hoover . And your relationship to Herbert Hoover ? </s>
He was my great grandfather , though I never knew him . </s>
He passed away 13 years before I was born . But you 're bringing us the past and the future tonight . I found surprisingly Hoover channels the millennial ethos . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Margaret Hoover . </s>
Thank you , John , and thanks to Bob Rosenkranz for the opportunity to participate here tonight on a stage with such distinguished public figures . I am well aware that I am the junior on this stage . And as such , I will argue in favor of this motion from the perspective of Junior whose future is imperiled by Grandma 's benefits . The juniors in this argument are the millennials . </s>
This is the rising generation in America , 30 and unders , born at beginning of the Reagan era to the end of the Clinton presidency . At 33 years of age , I am on the cusp of this rising generation and have been paying into Social Security and Medicare for eight years . I am told that as long as I pay into the system , this system will be there for me . By the time I reach my full retirement age of 67 , 34 years from now in 2045 , I 'll expect to receive the same benefits equal to that which I paid into the system . </s>
And if I have planned on this , I will find my future severely imperiled . Because eight years before I retire , the Social Security trust fund will have been depleted . </s>
I will be surprised to discover that this trust fund was actually a myth , that it was in fact just a surplus of IOUs that had been lent out to other agencies of government to pay for their expanding programs . </s>
Beginning in 2037 , Social Security will have to rely solely on the revenues from payroll taxes , which will be insufficient to cover the benefits promised to me and my generation . In addition , under current law , because of program insolvency , benefits will have to be cut by 23 percent or payroll taxes raised 30 percent . This sudden adjustment imperils the millennials economic future , affecting the poorest of those who are already dependent upon benefits . The rude awakening is that Social Security , Medicare and Medicaid were set up as pay as you go -- they were never set up as trust funds . </s>
They are pay as you go programs . The federal government does not and never has saved payroll tax revenues . These have always been generational transfer programs from workers to retirees , such that the benefits for Grandma come directly out of the pockets of Junior . By the time the first millennials reach their 40s in 2021 , the cost of Medicare alone will be greater than our country 's total defense spending . Put all together with baby boomers hitting retirement , grandmas living longer , medical costs spiraling upwards , Social Security , Medicare expenses will consume about 12 percent of the nation 's economic output in 2035 , triple what it was in 1971 . </s>
I would be remiss also if I did n't mention what we all know , which is that large parts of the federal budget are being financed by debt , 42 cents on every dollar . </s>
And this debt , too , must be paid back . By 2021 , interest payments on the debt will be a bigger portion of the budget than our discretionary funding , which will contribute to a crowding out of spending in education , infrastructure , national defense and everything else that might be considered investment in our future . </s>
We all know this is unsustainable . And the need for reform is obvious . This is not an appropriate legacy for Grandma to leave to Junior because it defies the social contract in which each generation strives to leave the country better off than it inherited it from its parents . We need to revise the social contract to reflect the changes in our society in a way that keeps the faith with Grandma , does not cut her benefits on which she is now relying , but stops making promises to Junior that we simply can not keep . We can have a generous , compassionate social welfare program for the elderly which is consistent with a dynamic economy in which workers have multiple employers over their careers , stay active and healthy in the work force into their 70s . </s>
This will require removing disincentives to longer careers , asking the more successful to shoulder more of their own retirement costs and health costs , and building stronger incentives for innovation and efficiency into our health system . Change is coming one way or the other , and it will either be deliberate , careful and well thought out , or it will be imposed by a chaotic and indiscriminate way . </s>
If we take it upon ourselves to correct the -- America 's social contract and be proactive , there will be nothing to fear from these changes . </s>
This is the normal process of each generation of Americans , improving upon the strong institutions built by earlier generations . And the millennial generations , the juniors of tonight 's motion , want to be part of that solution . You are likely to hear from our opponents an unwavering commitment to early 20th century social insurance models and an inability to adapt them and their spirit to the 21st century economy and population . They may accuse us of trying to take Grandma 's benefits away from her or suggest that we believe that the federal safety net with a mistake in the first place . </s>
This is not true . The only people who are talking about taking away Grandma 's benefits are those who want to scare seniors for political reasons . They may argue as well that entitlements , the benefits about which we are debating tonight , Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid , are not the problem at all , that the real problem for Junior is skyrocketing health care costs . This is a tricky tactic intended to shift the focus of the debate . Health care reforms are an important subject , just not the subject of tonight 's debate . </s>
The system that pays Grandma 's benefits is imperiling Junior 's future by making promises to Junior that it can not keep , by paying for these benefits through borrowing that contributes to mounting national debt , 14 trillion and counting , thus imperiling Junior 's fiscal and economic future . </s>
We encourage you to vote in favor of the motion . </s>
Thank you , Margaret Hoover . Our motion is `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future , '' and here to speak against the motion , Howard Dean , he 's a doctor who left medicine to enter politics . He ran for president in 2004 . He has served as a chairman of the Democratic National Committee , and you were governor of Vermont for 12 years , and I want to talk to you about , very briefly , about your 12 years as governor of Vermont . You came into office with a $ 62 million deficit . </s>
While there , you instituted a program that extended health care coverage to most of the kids in the state and you cut taxes . Does that mean it 's all easy because you -- Should I be on the other side of this debate ? Ladies and gentlemen , Howard Dean . </s>
Thank you . First of all , I hope to be able to match Margaret . </s>
She actually stuck to the time and that 's not so easy . She also did something else that is -- that you all have been victimized by for some time and that is frame the debate in such a way that we 're focused on giving people big tax cuts at the same time we 're focused on cutting benefits . The truth is that we do not have a Medicare and Social Security problem in terms of what it is costing us . </s>
What we have is bad management , politicians who wo n't talk to each other and work with each other , lousy tax policy , selfishness as a public policy , and growing inequality in America . This is not an issue about taxes . So a few facts , Social Security is in fact a trust fund . </s>
There are $ 2.6 trillion in the tax fund . They are invested in treasuries in the Social Security fund . By 2020 there will be $ 3.5 trillion in the Social Security trust fund set aside , put aside by you for spending by you . </s>
Is there a shortfall in Social Security ? Yes . Is that the single biggest problem of our deficit ? No . You know the single largest factor in our national debt is ? </s>
This is the CBO , this is not some leftwing democratic think tank like MSNBC . Sixty percent of the deficit in 2019 is due solely to the Bush tax cuts , 60 percent . Now , that 's a fact , I 'm not -- if you do n't want to raise taxes , be my guest , but if this is a debate between raising taxes and dealing with Social Security , you should know that because these neither of these problems is the big problem , the problem is not Social Security . I agree with Mort , there are a lot of things you can do about this . </s>
Margaret mentioned some good things you can do about Social Security . We have to tweak Social Security , yes , it 's not a big problem . </s>
Medicare , Medicare is not the problem . Its costs are out of control . There 's a reason for that . The costs of the entire health care system in the United States of America are out of control . There 's no way you 're going to control Medicare costs without doing something about the rest of the health care costs , and that means we have to have real health care reform , which we have not had . </s>
And the real health care reform has not taken place either under Romney Care/Obama Care or whatever the Republicans want to call it these days , it has not taken place because the entire reimbursement system of the health care , Medicare , or private sector , encourages me to do as much as I can to you whether it works or not , and the more I do , the more I get paid . We need to fundamentally get rid of the fee for service system , capitated care , some of the things in the health care bill such as accountable care organizations , vertically integrated care , will solve the Medicare problem , period . We do not need to privatize either one of those programs . And for those of you on Social Security , could you imagine if President Bush had has his way and we 'd privatized Social Security shortly before 2008 , I do n't think many of you would have been able to afford the $ 40 ticket that you paid to get in here . </s>
So let us not allow the right wing to focus on these two programs or the idea that we ought to reform them . </s>
Let 's reform our tax system so we have a more equal more fair society and then we can talk about how to deal with these systems . Now , what can , in fact , we do ? We talked a little bit about how to fix Medicare . </s>
We do need to start paying people in a global budget , pay the hospitals and the doctors a flat fee for taking care of people . Then , all of a sudden , guess what ? Prevention will pay . Nobody invests in prevention today except for Kaiser or self-insured major corporations . We can change all of that . </s>
There need to be some reforms , but we do not need to make this a private system , and we do not need to withdraw government support from this system . We don’t even need to reduce benefits . We do need to change the way we pay for health care , not just to save Medicare and older people . We need to save business by doing this . </s>
We need to save individuals by doing this . We fundamentally have to reform health care . Let’s not use Medicare and Social Security as the victim . The fact of the matter is that young people inevitably are going to end up as my age . </s>
And when they do , they’re not going to want these programs to disappear . The elderly used to be the poorest group in American until in 1926 the farm states where the Depression started began Social Security , which has then spread to a national program by Roosevelt in 1933 . So this is a core program . </s>
We just need to make it work and we just need some mild tweaks . Health care needs a lot of tweaks , but the whole system needs tweaks , not simply Medicare . And we should stop victimizing Medicare for the sake of keeping our taxes absurdly low . </s>
The fact is people need to pay their fair share in America , and the Bush tax cuts need to sunset . You know , when the taxes were at Bill Clinton’s rate , the economy was a whole lot better than it is now . And I wouldn’t mind going back to those taxes and paying my fair share at all . In conclusion , the solution to this problem is not to return the elderly to poverty . </s>
The elderly programs do not harm young people in this country , because if we did not have them , you would be living with them so you could take care of them at the same time as you tried to make your own lives . These programs were put in for a reason . </s>
It is a social compact . And I’ll close with the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes . Taxes are the price we pay for civilization . And for those who continue to want to avoid them more and more , seeking tax cuts when we already have enormous deficits , you will end up paying the price , because -- and I say this not as somebody who’s a liberal or on the left . I say this as a social observer . </s>
There is no society on the face of the earth now or in the past which has not collapsed when the gap between the wealthiest and the poorest in that society has become too big . </s>
We are going down a very dangerous road . And cutting Medicare and Social Security are the last things we should be doing , not the first . Thank you , Howard Dean . </s>
And that concludes opening statements and round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being argued is `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's futures.” Now , remember , keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening because , once again , at the end of the debate , we’ll ask you to vote again on the quality of the arguments . </s>
And the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner . Now , onto round two . </s>
This is where the debaters address each other directly and they answer questions from the audience and from me . We’re at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . We have two teams of two debating this motion : `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future.” </s>
You’ve heard the side arguing for this motion , saying that basically we’re looking at a mathematical inevitability . The money is simply going to run out and that at the rate we’re going , Social Security and Medicare are either going to break or they’re going to break us and that changes , significant changes are needed to avoid that outcome . The side arguing against them is saying that that doomsday scenario is greatly exaggerated , that in fact these programs are good programs , that they are generally well-managed , and that the problem is essentially at the core of medical expenses in the system , and that Social Security itself is , as structured , not really in fiscal danger . So I want to go first to the side that’s arguing against the motion and bring up the number that your opponent Margaret Hoover brought up , which is 2037 , the year 2037 , at which point , as she says , it is projected that the trust fund that was set up for Social Security is going to run dry . </s>
And this is not a number she’s pulled out of thin air . This is 2036 , 2037 , ’38 , around there . It’s generally thought that that actuarial prediction is pretty good , pretty on . So I want to put to your side , what about that ? </s>
What about the stark fact that that money will be gone ? </s>
Jeff Madrick . Let me take that . At that point , Social Security -- remember , Social Security is a pay-as- you-go system . </s>
And , Margaret , it 's not a rude awakening . It was always known to be a pay-as-you-go system . </s>
It was never said to be a trust fund . When that money runs out , money will still be coming in from workers . </s>
Enough money will be coming in , as I said earlier , to pay according to the same estimates that said the trust fund would n't run out in 2037 , to pay 78 percent of current benefits . So when people say , and you hear it all the time , and I 'd like to ask Mort what he means by insolvency and Social Security . When people say Social Security is going insolvent , and then they tell us , as we better cut the benefits now in order to save it , well , the benefits are going to be cut . And they may even be cut less without doing anything than you would like to do now . </s>
That 's what 's happened . </s>
That 's what happened -- All right . Margaret Hoover . So no one is saying we should cut benefits now , especially to the seniors to whom we have promised . There 's no one out there saying that except the AARP who is trying to scare Grandma into continuing to not vote for entitlement reform , which is imperiling Junior 's future . </s>
I want to go back to this notion that 78 percent of benefits will be paid out because when you think about it , that 's not a good deal . I put in money my entire lifetime , and then , presuming that the benefits are going to be there , I can only expect to get 78 percent out ? That 's just not a good deal for the worker . So -- did I answer the question that was -- Yeah , I think so . </s>
Do you want to go back to -- Well , let me very quickly respond . You say nobody 's calling for reductions in benefits , but of course all kinds of people are currently calling for reductions in benefits . Who ? Simpson Bowles . </s>
When you raise the -- </s>
They 're talking about reduction on future benefits , but no one . When you raise the retirement age , it 's a cut in benefits . If you raise the eligibility retirement age from 65 to 67 , that 's a cut in benefits of 13 percent . </s>
Some of the proposals out there cut benefits , in fact on 40 percent of men , some of the proposals cut benefits by 20 percent . These are proposals that are already out there . This is not a fiction . </s>
Mort Zuckerman . People are proposing that . </s>
Mort Zuckerman . That 's not the only proposals that are out there . </s>
And we 're basically talking about people just coming into the system having to deal with it . I mean , the fact is when FDR introduced Social Security , the average life expectancy was 62 . It 's now 80 . </s>
You do n't have a system that does n't take that into account unless you just want the system to go bust . </s>
So you 've got to find some way to correlate revenues and ultimately payouts . So I do n't think these are unreasonable things to have some way of -- and we 've done it . We 've done it many , many times , okay ? </s>
We did it in 1983 when Tip O'Neill as the speaker of the House , and President Reagan got together and did that , okay ? They improved the fiscal stability of that thing . </s>
We want these things to work . If you can guarantee that this thing is going to work by one magical system or another , great . But you ca n't . </s>
Howard Dean . Not with all the people who are going to be retiring , the 79 million people who -- Howard Dean . -- are baby boomers . Let me just remind everybody that the question is , do Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future . </s>
The answer is no , they clearly do n't . So we 're talking here about making some adjustments . Let me tell you what adjustments . I object to Mort 's view , even phraseology that the system will go bust . Jeff has said it will not , and Margaret 's actually said 78 percent of the benefits is a bad deal . </s>
But that is not the same as going bust . </s>
Secondly , here 's what needs to be done . Number one , wealthy pay taxes on their benefits . I think that 's a good thing . It 's a better way than means testing . I think it 's a good thing . </s>
Those taxes should go back into the social security trust fund , not go into the general fund . Number two , no matter how attractive they may be politically , do not give payroll tax cuts . That money goes into Social Security . Right now we 're simply adding it to the national debt and then putting it back in the Social Security trust fund . </s>
That is not going to help . Just let people pay into it . This is an actuarial fund , and it ought to be fully funded . </s>
Next , we need to have a different immigration policy . For all those people who are screaming and yelling about all the immigrants coming in here and screwing up the economy , look at Alabama right now where the Hispanic population is fleeing , crops are rotting in the field . </s>
Howard , can you bring this back to -- Yeah . -- to the benefits . </s>
Immigrants contribute greatly to Social Security , and the illegal immigrants contribute greatly to Social Security because they have fake social security numbers , and they never get any of that money back , so they actually boost the fund up . </s>
It 's true . And secondly , immigration built this country because if we have -- if we only have two workers paying for -- or three workers paying for what 168 used to pay for because we 're not keeping up with our birth rate , then let 's have some more talented , hard-working people come into this country and stop beating up on immigrants . If anybody in here has Native American blood in them , they 're not an immigrant . </s>
The rest of you are all immigrants , and it built this country . </s>
Let them keep building this country and keep coming . That will solve the Social Security trust fund problem . Margaret . Will it ? So you just admitted that there is a Social Security trust fund problem . </s>
Ah . And I -- Yeah . There is a Social Security trust fund problem . </s>
It is not imperiling Junior 's future . </s>
It is good for junior 's future to have Social Security . Even if the trust fund is imperiled . We had a -- </s>
We 're going to fix the trust fund if only the Republicans would get out of the way . </s>
So we need to fix it . No , no , no . But hold on . But what Governor Dean has just said that it needs to be fixed . And that is an implicit -- </s>
But it -- -- agreement with the motion . I have somewhat of the same question because -- because they put forward a series of - - the word `` tweaks '' was used . And this team stood up and used the word `` tweaks '' also . </s>
And I 'm wondering where is the daylight between your `` tweak '' sets . </s>
I was wondering that myself . </s>
I thought they were arguing our side when they started this because -- I can tell you three things I agree with Howard Dean . I agree with we need to get fee for service . Let 's just get very clear about this . </s>
All right , Jeff . Let me let Jeff Madrick -- When you start talking about the insolvency of the system , to most people out there that means you will have zero benefits when the trust fund runs out . That 's what insolvency means . </s>
When you use language like , it 's going to go bust , that means benefits are going to go down a lot . They 're not going to go down 20 percent . I see some people shaking their head . It does n't mean that . They 're not -- when you say `` bust , '' you 're talking about at least 50 percent , 60 percent . </s>
It 's an extreme exaggeration , number one . Number two , when we say `` tweaks , '' small increases in taxes can bring that benefit back up to a hundred percent . Is that a tweak that you 're good with ? </s>
Call it what you will . </s>
We have a Democratic president , Democratic control of the Senate and Democratic control of the House , and we did nothing about these issues . </s>
When you can get any kind of mix of politics -- I do n't care whether they 're the Republicans or the Democrats -- who can really change what you 're talking about changing , the tax rates , the immigration codes , you name it , I 'll agree with everything you want to say . But in the meantime , these programs are in jeopardy . And everybody who has looked at it has agreed that they are in jeopardy in one form or another . And I would therefore say to you , as long as you can sort of hypothesize these unavailable , impossible programs , sure , you can find other ways to solve it . But in the meantime , we 're living with these programs . </s>
We have n't been able to solve it , and nobody 's been able to do it since 1983 . Howard Dean . Here 's the problem with that argument . I agree . The programs are in some jeopardy . </s>
Why ? Because one side of the political aisle wants them to be in jeopardy . They 've never liked Social Security . </s>
They think the federal government should be drowned in a bathtub -- I do not think it 's fair to take away social security because there is an intransigent group of people in the House who refuse to do anything about it at all . All right . </s>
But I just want -- I want to point out that your debate opponents tonight did not take that position . That 's true , they did n't . </s>
But Mort just defended them . Thank you . </s>
Margaret Hoover . straw man . </s>
To answer Jeff 's question , insolvency , this inflammatory rhetoric is not rhetoric that Mort and I made up . In insolvency is the word used by CBO , by actuaries of Social Security . And it refers to the fact that these programs will not be able to deliver on their promises by that year 2037 . Not my inflammatory rhetoric , the rhetoric of Social Security actuaries . Now , with Governor Dean , you 've agreed that these programs are in jeopardy . </s>
To the extent that these programs are in jeopardy , you are then agreeing implicitly with the motion that those promises that have been delivered -- or that have been promised to Junior will not be able to be delivered upon , and therefore , his future is imperiled . Did she get you on that ? </s>
No . What I -- no . My opening statement was that we do n't have a Medicare and social security problem in this country . </s>
We have a political and an economic problem in this country because of bad leadership in both the business sphere and the government . So if the argument here is Social Security and Medicare , Grandma 's benefits are imperiling Junior 's future , no . The political class is imperiling Junior 's future because we have a lousy group of politicians that ca n't get their act together . I do n't think we should take that out of Grandma 's hide . What we need is new politicians , not new grandmas . </s>
Howard , I thought , though , that what I heard the other side saying is not -- they 're not talking -- they 're not talking about wanting to -- they 're not talking about wanting to cut Grandma 's benefits now . </s>
But they 're talking about wanting to cut Junior 's benefits when Junior is a grandpa , later on , they 're talking about the future , are they not ? </s>
All reforms you 're talking about cutting -- all reforms are talking in some way or other about cutting benefits now . We 've already raised the eligibility age to 67 . That 's going to be a 13 percent benefit cut . </s>
That 's not somebody way down the road . That 's a 13 percent benefit cut . Let us be honest about this . I watch television and people , supposedly forthright people , get up there and say , `` Why do n't politicians tell us there wo n't be any Social Security for us ? '' They do n't get up there and say , `` Why do n't they be honest and say we 're only going to get about 80 percent of our Social Security ? '' </s>
The words are inflammatory and sadly misleading . We can solve the problem with modest Social Security tax increases , by raising the cap , and let me talk a little bit about Medicare , Howard 's forte , because Margaret brought up the fact that this is some kind of side issue . Why do we think Medicare is going to go off the rails ? It 's not the aging issue because if it were the aging issue they would by and large rise to the same proportion of GDP as Social Security did . It 's that health care costs are rising very rapidly , and I guess we have to repeat this over and over again , rising health care costs can undue Medicare and Medicaid , down the road , not the next 10 years , but well down the road , unless we have very , very serious reform -- </s>
Okay . -- and that is not a side issue . Let 's bring Margaret in . </s>
Margaret Hoover . I agree with you . I believe we agree with you , that rising health care costs are very , very important and one of the driving predictors in long term spending of these problems . </s>
The issue here though is about benefits . </s>
And Medicare and Medicaid are health care benefits . And to the extent that health care costs are careening out of control and must be reformed , this is again an implicit affirmation of the motion that benefits are imperiling Junior 's future . I would disagree . </s>
Howard Dean . I think in fact you just affirmed our side of the motion -- -- which is the negative side . The fact is it is n't the benefits , it 's the system . If you capitated everybody 's -- It 's the same thing . </s>
No , it is certainly not the same thing . What I get in benefits has nothing to do with how I pay for those benefits . The problem is not the benefits that Grandma 's getting , the problem is the way we pay for health care in this country . You could n't be in the automobile industry -- here 's what would happen if the automobile industry were funded the way health care was , I would -- if I were Ford Motor , I would make 10 million cars a minute if I could because I 'd get paid for every single one of them . This is an insane system . </s>
There 's no -- the economic system does n't work . You have to get rid of the fee for service system . And you have to have a global budget capitated care system which -- and actually in Obama 's plan , it 's possible to do this because he 's created these integrated networks , and if you pay them a fixed amount of money , let the professionals and -- get the insurance companies out of it , let the professionals and the patients figure out how they want to save those dollars , but they do n't get additional dollars . So , Margaret , Howard 's made the case that paying and the benefits are not the same thing . So let me go to the question of Medicare benefits , do you see the need to actually reduce the level of benefit that -- </s>
I share the view just expressed that I want to completely redo the health care system , the medical profession , how they get paid , end fee for services -- -- change the whole hospital system , revolutionize the whole thing , and I 'm ready as soon as that is done to take the same approach that you 're talking about with respect to health care and Social Security . However , until then and in the slight possibility even when you were chairman of the Democratic Party that you were n't able to institute this in this country , in the slight possibility that that will not happen , let 's find something to have a fallback position just in case we ca n't revolutionize the country . Margaret , can you take on that question of whether you 're actually advocating a reduction in the benefits , the stuff you get from the doctor , the care . </s>
I actually in one sense agree with Governor Dean . I agree that the health care system needs to be reformed so that medical costs come down because I agree with the premise that it is medical costs that are careening out of control . I think Governor Dean and I have dramatically different ideas about how we would contain costs . Right , but I think they 're saying that what 's -- I think what they 're -- the words they 're putting in your mouth is saying what I 'm putting into the question is that you 're actually suggesting that people have -- there 's too much care , they 're getting too much great medical stuff , and that , that needs to be reduced as well as the cost . Well , in some sense in the medical profession there is too much care because it 's fee for service , you have -- Mort has written about tort reform , you have moved patients away from the marginal cost of their health care . </s>
And as a result , because they don’t know -- there’s no transparency . They don’t know how much they’re buying , paying for services . In addition , doctors are constantly checking boxes to cover their CYA sort of movement so that they don’t get sued . </s>
You have an enormous amount of spending in health care that is unnecessary . Howard Dean . </s>
I have to disagree with that . The fact is that incentives work . We just have bad incentives . </s>
The reason that health care costs are going up at three times the rate of inflation is not because of tort reform and all these other problems . </s>
It’s because we get paid to spend more money . Let’s say you’re a hospital executive . </s>
Right now , under the present system , you’re going to hire as many cardiologists who do catheterization , get as many MRI machines as you can because they’re huge profit centers . And you’re going to hire as few nurse practitioners and internists as you can because they don’t make you any money . We need exactly the opposite . We have an illness system here , not a wellness system . That’s the problem with our health care system . </s>
And so it actually encour -- I don’t think most doctors do this but I -- some hospital executives -- I know people who work in ERs where the CEO goes through once a month to boost up morale and says , “By the way , we’re a little short upstairs . </s>
You got to admit a few more people.” </s>
This is insane . You do not have to reduce even the quality of care . We’ve got to start keeping people well and have the money go to people who are trying to stay well and doctors and hospitals who are trying to keep people well . We’re not talking about cutting benefits because benefits are not the problem . </s>
It’s the way we pay for health care . Mort Zuckerman . No , but what you are saying , if the current system -- and I couldn’t agree with you more about the fee for services , because it’s counter to everything and more . </s>
You pay for more , not for better in that system . And I agree with that , okay . All I’m saying to you is that it is almost impossible for me to imagine that you’re going to change that , at least within my lifetime , and maybe within the lifetime of Junior . </s>
And I have a couple of young juniors . I just don’t see that happening . I hope it does . </s>
But I don’t know what it’s going to take . All I can say is I’ll give you an example . Tort reform in New York State -- a whole group of us tried to get a cap on damages of $ 250,000 as a maximum for tort liability medical issues . We couldn’t get it . But if we had gotten it , we would have saved $ 600 million a year in New York State alone , just for the hospitals . </s>
Now , it’s almost impossible to get these things done . In the meantime , I want to make sure that the health care system or the Medicare and Medicaid and the Social Security system do not break the bank , do not destroy the future of this country . When we are able to change those other things , I’ll agree with you . Jeff Madrick . </s>
We have to -- I have to make one point very clear . When you reduce Medicare benefits , you tend , except in rather narrow ways , you tend to raise health care expenditures for the rest of the country . One example , President Obama considered agreeing to raise the eligibility age of Medicare from 65 to 67 , from my point of view an outrageous move . Kaiser Family Foundation did a study about that . </s>
What happens ? Those 66- and 67- year-olds need insurance somewhere else . </s>
On average , to simplify the insurance they will pay for or their employers will pay for or the new health exchanges will pay , the price will go up . </s>
America will pay more in health care with those kinds of reforms unless we believe in triage , unless we simply say 66- and 67-year-olds , which is probably what the insurance companies would like to hear , let’s not bother getting health insurance for them . And that includes the Ryan plan . It raises health care expenditures . So this is a difficult issue . </s>
To cut back Medicare benefits significantly affects the entire health care system . Keep that in mind . Margaret , I’m a little confused about something . In the same way that you feel that you got Howard to admit that the system is in peril , that things don’t change , I think they’re getting you to admit that it’s pretty fixable , that there’s stuff you can do and you fix it and it’ll be okay again . </s>
I actually agree with that . I just have a difference -- so -- So where do you -- where’s the dividing line between these two teams ? I mean , I just think that we’re arguing this notion of benefits , and Medicaid and Medicare are benefits . </s>
And the way these benefits are structured are imperiling Junior’s future . </s>
And I think they’re saying the same thing , but they’re trying to say it’s not the benefits . It’s the health care . </s>
But the benefits are the health care . Jeff Madrick . You can not cut the benefits without raising health care -- Medicare -- health care expenditures overall . </s>
I just gave the Kaiser Family Foundation example . They said it would raise health care spending in America by twice as much as it would save Medicare . That imperils Junior’s future . If you had -- All right . </s>
I’d like to go to some questions from the audience now , and remember , when the mic comes to you , please stand up and state your name and please ask a question , and try to keep it on topic to move along discussion towards conclusion of our motion . And right down in front , yeah . The closest person to you . Yeah . </s>
If you could stand up and state your name , and we just want to give the camera a moment to find you , and it has . </s>
Yes . My name is Reba Shimanski , and I have two quick solutions to the problem . You get rid of the -- </s>
I really would like to ask you to ask a question . I 'd like them to comment . That is my question . Okay . Phrase it so that it 's a question . </s>
You remove the wage cap which now stands at 106 , 7 , $ 800 on the FICA tax and have wealthy people pay the same percentage as everyone else . Social Security would be overflowing with revenue for the next hundred years . Two , if -- you do n't take into consideration the fact that if the unemployment rate ever went down again there would be a big surge in revenue . </s>
For Medicare , the one easy solution would be for the federal government to negotiate with drug companies . </s>
And that would bring down drug prices . And that also would save Medicare costs . Okay . Also -- </s>
No , no , no . I -- I 'm going to stop you there . </s>
I 'm going to stop you there because I asked for 30 second . Thank you . </s>
Thank you . And then at the end of that , you can say , is n't that right ? Mort Zuckerman . No , I mean , look , there are all kinds of different programs , including some of them that are implicit in your question or comments . </s>
And the real problem is you have to weigh the probability of getting some of those things done . I wish we could get them done , frankly . I wish we could get toward liability . I wish we could change fee for services . </s>
I wish we could change the whole system . I have here a little cartoon from the New Yorker , just to show you . This is two -- two policemen interrogating Bernie Madoff . </s>
The lights are shining on him , and the cop says , `` All right , Madoff , where did you get the idea of paying early investors with money from late investors ? '' he says , `` From the Social Security system . '' Now , all I 'm saying is -- Wow , are you running for president from Texas , Mort ? We have to look at these things -- we have to look at these things and make them as self-sustaining financially as possible . </s>
You ca n't revolutionize the whole country to solve this problem because it 'll never get done . </s>
And we will not necessarily go broke in a total sense . </s>
But we will -- as a country , we will end up in a very , very different kind of place . Howard Dean . You know , it will get done , and it is getting done . And of course these folks on the right are going to be horrified to hear me say this , but in fact it 's happening in the private sector . Government never leads . </s>
The private sector is already -- you have Kaiser . You have Geisinger which is going to be the model for the Vermont single payer that we 're trying to put in . The private sector today is figuring out how to do capitated care and how to pay hospitals and doctors differently because the current system does n't work . Again , let me emphasize , the title of this debate is , resolved , Grandma 's benefits endanger Junior 's future . They do not . </s>
It is political bad management . It is political intransigence . It is bad economic management , but it 's not grandma 's benefits . And the private sector is doing something about it right now . </s>
Eventually , the government will figure it out . </s>
Gentleman on the aisle in the argyle sweater . And -- I encourage you to improve upon the question model . I 'll do my best , with all due respect . My -- to the person who spoke earlier . My name is Mark Turner . </s>
Okay . </s>
I think tonight and every night when you turn on the tube you can see that we have the intelligence to have this debate , but I believe our politics dummy us down . So my question is , is there a play on history going on here ? </s>
In 1980 , during the Reagan revolution , after there was a discussion about Social Security -- by 1982 , the public had spoken . Many grandmas and grandpas voted , and it got Reagan and Tip O'Neill to sit down . So maybe we should expand the table and have more juniors at the table so that their voice is going to be part of this democratic process . And -- Margaret Hoover is our junior representative . </s>
-- more juniors here to see if in fact you 'll channel the past and go for politicians who promise us a chicken in every pot and a car in every garage . I do n't think they 'll go for that . Okay . All right . </s>
You were good at the question , Mark . Thanks for the Hoover reference , too , there . </s>
You know , I could n't agree with you more . Juniors do need to be part of this debate . </s>
And the one thing that really characterizes the millennial generation is a desire to be part of the solution . But I will say when we talk about this compromise that happened with Tip O'Neill and Ronald Reagan in 1983 , we have to remember too , they were months away from seniors not getting their benefit checks . </s>
So one of the things I worry about is that politicians need their next election to be hanging in the balance before they can actually be mobilized to do anything . Howard , would you like to comment on that as well ? Yeah . I actually think that 's exactly right . But again , that 's a systemic problem , not a benefit problem . </s>
And I 'm really in favor of getting millennials to have their place at the table . And I 'm incredibly glad that they 're dancing on Wall Street right now . </s>
Woman in the green sweater , standing up . Yeah . Hi . </s>
My name is Chloe Hines , and I was just wondering if we could elaborate a little bit on what it would look like if we were creating healthier seniors , if the people who are my age and Margaret 's age and under the age of the beneficiary line , what that -- what those benefits would look like , because I feel like the pool would be depleted at a much slower rate . </s>
And I see that point being made . So I 'm wondering if we can clarify a little bit on the distinction between the health care and the benefits , because I see that happening , but it seems like it 's getting muddled up in rhetoric . If you -- Let -- let me let Mort Zuckerman go . The fact is health care has improved dramatically . </s>
That 's why longevity has improved so dramatically . So we are in fact seeing a totally different aging of the population . We had something really unique which is that there were baby boomers . </s>
We have 79 million of them coming into this system over the next several years , without going into the exact number . Their benefits alone will add $ 3 trillion a year to this thing . We 've got to find some way to make that still viable . I do n't disagree with anything you 're saying in one sense , which is that we can improve the health care system , without question . </s>
And we are improving it . And all kinds of benefits are coming from it , longevity being the first one . When we -- the original idea of health care was not necessarily to -- I mean of Social Security , was not necessarily to provide retirement income for people to the ages of 90 , whatever that new longevity will take us to . When that was passed -- as I said , the median age was 62 . That was the median longevity . </s>
We 're now at 80 . Howard Dean ? There 's nothing wrong with taking that into account . </s>
Howard . </s>
I 'll just be very quick about this . What your health care would look like is people would begin investing in your wellness at your age so that you would n't be diabetic , having dialysis , advanced atherosclerotic heart disease when you got to be my age . And so the whole -- capitated care gives a financial impetus and incentive to take care of all the people in the system when they 're young so they do n't use up more money when they 're older . </s>
Now , I am not going to get into this . End of life care is another area . </s>
And I 'm not going to get into this in a big way because it takes a lot of time . But the truth is , most seniors will make the right end of life decisions . </s>
But right now , hospitals and doctors are incentivized to stick as many tubes as they possibly can in them and you 're going out the door . All you 've got to do for that -- to fix that is not have death panels like Sarah Palin was talking about . Just turn the decisions back to the seniors by living wills and durable power of attorneys . And I hope everybody in this room has one . </s>
Okay . Can I say something ? Yeah , Jeff . I really hope the debate and what you take away from it can stick to the facts . Yes , there is greater longevity . </s>
As big a problem for the Social Security system has been the fact that wages have n't grown and that there 's inequality in America . When wages do n't grow , people put in less money into the Social Security system . When there 's inequality , a lot more people are above the cap that woman was correctly talking about . </s>
Even saying that , however , let me repeat what I said at the outset . Here were the simple numbers . For all the inflammatory language about the number of people who are getting old and longevity and the trillions of dollars and so forth , Social Security is going up from five percent to six percent of GDP . And ma'am , you are correct , we could solve that problem merely by eliminating the cap . Margaret Hoover has a look on her face that -- that I -- </s>
-- merely by eliminating the cap we would not have any deficit in the future . Margaret . I just -- it seems to me as though you 're setting up this false choice , in saying , we do n't need to save Social Security . Six percent of GDP is nothing . You know , 6 percent of GDP is more than $ 800 billion less than $ 900 billion . </s>
That 's not nothing . </s>
And for an economy that is $ 14 trillion in debt , it 's the Ben Franklin saying , if you mind your pennies , the dollars will take care of themselves . </s>
So this notion that we can just sort of ignore one and just take it is just fiscally irresponsible . Neither Howard , nor I , nor I think Mort , nor even you suggest that we should ignore the problem . We are saying the fix is not dramatic for Social Security . I do n't think I 'm even -- I think I 've said enough on that . </s>
Okay . Let me go to another question . Sir , you 're wearing a black turtleneck and you 're in the dark , if you could come down a few steps just so the cameras can see you and light up , few more steps so that I can see you though , that 's great , thanks . My name is Dan Tighe and I heard Governor Dean say that there was more than $ 2 trillion in the trust fund for Social Security , and Mr. Madrick say that there never was a trust fund , that it was always pay as you go . </s>
It seems that there 's a fundamental disagreement between the two of you . Could you clarify which of the two statements is correct ? </s>
Yeah , it 's basically a technical issue . </s>
We 've been collecting a lot more payroll taxes than we 've had to pay out . That should be a surplus in the system , a trust fund , it 's become IOUs from the federal government . People thought there should be a locked box , the federal government should never be able to spend that money . The federal government did spend that money and gave this trust fund debt . Is the federal government ever going to renege on that debt ? </s>
If it reneges on that debt , it 's going to renege on a whole lot of debt , and we have a much bigger problem -- we would have much bigger problems . </s>
So it 's really just a technical issue . A rejoinder from this side ? </s>
Well , let me just say -- Mort Zuckerman . </s>
-- when Reagan and Tip O'Neill and -- got together and restructured Social Security , we had something like $ 25 million in that trust fund . It 's now up to about $ 2.6 trillion and it 'll be about $ 3.1 trillion before we have so many more people receiving it than paying into it , that that money is basically going to disappear , and it disappears according to the best actuarial judgments at this point , in 2036 and 2037 . </s>
The whole idea is to find some way to keep that in a sense viable and liquid and not insolvent , so I think that 's basically what we 're talking about . </s>
If you do n't do anything about it now , it 's very nice to say let 's find some other way to deal with it , but frankly we 've done it 40 times , okay ? So I do n't see that this is a great issue here , and I agree , let 's lift the cap so that the wealthy pay more , et cetera , et cetera , but we 've got to keep it solvent , and we 've got to keep it solvent for a long period of time for a lot of elderly people . Ma'am , yeah , no , I 'm sorry , go back two rows , thanks , that 's right . Hi , my name is Barbara Title . Can you hold the mic a little closer to you ? </s>
Yes , my name is Barbara Title . Up until 10 years ago , the age where you could have earned unlimited earnings and still collect unemployment was 70 . Ten years ago they reduced that . Why ? I think 10 years ago at 65 or 66 you can earn unlimited money and still collect your Social Security . </s>
I think that probably it 's a technical question that 's off the topic that we 're trying to get to at the moment , unless , Jeff , you want to take this ? It was just one of many reforms that have reduced Social Security benefits . People keep talking about the Reagan-O'Neill Agreement . </s>
The Reagan-O'Neill Agreement cut benefits . It used to be that -- in that period 52 percent -- Social Security replaced 52 percent of preretirement income . </s>
So you 're saying it now replaces -- This is an average -- </s>
Jeff , you 're saying it 's a little dose of what this side is recommending be done . </s>
It 's a little dose -- yes , it 's a little does of what that side 's recommending . They also raised -- they also raised payroll taxes significantly . All right , so since we have a good example , and thanks for that question , ma'am , is that brought to your side fairly ? Well , I -- we had not frankly addressed that particular issue . What we are saying is there 's got to be some combination of factors that has to make the system viable for a much longer time than it currently is . </s>
And we think that 's important . We 've done it many times in the past . There is no problem in my judgment , no overwhelming problem in doing it now . </s>
It is true on the health care side that you have a real problem of the health care system . That is so difficult to do in the meantime , it seems to me . We 've got to make sure that these various programs do not go bust or in fact put such a burden of debt on this country that we 'll simply not be able to spend the money on so many other things whether it 's education or infrastructure or police or whatever you have to do , and that -- it 's just going to drain it . And in fact if you go from five percent of GDP to 13 percent of GDP which is where our health care costs are driving us , you 're going to take a huge amount out of what we otherwise need for the kind of country that we 'd like to think we want to have in the future . </s>
Margaret , do you want to add to that ? Yeah . What seems to be agreed upon here , and what Jeff just said , too , was that the fix is easy . We know what the fix is . </s>
And it 's true , CBO has scored 30 different fixes for Social Security . But then if we agree that there needs to be a fix , we agree that there 's a problem , and we agree that Grandma 's benefits are imperiling Junior 's future . Well , let me , if I may , we agree that there needs to be a fix and we agree that there is a problem , but the problem is not Grandma 's benefits , it 's the idiots in Washington that wo n't fix it . And we should not cut Grandma’s benefits because we have an incompetent political class . That’s what we need -- let’s not reframe this thing . </s>
This is not about Grandma’s benefits . It’s about getting people who will get stuff done in Washington and cut out the nonsense . Actually the motion does say “Grandma’s benefits.” Our fix -- you framed it wrong . Okay , go ahead , Jeff . </s>
Our fix , Margaret , is increasing taxes because we think it’s a low tax nation . </s>
The earlier fixes were reducing benefits with significant increases in taxes as well . So we have a difference . We’re not saying that Social Security will not have a shortfall . We are avoiding this inflammatory rhetoric about it’s going bust and longevity is doing it all and all that kind of thing . I have to do something for radio , which is one of those times when I want -- I need to read something twice , once with your enthusiastic and spontaneous applause at the beginning . </s>
So if you could do a round of applause , I’m going to do my line and then -- not yet . </s>
And then I’ll do the line again without your applause , so if you could give a round of applause , that would be great . Thank you . This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I’m John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We have four debaters , two teams of two , arguing out this motion : `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future.” Thank you . </s>
Now I’m going to do it again . This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I’m John Donvan of ABC News . We’re at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . Two teams , two members -- two against two , arguing out this motion : `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future.” Okay , back to questions . </s>
Thank you for that . That was great applause . </s>
Sir , right -- I’m looking right at you . And just wait for the mic to come . </s>
I think Mr. Zuckerman began to touch on this , but the debate has largely centered on fairness and solvency . But I was wondering if somebody could speak a bit more about the long-term economic impact in terms of if you spend money on these entitlement programs , that’s money that’s not going to be spent somewhere else and , for example , the Fermi Lab just had the plug pulled on it last week , and President Obama is trying desperately to get more infrastructure spending . So I guess my question is -- Well , your question is -- </s>
Or real quick , can we discuss the long-term economic impact of not having that spending . Would it be fair to say you’re asking whether the programs are going to be a drag on the economy , on growth , on productivity -- And thus imperiling Junior’s future . Okay , I’ll just put to the side arguing against . Absolutely not . </s>
In fact -- </s>
Howard Dean . </s>
In fact , it’s a huge boost . </s>
Florida , as an example , its economy is essentially built on Social Security . </s>
This is -- no , this is true . This is the multiplier effect . What these are is transfer payments . </s>
They are transfer payments to people who otherwise wouldn’t be spending money . Every dime that goes into Social Security gets spent because these folks who were depending on Social Security have to spend everything in order to survive and to live . And so , this -- it creates all kinds of multiplier affects wherever they are . </s>
That’s why people like retirees living in their state . </s>
They don’t use much in the way of services other than health care which is mostly paid for by the Fed , and they don’t have any kids in the schools and so forth and so on . So in fact , these so-called transfer entitlement programs are big boosts to the economy and not drags at all . Let’s hear the other side respond to that . Interesting point . </s>
Well , I think that is true . The point that I would make , though , is that when people are paying the Social Security taxes , it’s when they’re working . We’re trying to protect that system for the people when they retire . It is certainly true that when they retire , this being in most cases their only source of income , they’re going to spend it . And I’m just as happy to have people , when they’re working , contribute more to this system to make sure that it is viable . </s>
Okay . </s>
Down front , you’ve been very patient . If you can stand up , and the mic’s coming to you . </s>
No , no -- I’m sorry . You’re going to have to be even more patient . I meant in the third row . Sorry , sir , but if you could stand up . Thanks . </s>
Hi there . My name is -- oops . My name is Alice Silverman and I am a grandma who is very concerned about my juniors and my junior’s juniors , some of whom live in Burlington , Vermont , by the way . So my question -- </s>
And therefore they have health care . My question for the evening is how you all get to speak with your respective team members , so to speak , and continue to have them as reasonable and cooperative as the four of you seem to be tonight , so that we can really get some things done here . How can we love each other more ? </s>
I -- look , there’s only one way to do that . </s>
I’m going to take that as more of an aspirational statement than a question , because I think we take your point . Right next to you , yeah . Hillary Sisel Jordan . My question is , you seem to all agree that what 's germane to the debate is politics not working . </s>
And I 'm just wondering , this is n't going , I do n't think too far from the debate , is our politics as intransigent as the health care system ? And what do you suggest be done ? Everybody blames everything on politics . </s>
Does it -- Well , the reason I think that 's a relevant question is because , Howard , you have made the case repeatedly , and you also , Jeff , that there need to be basic changes in the way we do things . And Mort keeps coming back saying that would be great if we could do that , but he 's saying it 's politically impossible . So that 's kind of a little bit of a strike against your position if Mort is right that the things you 're talking about just ca n't be done politically . So can you take that on ? </s>
You know , the things Mort is talking -- I mean , is Mort just throwing up his hands and going to go back to Canada ? The thing that Mort is suggesting be done ca n't be done politically either as far as I can hear . If he has any solutions for this that are politically viable now , more politically viable than our side , please speak up , Mort . Here 's your chance . </s>
Well , I do think that the notion of changing fee for services , which I am totally in favor of , or trying to get a cap on medical tort liability , which I 'm totally in favor of , I ca n't imagine how that 's going to happen for a very long time . </s>
I do think we still , in the interim , can introduce some modest changes to the Social Security system which we 've been doing since the initiation of that program . And they did it , as I said , in 1983 . What it will take , to answer the question , is political leadership . And that 's what we do n't have and have n't had for years , who really -- people who really want to address this because they feel they 're going to lose votes in one place or another . </s>
And that 's the sad part if we have a system . </s>
In Canada , for example , they 're doing it very differently . Margaret Hoover . And -- and it 's really working , with a different kind of political leadership , with a different kind of politicalism . We do n't have that . </s>
Margaret . Margaret . So -- and we agree in many ways on what the problems are : Fee for service . Governor Dean agreed with us that fee for service is a problem , though we have dramatically different ideas about how to address that . </s>
And I think you 're right that our politics have become so polarized that you can not simply come to the table admitting that there are going to be principal differences and figure out how to -- how to work it out . And the political game and the bomb throwing has made touching Medicare or social security a third rail for anyone who tries to take it on . Look what 's happened to Paul Ryan who puts forth a plan that you might not like . </s>
But he puts down a plan that goes through the trouble of getting it scored by CVO . </s>
And the next thing we know , there 's a commercial of him throwing Grandma off a cliff . Howard Dean . That 's nuts . </s>
Well , actually , I thought that that was fairly accurate . No . I 'm sorry . That 's part of the problem . </s>
Trying to stifle my partisan side here . Look , I 'm by nature , optimistic . And I agree that we can discuss for a long time what 's the matter with the political leadership . </s>
I do think elections have a way of eventually fixing that problem . I think the private sector 's going to do it , and I 'll tell you why . </s>
Because of the Obama health care plan , which I was not a big supporter of , but which does have some good things in it , there is a real opportunity in the private sector . And I 'll tell you what it is . If you have a totally vertically integrated system like Kaiser , for example , or Geisinger , they can now sell their product outside an insurance agency . When they go on the exchanges , which are going to be in place in 2014 , you are now going to have people competing with insurance companies to keep prices low . </s>
The other great thing about this bill is the exchange is basically a transparent way of buying insurance . Private -- Democrats go crazy when I say this , but the truth is , small business is going to dump all their people into the exchanges . That is a great thing because now individuals are going to go into the marketplace and choose their own insurance with some government subsidy . And that is market forces at work . Okay . </s>
And an integrated system will beat an insurance company every single time . Let me go to the front row for this gentleman I passed over before . Hello . My name is David , and I believe I fit into the junior generation . And I was just really worried about a statistic that Mr. Madrick brought up . </s>
He said that when I retire , so like when I 'm 75 or whatever , when I qualify for Social Security , I will -- </s>
If Mort and -- if Mort and Margaret get their way , you probably wo n't get Social Security when you 're 75 . All right . Well , when I do get my Social Security payments , I was told that I would only get 78 percent , I believe it was , of my benefits . But when you subtract -- when you deduct basically all the expenses I would normally be paying when I 'm receiving a hundred percent of my benefits , how much would I have left of that 78 percent . I agree with that . </s>
And that 's why I think we do have to raise taxes and get up -- get it up to a hundred percent . I 'm not sure our opponents are talking about maintaining the same level of benefits . I think they are talking about reducing those benefits . But that sort of does get to the bone of my -- are you talking about maintaining the same level of benefits that we have today ? Absolutely , without a question . </s>
Nobody suggested cutting the benefits . </s>
Frankly , if there would be any benefits cut , I would cut them for the well-to-do . So I would put in an income standard for that . But on all the other benefits , absolutely not . What we 're trying to do is to make it possible for us to afford to continue to pay those benefits . And so I 'm just going to go to one issue because this is a chance for me to say , even though it 's not relevant . </s>
If Bill Clinton has a wonderful idea for how you deal with health insurance , private health insurance , where in most states one or two companies really dominate the entire health insurance med space . He said , you just put in one line into their policies , mandate it , that 85 percent of the premiums they receive go to health care benefits , and the rest of it , only the rest of it can go to promotion and profits . </s>
And he said you would have a major improvement in that . Well , fine . I 'm ready to sign onto that . Any time you -- when I 'm president , the first appointed , Canadian Jewish president , I 'm willing -- I 'm willing to sign that legislation . </s>
Just a minute . I want to ask -- you -- you 've been shaking your head dramatically -- That 's in the law . That is the law . </s>
It 's in Obama 's law . You look very , very frustrated by things you 're hearing . The 80 percent , not 85 percent . </s>
And I -- I want to see that unleashed in the form of a 30-second question . My name is Roger Karlback , and I heard Mr. Zuckerman say he 's willing to have increases in taxes , maybe doing it through the caps rather than the rates . And he 's willing to do other things . But I do n't know if the Republican national broadcasting representative is willing to raise revenue at all . </s>
So let me put it to her . Okay . Can you -- can you correct your approach to Margaret Hoover ? Yes . </s>
We -- we like to keep it pretty civil . Thank you . It seems to me that this intergenerational thing with the sponsor of the thing , his introduction was less impartial than it has been in the past . He kind of was shilling for this side . And I thought that was n't right . </s>
Okay . Not a question . We 're going to take one more . Do we have time for one more ? </s>
Yeah , right behind -- right behind our executive producer . Hi . My name is Deanna Oliver , I 'm a student at NYU . I have a question for you , Governor Dean . </s>
In the introduction of your opening statement , you claimed that there is n't in fact a Social Security trust fund problem . However , there 's a problem with political collaboration and our economical stance right now . </s>
So if we are to lack progress in either of those areas which both sides have agreed to , and private sectors do n't act on the opportunity which you claimed in your last response , does that mean that the future of the millennials will in fact be at risk ? I do n't think so . And I 'll tell you why . Howard Dean . I think the millennials are -- people have often asked should we have term limits in the United States Senate . </s>
I said no , but we should n't allow anybody over 50 to serve in the United States Senate . </s>
That would solve the problem . You guys are -- you 've elected your first president . And now you 're going to eventually take the reins of power . </s>
You are not a confrontational generation . You focus -- there 's much less ideological bandwidth among your generation than there is in mine . And I actually think you are going to get to some solutions , which as soon as us older -- the political class is always the last to get it . And as soon as these guys pass onto someplace else with their deserved reward , you guys are going to be running the Senate , and you guys are actually going to sit down across what minimal ideological lines you have and get something done . So this is going to get fixed . </s>
I 'd just like to see our generation own up to it and fix it and stop yapping at each other so we 'll not have to leave it up to you . And Margaret Hoover . </s>
I would just say , I -- on the one hand , I completely agree with Governor Dean . On the other hand , you 're the one who just said , Paul Ryan pushed Grandma over the cliff . He did . So you resembled -- but you 're resembling this partisanship that is polarizing the debate and not letting us get to the solution the millennials are trying to get to . </s>
And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . And here 's where we are . We 're about to hear closing statements from each debater in turn . The closing statements will be two minutes each . And remember how you voted before the debate because immediately afterwards , you will vote again . </s>
So this is their last chance to change your mind . So onto round three , closing statements . And the first to speak against our motion , which is `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future , '' Jeff Madrick , author of `` The Age of Greed : The Triumph of Finance and the Decline of America from 1970 to the Present . '' Grandma 's benefits do not imperil Junior 's future . The main reason is we have so much room to raise taxes without impeding economic growth that we can handle the so- called -- not the so-called -- the Social Security debt -- what I meant was the so-called Social Security insolvency -- relatively easily . </s>
Medicare is not a problem for 10 or 12 more years , and we do as Governor Dean and I think , Mort Zuckerman and maybe Margaret agree , we have to reform that system . </s>
I am obliged to say something about Paul Ryan 's plan , just because he had it scored by CBO and won some plaudits in the media does not mean it was not an extremist plan . It meant triage . </s>
It meant literally triage for Medicare recipients down the road . It meant they would n't get covered . Keep one fact in mind because in the end I think what 's generating our opposition 's ire is that we have big deficits in America . </s>
If we reversed the Bush tax cuts , not only on the top 250 but for everybody , we would solve the deficit problem for the next 10 years . The deficit , the debt in America would not rise above approximately 70 percent of GDP , these are CBO numbers , not my numbers . We would be in what 's called primary surplus so you see how much latitude we have to take care of these problems without jeopardizing the economic growth . And it 's economic growth that the young need because that 's what creates jobs for the young , and we -- </s>
Thank you , Jeff Madrick . -- fouled that up badly so far . Thank you , your time is up . </s>
Jeff Madrick . Our motion is `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future , '' and here to summarize his position for the motion , Mort Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report . Well , just about every serious review of the benefits in broad term of entitlement programs in part because of the problems that the governor mentions which is the problems in our health care system which are much more intractable than dealing with the entitlement programs ' financial problems . Virtually everybody says `` We 've got to do somebody about that . </s>
Now , the question is , if you had to make a pragmatic judgment as to what you could do about it , I have to say to you that some of the proposals that are put forth by the other side are about as likely as -- well , you name it , as Governor Dean becoming president . No , I -- believe me , I 've been a Democrat all my life . I would have supported him , had he got the nomination , but he did not get the nomination , and at this stage of the game he 's not in that political mood . But I would just say to you that these are very , very serious , serious times for us . </s>
This country is on the verge of losing a great deal of the economic energy that it has had , in part because of the failures of our political system . But we have to deal at least with those programs it seems to me that protect the elderly . And this is something I 'm totally in favor of . I opposed the Bush tax cuts when they came about . I supported reinstating the tax levels when other democratic presidents reintroduced some of the Bush tax cuts . </s>
I did n't support that . But whatever it is , we 've got to do something about these programs or else in fact the burdens that they are going to imply in terms of the deficit that this country is going to have to undertake in order to deal with these programs , is going to do immense damage to the very future of the people that we 're talking about . We call him Junior but I 'll tell you what , whoever they are , they , their cohorts , their younger siblings , their older siblings , they 're all going to pay the price and it 's going to be a huge price in terms of what their future is . </s>
So my view is take the most , in a sense , the simplest way to solve it , even though there are other solutions , I do n't disagree with that , that 's much more difficult to do . I hope we can reform the medical system . </s>
We have to do that . Thank you . Mort Zuckerman . Your time 's up . Thank you . </s>
Our motion is `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future . '' And here to summarize his position against this motion , Howard Dean , former chairman of the Democratic National Committee and longest serving governor of Vermont . Well , first of all , let me say we 're going to take this fight to North Carolina , and then we 're going to Michigan , and then we 're going to South Carolina -- -- and then we 're going to -- oh , pardon me , excuse me . First of all , I’m heartened by the agreement among us . We’ve really put up a lot of the positions that I think the four of us could sit down for four and a half hours , I bet we could solve all these problems as long as we didn’t have any problems like the Senate and the presidency and the House to interfere with us , which actually means that we agree on the substance that this is a solvable problem . </s>
And what is standing in the way of the problem ? </s>
Is it Grandma’s benefits or is it a political problem ? The framing of the opposition who doesn’t like any kind of government is that this is a benefit problem . </s>
This is not a benefit problem . This is a governmental failure problem and an economic failure problem . So we have a broad agreement and some disagreement about how we can fix these problems . But we don’t have to go through those because there’s so much agreement here . </s>
The question is how are we going to fix this . Is Mort right when he says , “Well , we can’t do this tomorrow” ? We can’t do it if we rely on politicians to do it tomorrow , but the hallmark of this millennial generation is to cast aside the political process and just do it , do it locally , do it in the private sector , do it any way you can . So I conclude that Grandma’s benefits do not endanger Junior’s future . What endangers Junior’s future is a failure of our political system to work properly , a failure of people at the top of both the economic and government field to take full responsibility for a great country . </s>
I have no doubt that the millennial generation will restore that greatness , but in the meantime , I think it is very important for us not to scapegoat particular groups , whether its seniors or immigrants or Muslims or gays , whoever it is . </s>
We ought to put an end to scapegoating politics and focus on the real problem , which is how we treat each other and not Grandma’s benefits . Thank you , Howard Dean . Our motion is `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future.” And here to summarize her position in support of the motion , Margaret Hoover , author of “American Individualism : How a New Generation of Conservatives Can Save the Republican Party.” So throughout our country’s history , Americans have found the courage to do right by our children’s future . </s>
Deep down , every American knows that we face a moment of truth again . We can not play games or put off hard choices any longer . </s>
Without regard to party , we have a patriotic duty to keep the promise of America , to give our children and grandchildren a better life . Our challenge is clear and inescapable . America can not be great if we go broke . </s>
These are not my words , but the words from the preamble of President Obama’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform . This is not inflammatory language from the far right . This was a bipartisan commission by Democrat Erskine Bowles , Republican Alan Simpson , appointed by Democratic President Obama . </s>
There is broad consensus that we are on a course of fiscal disaster . </s>
Again , not inflammatory language but language that is used broadly by Democrats and Republicans alike , embodied by this panel , Mort as a Democrat and myself as a Republican . I think Governor Dean has done fancy footwork by trying to make this about politicians and not about what the motion is about , which is that Grandma’s benefits , which we all agree -- everyone on this panel agrees -- need to be fixed . </s>
And everybody has their own solutions for fixing it . That notion that they all need to be fixed is -- it confirms the motion that there is a problem with the system , that Junior’s benefits are imperiled . </s>
So I would just say for everyone in the audience who is in their 30s or younger , we should feel real urgency to address these problems and take on these reforms because it’s about our economic future and our economic prosperity . So please vote with us . Thank you , Margaret Hoover . </s>
And that concludes our closing statements . And now it’s time to find out which side you , our live audience here at the Skirball Center , feel argued best . Our motion is `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future.” If you go to those keypads at your seat , it’s your chance to vote now . If you agree with the motion , `` Grandma 's benefits imperil -- do imperil Junior 's future , ” if you feel that was the better argued side , press number one , this side . </s>
If you feel the other side , the side arguing against the motion , argued better , push number two . And if you remain or became undecided , push number three . And we will lock the votes in . </s>
And I’ll have the results actually in about 1 minute and 18 seconds from now . They come very quickly . So that concludes the argumentation portion of the evening . And because I feel that all of these sides came and argued with each other so respectfully , finding common ground even as they disagreed , I think they did a terrific job . And I just want to congratulate them all for doing that . </s>
I want to acknowledge that Slate magazine is our media partner , and this debate was being streamed live on Slate . And to everybody out in Slate land , thank you very much for watching and for participating in this . </s>
And I also want to thank the many people who got up and asked questions because I know that I set a tough standard , and it takes some guts to get up and do that . The questions actually were pretty good tonight and on topic . So congratulations to everybody who asked questions . So as you know , we do a series every fall and every winter and spring . And this year we 're trying something new . </s>
Normally we will set up these debates and the panels well in advance . But we left one blank spot deliberately this year , October 25th , almost to the last minute to put together a debate on a topic that was very , very much in the news and relevant . And we have chosen the topic . And it 's going to be this : Congress should approve Obama 's jobs plan . </s>
Arguing for the motion we have Cecilia Rouse . She is a labor economist who served on the president 's Council of Economic Advisors , and her partner supporting the motion for the jobs plan is Mark Zandy , Moody 's analytics chief economist who predicts , actually , that the president 's plan will add two percentage points to GDP growth and will add 1.9 million jobs . </s>
Arguing against the plan , Dan Mitchell . He is an advocate of a flat tax and a senior fellow at the Cato Institute . And Richard Epstein , he 's a law professor here at NYU . And he describes the president 's plan as , `` a mishmash of taxes , subsidies and regulations . '' And he also describes it as , `` A turgid 155-page bill . '' </s>
So that 's going to be here and have some NYU influence . And we hope that you 'll all take part , come down for that debate on October 25th . If you happen to be in Chicago on October 12th , we 're also putting on a debate , the first time we 're going to Chicago for the Chicago Ideas Week Festival . Peter Thiel , the controversial cofounder of PayPal who has been paying students $ 100,000 to drop out of college on the theory that they are wasting their time in college when they could be out building businesses as entrepreneurs . He 's going to be headlining the debate in which the motion language actually is `` Too many kids go to college . '' </s>
So everybody get on a plane to Chicago for next week . You have a full listing of this fall 's debates in tonight 's program and on our website . And tickets are also available for purchase . All of our debates , as we said before , can be heard on NPR stations across the nation , including WNYC here in New York , and also it can be watched on WNET 's channel 13 , WLIW and NJTV . And you can also follow Intelligence Squared on Twitter and make sure to become a fan on Facebook . </s>
And you will receive a discount on future debates . Okay . </s>
You have heard all of the arguments . </s>
You have been asked to vote twice . The motion we were listening to : `` Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's futures . '' We 've asked you to vote twice , once before the debate on where you stood and again afterwards to tell us which side you feel argued best , presented the better arguments . And so here now are the final results of the two votes . Before the debate , 40 percent were for the motion , 24 percent were against , and 36 percent undecided . </s>
After the debate , 38 percent are for the motion , that 's down two percent . </s>
56 percent were against . That is up 32 percent . And 6 percent are undecided . </s>
That 's down 30 percent . The side arguing against the motion that Grandma 's benefits imperil Junior 's future carries the day . Our congratulations to them . And thank you for me , John Donvan . </s>
We 'll see you next time . My name is John Donvan , and we will formally begin the debate in a couple of minutes but first I wanted to explain a couple of things , most particularly about your role as the audience , if you have been here before you know this but if this is the first time , I wan na point out that as audience members you are actually part of the debate in a few different ways . Most importantly you are the judges of the winners of the debate , we ask you to vote twice , both before the debate and again at the end , to share your— whether or not you agree with the motion , whether you’re against the motion or whether you are undecided . And tonight we’re doing something a little bit more nuanced , we are going to ask you to vote in such a way that we can tell—we can tally votes from men , and votes from women , at every step of the way . Ah ! </s>
The way that we’ll vote , there’s a keypad next to your seat , attached to your seat…and if you are female , the numbers that concern you are 1 , 2 , and 3…1 means that you are for , 1 means that you are female and you are for the resolution , 2 means that you are against the resolution , and 3 means that you’re undecided . If you are male , you are concerned with the numbers 4 , 5 , 6 . 4 means that you’re for the resolution , 5 means that you’re against and 6 means that you’re undecided , and we’ll vote…shortly after the debate officially begins . </s>
Takes about 30 seconds to vote and I’ll give everybody a chance . …A couple more things very briefly , we are being broadcast on National Public Radio as all of these debates are , now on more than 185 stations across the nation . We are going to have two endings tonight , one of them will be , the ending that will be broadcast on radio in which we will simply , report at the end of the debate…the accumulated results without breaking them down by sex . After that we’ll have our second ending which is just for you , in which we’ll share what the results were by sex , how men voted , and by how women voted . I’d like to begin by introducing the chairman of Intelligence Squared US , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Well thank you all very much for joining us this evening . Tonight’s resolution is the same language that was used in an IQ Squared debate in London . </s>
And that was a very , very lively debate and we thought it’d be fun to , or interesting to repeat it here . My role typically in these evenings is to sort of frame the debate , to summarize the arguments that we might expect to hear on both sides . </s>
But as I thought about the language of today’s resolution , it seemed to me that it was not quite the crisp , clear proposition that we usually try to put forth . And it might be more useful for me to reflect a little bit on the actual words of the , of the resolution . The first the word “wrong.” </s>
Well , it’s certainly wrong to pay for sex if you wan na keep your job as the governor of New York . </s>
And…you know—I predict a laugh . But wrong in that sense is wrong as a matter of public morality . And that’s one way of discussing right and wrong . Another way of discussing it is in terms of , just private individual conduct , is this gon na make you feel like you’ve lived a well-lived life if you abide by these principles or don’t abide by these principles . </s>
And the third kind of possible definition of wrong , is it should be illegal , or it should be legal . So those are three different meanings of “wrong , ” and might lead to three very different takes on tonight’s , resolution . The language “to pay” is quite deliberate , because it’s focusing on the economically advantaged party , and that was a very conscious choice , both in London and by ourselves . And finally the notion of paying for sex , can encompass such an incredibly broad range of ideas , — from patrons of child prostitutes in Thai brothels , to rich Wall Streeters who support their girlfriends in graduate school . So there’s such a huge range of meanings here , in the language of , of the resolution , and we have such an able group of panelists . </s>
But I think sorting this out and keeping these proceedings orderly , is a difficult task tonight and it falls to the very able John Donvan who’ll take the evening from here . Thank you , and may I invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to another Intelligence Squared US debate , I’m John Donvan of ABC News “Nightline , ” and I will be moderating the debaters that you see sharing the stage here with me at the Caspary Auditorium at the Rockefeller University in New York City . </s>
Six debaters , two tables , three against three , will be debating this motion , “It is wrong to pay for sex.” Now this is not a seminar or a penal discussion , this is a competition , winners and loser , it is a contest of ideas and logic and quick-wittedness and perhaps charm , but most of all , persuasion , because by the time this debate concludes , you the audience will have voted twice , both before the debate and once again at the end , your vote is to tell us whether you side with or against the teams on this stage and their arguments , and the team which has changed the most minds over the course of the debate , will be declared the winner . So now we’re gon na bring up the house lights , and we are going to hold our first vote and I will reemphasize for those who might have arrived late , tonight , we are asking men and women to vote using separate keys . Keys 1 , 2 , and 3 are for women , 4 , 5 , and 6 are for men . If you are female vote 1 if you are with the proposition , 2 if you vote against , and 3 if you are undecided , if you are male , vote 4 if you are for the proposition , 5 if you are against , and 6 if you are undecided . </s>
If you have made a mistake , and you regret…your key punch…just correct it , and we will lock in your last vote . And I’m seeing the faces that everybody gets this and we’re good , does anybody need more time ? Okay , so we’re gon na lock in the vote . </s>
And proceed with the debate . </s>
And now Round 1 , arguing for the motion , Wendy Shalit , a writer , who has… made something of a career of writing about the topic of modesty , and seems to come up with an excellent gift for titles . </s>
Her first piece for Commentary when she was a college student at Williams College criticizing the co-ed bathroom policy was , “A Ladies’ Room of One’s Own.” </s>
And your all but last book is titled , Girl— Girls— The Good Girl Revolution . Oh , I was thinking of Girls Gone Mild . Yes , that , that’s the hardcover— </s>
Which—which was its previous title and it’s also brilliant . Yes . Wendy Shalit , ladies and gentlemen— We changed it ‘cause there was some confusion . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Ladies and gentleman , thank you so much for joining us tonight to consider this most important topic . </s>
Before delving in I still have in my mind a song I heard on the way to the airport on the radio , which went like this . “I’m not a saint but I’m not a sinner , everything’s cool as long as I’m getting thinner.” Which , I think , expresses a profound truth , actually . It’s a serious question . In a society in which the self is the body , to some degree , as long as we’re getting thinner , do we even believe that there is such a thing as a sexual right , and a sexual wrong . </s>
Nobody wants to judge . Adultery is now a lifestyle choice . A 22-year-old woman from San Diego , is now auctioning off her virginity to the highest bidder . Right ? </s>
And we’re not supposed to judge . And yet I would submit that we do judge , all the time . When I was living here in Manhattan some 10 years ago , I’ll never forget the time when I was innocently buying my Metro pass , and sipping my coffee , and a man came up from behind me and barked at me and he said , you know , you shouldn’t drink those frappaccinos , they’re very fattening . </s>
And I was shocked that a perfect stranger would presume to judge my beverage choices that way . But then I realized that everybody has a notion of right and wrong and to this man frappaccinos were just wrong . My worthy opponent , Sydney Barrows , writes in her memoir , Mayflower Madame , that a DNS in the call girl business stood for “Do not send.” Men who were obnoxious or who had really gross apartments , she wouldn’t send her girls to such men . </s>
And she also writes , “Whenever I read about a business who had done something I didn’t approve of , such as a building an ugly high- rise in a residential neighborhood , I added his name to the list , just in case he ever called us.” Which I thought was really funny , also . To some people , building an ugly high-rise is morally wrong . It’s an offense against the aesthetic order . Ladies and gentlemen , I would submit to you that paying for sex is at least as wrong as building an ugly high- rise . </s>
Perhaps more so . Why , because we’re using— we’re talking about using a human being as a means to your ends . Today people want to believe that paying for sex is just like paying for a hamburger . But a sexual transaction is different , because it teaches on the deepest , most personal aspects of ourselves . The proof that sex is different , in my opinion , is our response to the terrible crime of rape . </s>
If paying for sex were as morally neutral as paying for a hamburger , well then , rape is akin to just forcing someone to eat a hamburger . Right ? But of course it is not . It is a horrible crime , that is serious , precisely because sexuality touches on the deepest , most personal aspect of our humanity . And to take something so intimate , and to turn it into a commodity , has far- reaching , devastating effects , for men , women and children . </s>
Everyone agrees that after the Netherlands adopted legalization that this has added fuel to the gangs who trafficked in underage girls , and that the abuse in child prostitution exploded rather than was reduced . It’s time to ask why . Well , firstly what we value in women , eventually trickles down to girls . For example today we place a lot of value on hotness in women , have you noticed this ? </s>
And so , now in , for example in the Bratts Babies video , which is watched by three- and four-year-old girls by the way , you can hear cartoon babies singing songs about “being hotter than hot , show what you’ve got , ready or not.” For three- year-olds . What we value in women inevitably trickles down to girls . Secondly prostitution , like all industries , is demand-led . Someone could go to great trouble manufacturing coats made from cockroaches , but since nobody wants cockroach coats , the supplier would soon find that there’s no market , no demand , and no money in it , except may Ozzy Osbourne would buy it . </s>
But because prostitution is demand-led , it’s the paying for sex that’s a problem . That’s what creates the demand , and given that the average age of entry into prostitution is 13 or 14 years old , I think this presents a huge moral problem . </s>
I receive a ton of emails from girls who are 14 , 15 , leave home , because they’ve been abused , only to try to escape prostitution . Unfortunately at the time , one writes to me , “It was all I felt I had to offer the world , my body . As you can no doubt guess , I was molested by my father for many years when I was a child . </s>
It’s why my mother let me leave . So in a sense I was raised to believe my body had only one use , and I was worth only this one thing.” We can talk later about why the molestation rates for prostitutes are so high , why the suicide rates are so high . </s>
But , right now I wan na focus on the fact that the problem is that nobody knows if these girls are 14 or 18 . And , we think about the sheer number of sex slaves in captivity in the US , we’re talking about , anything from 30,000 to 50,000 . </s>
It’s staggering , and it’s sickening . We’re talking about girls that are having sex with 20 to 30 men per day , one girl told the New York Times about her cell of traffickers , her captors offered three age ranges of sex partners , toddler to age four , age five to 12 , and teens as well as the damage group…where they could do anything that they wanted . When one of the Mexican child-trafficking rings was busted in a house in Plainfield , New Jersey , uh , another Mexican ring was recently busted -- but this one was a few years ago—the neighbors , in retrospect thought about all the cars that came , and all of the girls that… left that house to buy candy , but they always said no one knew what was going on . I’m always struck that the neighbors always say this , well somebody knew what was going on because someone was paying for the sex . To those who are against trafficking , but they insist that some women have nothing else to sell but their bodies , I say that they suffer from a real lack of imagination . </s>
About the power of the human spirit and about the strength of women in particular and if you keep up with the Harvard Business Review , you may have noticed , that they’re now talking about micro-loans to poor women and only lending them , only having these loans to poor women . Right ? Because they notice that the poorest of women reinvest in the household and the men do not . So…we have to believe in the women first , it takes a risk to give them that loan . </s>
If instead we demand their bodies instead of appealing to their intelligence , it’s this philosophy of this is all she can do , and the not too subtle misogyny behind it , that feeds the demand and expectations that cause the problem . Wendy Shalit , your time is up . Thank you— </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you . And again for newcomers , in the opening round each speaker has even minutes uninterrupted to speak so Wendy had just reached the seven-minute point . Up first to speak against the motion that it’s wrong to pay to sex , Lionel Tiger , the Charles Darwin Professor of Anthropology at Rutgers University , the anthropologist who gave us the term “male bonding.” </s>
He has been arguing more recently that it is men who get the short end in society . Given , Lionel , your writing about men’s issues I’ve always wondered…Tiger , is that something you adopted late in life or were you born a Tiger . </s>
It’s appropriate for that branch of show business known as the academic profession . It works quite well . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Lionel Tiger . Thank you very much , thank you , Wendy , for starting this off in a serious and interesting manner . </s>
I have to say , I’m quite confounded by this , because it’s quite clearly wrong to pay for wrong sex . There is no one in this room I daresay , who will shed a tear for anyone who is jailed for trafficking in toddlers . That I think is an absurdity , to start a discussion about the very serious , momentous issue of human sexuality . </s>
So , we’re all opposed to coercive , we’re all opposed unequivocally , I’m sure , to the kind of stories we hear about the Russian Mafia trafficking women whose passports are stolen from them and then they have to work off their fare and so on . </s>
These are all obvious . They’re not debatable . </s>
I won’t debate them , therefore . But what we have with respect to , Wendy just heard is , a perfect contemporary exposition of the early 20th century sociological fallacy , which is you look for a deviant phenomenon , and attribute to that the nature of the normal . So by talking about rape , talking about toddlers being abused sexually , this then frames the entire discussion of what you guys and gals may decide to do in your own homes with your own lust , with your own love , and that is simply methodologically wrong . </s>
Furthermore , it begins from a premise that legal distinctions constitute the vocabulary of life’s distinctions . And again , this is simply methodologically improper . So for example in American sociology many early sociologists would look at prison behavior and say ah-ha , this is what life is really like . It’s not . </s>
It’s a prison . It’s what it is because of what it is . </s>
It’s not reflective . </s>
And furthermore , I get here , and forgive me for maybe being , counter-casting here , but I think this entire argument somehow is profoundly disrespectful to females . If you want to see people paying for sex , I suggest you go to the ground floor of Bloomingdale’s . The place is full of women paying for garments , colors , clasps , various instruments of torture— lust , you name it , but they’re paying for their own sense of themselves as sexual creatures , and they’re not on that floor because they don’t like sex and they don’t like what it means . And furthermore , what it tells us about is , that there’s an inner economy to sex , that doesn’t have to do with raping toddlers , with raping girls who are abused by their fathers , please . </s>
If you’re raped by your father you’ve got a problem independently of the one we’re discussing . </s>
That’s just how it is . There was a remarkable story in the Times , last couple of weeks ago , about a website called SeekingArrangement.com . In this website , men and women can sign up to be -- essentially a rich Wall Street executive , thank you , Mr. Rosenkranz for the metaphor—to be set up and go through graduate school . </s>
Now in this system , which is not explicitly about sex , it’s about a wide variety of things , the ratio of women applying to men , is 10 to one . Free choice . 10 to one . </s>
These are probably women you know , I know , who knows . </s>
But the fact is that—and this is just one anecdote and it’s not typical of everything , please don’t overextend it , but the fact is that women have a deal with men which requires that they have some relationship with men , especially if they’re inclined to reproduce which still 80 percent of women in North America . And women know that they will have five to eight years when they’re out of the labor force , and , it helps to have a guy around the place . And so… The fact is that if we’re looking just now , Mr. Donvan mentioned the current male- female balance . In this current recession or depression or whatever it’s called , 82 percent of the jobs lost are male jobs . That means that , women will not have a guy—if they want one…this is free choice , please , I’m not an obligatory heterosexual mastermind here but if women want a mate , then they’re not going to have…one of those men that has lost a job . </s>
It’s a complicated argument but it’s a long story , I’m an anthropologist , we’re interested in what people around the world do , 90—over 90 percent of human marriages are arranged . They’re determined by families in terms of the larger interests of the two clans , they usually involve a bride price or a dowry , or something like that in which the male usually commits himself to sustaining the female , we don’t do it with cattle , we do it with some exotic unit called the diamond ring . An engagement ring is the world’s stupidest object , the moment you take it out of the store , it’s lost 80 percent of its value , if in fact it has any value at all , just ask DeBeers , there’s—they’re crying . But , the guy has to pay two months’ after-tax income for this diamond ring , to give to the gal to assure her that he’s going to be okay . </s>
Now , if he’s not , she keeps the ring . </s>
But the point is that this is a— This is a classic anthropological phenomenon , my time is quickly run out , I had no idea that… It’s up— </s>
—it would— I— Lionel , Lionel Tiger , ladies and gentlemen , whose time is up . Of all of our debaters tonight , our next speaker who will be arguing for the motion that it’s wrong to pay for sex has truly brought the arsenal of the researcher to this topic . Melissa Farley is a clinical and research psychologist with Prostitution Research and Education which is a non-profit that she founded . </s>
She is an Associate Scholar with the Center for World Indigenous Studies , her position on prostitution has been described as abolitionist and I’m assuming , Melissa , that our familiarity with that word and the topic of slavery is no coincidence for you . It is not . Ladies and gentlemen , Melissa Farley . Thank you . Thanks . </s>
Some words hide the truth . Just as torture is named , “enhanced interrogation , ” and the logging of old-growth forests is called the Healthy Forest Initiative , so also prostitution is named a choice , a job , work , a victimless crime , and on Craigslist it’s called “a wide range of personal meeting and relationship opportunities.” These pimp-messaged slogans are good for business but there’s not much truth to them . What’s wrong with prostitution is the renting out of a woman’s mouth , vagina , or anus , and what it does to her , psychologically . What’s wrong with prostitution , and what’s wrong with buying sex , are the same things that are wrong with other forms of violence against women , incest , rape , and battery . </s>
I’ve been researching prostitution for 15 years , we’ve interviewed 900 women , men , and transgendered people in prostitution , in nine countries on five continents . </s>
And over the course of that time we’ve also interviewed 500 johns . Prostitution is not a choice because the precise conditions that make a choice are absent . </s>
For example , equality with buyers , and physical safety , and real alternatives . If you imagine a pyramid , remember that only about the top 5 percent of all women in prostitution are at the top of that pyramid . These are people that are privileged by race and class . The other 95 percent don’t have those kinds of privilege or alternatives for escape . Let me give you some examples of the sex inequality , the race-ethnic inequality , and the economic inequality in prostitution that are often invisible . </s>
A woman in Lusaka , who knew that five blow jobs would get her a sack of mealy meal to feed her kids . That’s not a choice . A woman in India who worked in an office where she concluded that she might as well be paid for the sexual harassment that was expected of her anyway , in her job . That’s not a choice . The teen in California who said that in her neighborhood , boys grew up to be dealers and pimps and girls to be ‘hos . </s>
She was the third generation of prostituted women in her family . And prostitution more severely harms people who are indigenous or ethnically marginalized because of their lack of alternatives . That’s not a choice . </s>
Or the young woman sold by her parents in a brothel in Nevada . </s>
She took six different psychiatric drugs to make it through the day , selling sex , that’s not a choice , or Ashley Dupre , who was bought by Governor Spitzer . Dupre ran away from what she called an abusive home at 17 , she’d been homeless , she had a drug problem , a convicted New York pimp bragged that he turned her out . And at 17 pornography was made of her by a man who had a prostitution conviction . </s>
The Emperors Club , where Spitzer bought her , was run by pimps who charged a lot because they said it was high-class call girls . But it was the same as any other pimps , they took their 50 percent off the top . </s>
Like a majority of johns , Spitzer most likely enticed , coerced or persuaded her with money to put her life on the line by not using a condom . </s>
That’s not a freely made choice . Women in prostitution face a statistical likelihood of weekly rape . A Canadian woman in prostitution said , what’s rape for others is normal for us . </s>
A woman at a legal brothel in Nevada said , it’s like you sign a contract to be raped . And in Chicago , the same frequency of rape was reported by women in both escort and street prostitution . Women in prostitution are seen as body parts or fake girlfriends and their feelings don’t matter , and they’re not seen as human which is perhaps why they’re murdered at a higher rate than any other group of women ever studied . The emotional consequences of prostitution are the same in widely varying cultures . </s>
Whether it’s high-class or low-class . Whether it’s legal or illegal , whether it’s in a brothel , strip club , massage parlor , or the street . Symptoms of emotional distress in all forms of prostitution , are off the charts . </s>
Depression , suicidality , post- traumatic stress disorder , substance abuse , dissociation… Two thirds of the women we interviewed , and all of the people we interviewed in prostitution , two thirds of them had PTSD at the same level of the most emotionally traumatized groups ever studied by psychologists . That would be combat vets , women who had just been raped , women seeking shelter from batterers , and also state-sponsored torture survivors . What’s wrong with sex is what johns themselves tell us about it . For example , if you look at it , it’s paid rape . She has to do what you want . </s>
I use them like I might use any other amenity , a restaurant , or a public convenience . </s>
It’s like renting an organ for ten minutes . In research interviews with johns , we found that their abuse of women extended to women who had not been prostituted yet . The johns that bought the most women in prostitution were the most likely to commit sexually coercive acts with non-prostituting women . </s>
When women are turned into objects that men masturbate into , it causes immense psychological harm to the person acting as a receptacle . </s>
Please don’t be fooled by people who tell buying sex is just another job . It’s wrong to set aside a special class of women , those who are the most vulnerable among us , for men’s sexual use . What’s wrong with paying for sex is it’s the business of sexual exploitation . Thanks . We are halfway through our opening round . </s>
I 'm John Donvan , of ABC News “Nightline , ” your moderator . </s>
We have heard from three debaters arguing this motion , “It’s wrong to pay for sex.” Our next debater will rise now to argue against that motion . I would like to introduce Tyler Cowen , who is a professor of economics at George Mason University , and director of the Mercatus Center , a think tank that uses economic tools to solve real world policy issues . And Tyler , we heard Wendy Shalit talk about the hamburger defense , that this is not about buying hamburgers , that it’s different . </s>
I 'm assuming as an economist you 're going to step back a little bit from that argument . </s>
I introduce you once again to the audience , Tyler Cowen . This is a very serious matter , and to take it seriously , I propose we start by looking at human diversity . Consider an example , you 're a nineteen year old American soldier , and you’ve been drafted to fight the Nazis in France , and you have , to put it bluntly , never done it before . And before the event of a big battle , you go and you buy sex from a Frenchwoman who maybe needs the money to feed her kids . </s>
Or maybe you 're a young man and you have sexual problems , and you hire a sexual surrogate to help you with those problems , and you go on to have a loving and successful marriage . </s>
Or maybe you 're a handicap person who , for whatever reasons finds that a better way to achieve sexual ends is to pay for sex . These are all examples of the diversity of the human condition . </s>
What the other side is neglecting is this diversity , a diversity of individuals , a diversity of situations , a diversity of cultures . If you look at the broad sweep , the history of mankind , there’s a big , long book by Nils Ringdahl on the history of prostitution . He looks at Medieval India , he looks at the Tang Dynasty , he looks at Renaissance courtesans , and what you find is a wide variance of outcomes . You find a lot of cases where things go fine , and you find a lot of cases where things don’t go fine . I propose what we have here is a human activity which very frequently is badly regulated , and when it is badly regulated , you will see massive amounts of abuse , unfairness , exploitation . </s>
And I recognize the other side in pointing out these abuses . But the problem is that it is a badly regulated activity . There are many , many cases , three of which I’ve outlined , where consenting adults meet , they meet voluntarily , both of them are better off , and buying of the sex is not wrong . </s>
All of the abuses listed by the other side you can find in another institution called marriage . If you go around the world and go to poorer cultures and ask within marriage how often is there rape , how often is there abuse , exploitation , unequal terms all the way down the line , women who are too young to be married , you see this happen all the time . But to go back to our resolution , the correct answer is not to condemn marriage , to say that marriage is wrong . </s>
In a way you can think of prostitution as a bit like , dare I say , banking . </s>
As we know here in New York , banking is very frequently badly regulated . And you find in many countries , believe it or not right here in Manhattan , you find examples of abuses , fraud , exploitation in banking . But again , the correct attitude or answer is not to say that all banking is wrong . There’s simply a category error being made by the other side in this debate . And again , think back to your core intuitions , there are many , many cases , millions , billions of cases in human history where informed , consenting adults have gotten together and someone has bought sex from another person . </s>
And again , I am submitting that these cases are not wrong . </s>
Go take a look at New Zealand , where prostitution is legal . It has been legal since 2003 . </s>
The other side did n't mention New Zealand at all . </s>
There’s a big long report written by the New Zealand government about how this experiment has gone . Uh , there’s a lot of evidence that it’s actually gone pretty well . A survey of the prostitutes revealed that seventy-three percent of them do it to pay household expenses , twenty-four percent of them are doing it to pay for education , thirty-eight percent are doing it to help out their children , or support an older family member , and the rates of abuse , coercion , and rape , the rate of rape is extremely low . It seems to be lower in prostitution than in a lot of other settings . But again , these are not the examples you 're hearing . </s>
The point , again , that I 'm stressing is this diversity , that when you have consenting adults there are , again , many cases where it’s simply possible that it is a okay thing to do . There are many other sectors of the economy that we can look at . If you ask the Bureau of Labor Statistics , what is the most dangerous job in the United States , at least according to the bureau , it’s being a fisherman and going out on a fishing boat . </s>
It’s an extremely hazardous occupation . There’s a lot of loss of life , loss of limb , people being crippled , unfair conditions , illegal immigrants who work under conditions that are not right . And again , these are real problems . </s>
But to think of it in terms of morality , we ask , what is the moral issue here ? The moral issue is when you have unsafe fishing boats , or when fishing is not regulated properly , or when we as society don’t think about fishing and industrial safety in all the right ways . </s>
No one thinks to say fishing is wrong , buying fish is wrong , fishing boats are wrong . Again , it is simply this category error . I would even submit that if we take the point of view suggested by the opposition , the more we try to blackball , ban , condemn an activity that we all know has existed in every society , it always pops up , there is always a black market , there are many different ways of trading sex . It is not going away . If there’s one thing that we all should realize in this room , is that the buying of sex is not going away . </s>
What we want is that it happen in a better way rather than a worse way . We need to have a constructive attitude . I do not hear that constructive attitude from the other side . What I hear is an attitude that will put this practice under a greater veil of secrecy , it will make it harder for the people who are selling to go to the law when they have problems , it will make it more of a social disgrace , and it will worsen the problems with the working conditions rather than improve it . </s>
I’d also note , just as an aside , just how culturally-bound and institution specific the complaints are . For instance , in Melissa Farley’s presentation , it’s always man and woman , man buying from woman . </s>
There’s no talk of gay prostitution , there’s not much talk of the broader sweep of human history , of practices of dowries , of the numerous tribes in human history who have taken very different attitudes than that which we hold . </s>
In fact , if you polled the majority of human beings over time , the most likely answer you 're going to hear is that the people who are doing something wrong are the men who are trying to get sex without paying for it simply by seducing the woman . Anyway , thank you all . Tyler Cowen , with a very good sense of the clock . </s>
Our next speaker is speaking for the motion that “It is wrong to pay for sex , ” it’s interesting in the context of a debate , is actually somebody who has changed the terms of debate in this country in a way that has changed all of our lives , Catharine MacKinnon , a professor of law at the University of Michigan , and also Harvard , pioneered the legal claim for sexual harassment as sex discrimination . Catharine also has been arguing on behalf of women raped in Bosnia , making the argument that rape was a form of genocide . </s>
And Catharine , the result of that trial ? You won . CATHARINE MacKINNON We won seven hundred and forty-five million dollars in the southern district of New York before a jury like you . </s>
Ladies and gentleman , Catharine MacKinnon . CATHARINE MacKINNON What I know about prostitution I know from the prostituted women that I work for , representing them because they asked me to . We have found the sanctimoniousness and the superiority of the moral position against prostituted people , that is that they are bad , to be insulting and insufferable . </s>
And we have also found the rescue impulse to be demeaning and typically ineffective . But , no one opposes the normal business of prostitution for money , that is of sex for money , more , or more eloquently than the women who really know what it is because they 're living it . That is the women who are living in this industry , most of whom are trafficked by international definition , because they are being pimped . And they want to get out , and they ca n't . </s>
Thus fitting the international definition of slavery . When you want to get out of marriage there’s a term called divorce . Eighty-five percent of women , when asked what they most want , that is women in prostitution , say what they want is to get out , but they don’t know how to . Usually they got in as children . Normally they got in as children . </s>
The majority . They were , most of them , sexually abused , actually , even before that . This is in the ninety percent plus range . That is , they were treated as a thing for sex before they ever had a chance to become a person first . And usually they are women , meaning their economic options are limited already by sex discrimination , precluding a vast majority of what men do for better pay , leaving , for the women who end up in prostitution the one remaining thing to be called her choice . </s>
This is a myth that one woman described for herself as , to be able to get out I had to believe I chose to get in . Sex , when it’s right , like friendship , is its own reward , it’s mutual , it’s equal in its diversity . You ca n't buy the real thing . In prostitution , women have sex with men they would never otherwise have sex with . The money thus acts as a form of force , not as a measure of consent . </s>
It acts like physical force does in rape . And as Kathleen Barry put it , the only difference between rape and prostitution is time , one ends , the other does n't . </s>
And then she is stigmatized and deprived of dignity by society , and criminalized by the legal system . So for her , what’s wrong with it is , it’s abusive , it’s intimately violative , it’s destructive , it’s damaging , it’s dangerous , it’s exploitative , and it’s unequal . It’s up to you to decide if this is right or wrong . We 're not here , actually , to discuss the proposition “it’s wrong to be paid for sex.” </s>
We are here to discuss the proposition , “it is wrong to pay for sex.” I’ve just been talking about what’s wrong with it for her . </s>
What’s wrong with it for him is , he’s using her , he’s exploiting her , he’s exploiting his inequality to her , which is usually a desperate economic inequality . In order to have access to her person in a form of bodily invasion , while he gets off on the illusion that he has chosen this freely , when he is taking more than can ever be paid for . And what he is buying is not only that chunk of her humanity called self-respect… And it is n't sex only , it’s you do what I say , sex . </s>
Now , to be against this is why those of us who are today supporting this proposition support the Swedish model . In this model , the seller is , well , the buyer is strongly criminalized . </s>
The seller has , is also strongly criminalized . In criminalizing the person who is the one who’s buying the sex , you are criminalizing the one that my desperately poor Indian clients , from India , call the real criminal . And you de-criminalize the sold . You couple this with real education , real employment opportunities , real jobs , real money . Women are entitled to real equality and real choices . </s>
Men presumably also need to pay for household expenses to put themselves through school , and you don’t find them , in general , not in anything like the numbers you find women , selling themselves on street corners . Women need real equality and real choices . We 're asking you to vote yes for the proposition as a way to weigh in on the side of the view that women and children are not for sale . </s>
And I 'm going to reserve the balance of my time for my rebuttal . We’ll remember that . Thank you . And that concludes round one of the debate tonight . Oh , I am so sorry , I skipped ahead on a card . </s>
I 'm so glad that you 're all here… …to keep me on the straight and narrow . I 'm sorry , Sydney . Sydney Biddle Barrows is a successful businesswoman and consultant who is most known for her work running a prostitution ring called Cache in the early 1980’s for about five years until her arrest . The tabloids were particularly drawn to the fact of your lineage , which you have captured in the title of the book you wrote about your experience as The Mayflower Madame . You had how many ancestors on the Mayflower ? </s>
Both sides , two— </s>
Both sides . Okay , so you have Puritans in your past . Ladies and gentleman , arguing— They 're all rolling over in their graves . Arguing against the motion , Sydney Biddle Barrows . </s>
Thank you . Freud once asked the question , what do women want ? And I would argue that what women want is their own money . And I have heard a lot of stories about , some really horrifying stories about young girls , people being trafficked , as Lionel said , this is just something , I mean I want them to throw away the key on these people . But what’s interesting is some of the statistics that I’ve been hearing , because what’s interesting is the only people that you can get these statistics from are the people at the very , very bottom , and they constitute a very small percentage of all of the working girls , at least in the United States . </s>
I can not speak for anywhere else . And because I have to tell you that I don’t recognize any of the kinds of clients that the opposition has talked about , I don’t recognize any of the kinds of girls that the opposition has talked about , so let me tell you a little bit about the experiences that I had , and that because I know so many people all over the United States that run escort services , or that have worked as working girls . There’s tens of hundreds of thousands of them . And let me tell you a little bit about a story . First of all , who’s really taking advantage of who ? </s>
I would argue that it is the women taking advantage of the men’s need for us . After all , who ends up with the money ? We do . </s>
Who’s the one who sets the price ? We do . They 're the ones who shell out because they want what we have . And if they don’t want to pay it , then they don’t get it . I mean , that 's , it’s as simple as that . </s>
So , I just , and by the way , can I just say that building an ugly building affects millions of people over hundreds of years , so… …so I did n't feel bad… But that was something just , she’s right , it absolutely offended me . I just , there’s some , a lot of ugly buildings out there . So let me tell you about some of the gals who worked for me , and who are fairly , this is the , first of all , most of them are students . I did not hire anyone under the age of nineteen , no one I know , and I know dozens and dozens of madames , ever hires girls under the age of eighteen . </s>
Never . I only took forty percent of the young lady’s earnings , and they wanted to give that money to me . </s>
They did n't have to . But , I took the phone calls , I 'm the one who set it up , I 'm the one who checked them out , I 'm the one who made sure they got the money if for some reason , you know , at the end of the evening he did n't pay , I would still pay her . </s>
And can I tell you something , in five and a half years , you should pardon the expression , we never once got stiffed . And we got… And we got the money at the end . So you know , they use the word pimp , and I 'm not saying that there are n't people out there that , that really fit that description , that are n't horrible people , but we’re not all like that . So , let me tell you about Colby . </s>
Colby was the daughter of a doctor , and she was used to living a very privileged life . </s>
She was in medical school , and she had several siblings who were either in college or medical school or law school or whatever . And Colby had a thing for , you know , beautiful clothes , six hundred dollar boots is actually the example she gave to me . And she came to work for me because she felt guilty asking her father , who had so many other , you know , of her siblings in school , to give her six hundred dollars for a pair of boots . </s>
This was Colby’s choice . But this is the reason she worked for me , so that she could have six hundred dollar boots . </s>
Sandy was a singer in a rock and roll band , and she and her band had finally broken through and had gotten a , a tour put together . And about three months before they were supposed to go on tour someone broke into the van and stole all their equipment . This was their chance to really be someone and really make it , and so everyone went to work doing something else , and Sandy came to work for me . You hear , and most of the girls , as I said before , were students . </s>
And the way I used to look at it is , here were the girls’ dreams on this side of the river . </s>
They wanted to be models , actresses , dancers , singers , they wanted a degree , they want , I had girls who wanted to be nurses , I had girls who wanted to be all different kinds of things . And , so this is their dream on this side of the gulch . And here they were over here , and they needed the money to pay the toll to the bridge to get to the other side so that they could have the life that they wanted . </s>
And they decided , and they could have done anything else , they decided that they wanted to do this . And it was their choice . And I know it’s going to , a lot of people are going to find this offensive , but I don’t think there’s one single solitary girl that worked for me who did n't come back after the very first time and say , I ca n't believe it was so easy . I ca n't believe I did n't do this before . </s>
I know , I know this is offensive to some people , but I mean , may a lightning bolt come down , this is what they said . And with respect to the guys , I mean , you should , we had terrific , we had a little Saudi prince who… …who wanted to have pillow fights , because when he was a kid he never got to have pillow fights . </s>
We had workaholics who had no time for a personal life , especially back in the early eighties , we had currency traders who , you know , were awake at all different times . They did n't have time for a girlfriend . Women were n't going to put up with guys who were never around . I mean , these were guys that women pay thousands of dollars to join these matchmaking services in order to meet . </s>
They were people who were between relationships , they wanted a sure thing . </s>
There were lonely travelers . There’s a lot of guys out there who were on the road , you know , week after week after week . They just want a little company . Now , when you figure that , we euphemistically call it the nitty-gritty , only lasted maybe five , seven , eight minutes , and yet the clients kept the young ladies for one hour , two hour , three hours , four hours . What were they really paying for ? </s>
If they , all they wanted was the sex , believe me , they could have gotten it for a hell of a lot less , we charged top dollar , that that’s not all that they pay for . A lot of them pay for the company , they pay because they just , they want a pretty girl to talk to and to have a good time with . I had a couple clients who had invalid wives who felt that it was cheating if they had a girlfriend , but they still had needs that they needed to have met . So , while it is true that there are a lot of bad people out there doing bad things to girls , I think to say that all of these girls are abused , that all of these girls are taken advantage of , that they 're all traumatized , yes , there are some , but it’s certainly not the majority , and I , believe me , I want them to throw away the key on these people too . </s>
But , I think to tar everyone with the same brush is just not being realistic , because there are a lot of good people out there who are doing this . </s>
And to criminalize these girls , and to give them records so that they ca n't go and live a normal life just to me does n't seem right . </s>
Thank you , Sydney Biddle Barrows . That concludes round one of our debate . I need to say that without you laughing at me for the radio broadcast , or you can just sit in silence , but I just need to say it without the laughter , because it would be impossible to explain to the audience , radio audience… That concludes round one of our debate . You 're , you 're very kind . </s>
What had happened , I got distracted by the results from the initial vote , which I find quite surprisingly lopsided , but we will share them with you now . As things stand now , twenty percent of you are for the motion , fifty percent of you are against , and thirty percent of you are undecided . And recall that we will have you vote again towards the end , and we chose the winner depending on which side has moved the most votes . </s>
So we’re going to move now onto round two , and in round two the debaters speak directly to one another , and we also take questions from you . What will happen is , we have people in the audience who will come to you if you raise your hand . Catch my attention , and I’ll signal a microphone to be brought over toward you . And when you take the microphone please hold it about a fist away from your mouth so that we can hear you in the hall , and also so that the radio recording can pick you up as well . </s>
But I want to kick off the questions first by turning to the panel and saying , after hearing the opening statements I feel as though I 'm hearing two teams debate two entirely different worlds , one in which , in one world , in one of these worlds prostitutes are workers . In the other world , prostitutes are captives . In one world prostitutes have free choice , in another world prostitutes have no choice whatsoever . </s>
And I , especially given the description that you left us with , Sydney , of you 're talking about young women making choices , I want to ask anybody from the opposing side to address that point with Sydney on the matter of choice . Particularly Catharine , you had said that there really is no free will , if you are a prostitute it is never your choice . I would like you to address that , or any of your teammates , to the other team . CATHARINE MacKINNON I did n't say what you just said . </s>
I said that it’s always in a context of sex inequality in which your options are precluded , to begin with , and as Melissa pointed out , there’s a dramatic amount of racial and class based bias in the people who are actually in this industry . And you know , prostitution is what women do when all else fails , and all else fails often . And there are a lot of things that men do , in general , when all else fails , and prostitution is not that thing . </s>
And that means this is an institution of sex inequality . It is . </s>
And you know , when , but I would also note , that we actually agree with , that is , Miss Barrows and us concur in the view that the sold in this , the women , the girls , when they are boys or men , should not be criminals . They should be , the prostituted people need to be de-criminalized , firmly . </s>
That is the Swedish model . And it’s the buyers who we’re here to talk about , the johns that Melissa described . </s>
And whether , what it is , what it is they are doing when they are buying people . </s>
You 're teammate , Melissa Farley . I would like to quote , to respond to what Sydney said , and quote from her book , which is , she said , “A call girl is simply a woman who hates poverty more than she hates sin.” I would use the word prostitution and not sin , so I would say a call girl is simply a woman who hates poverty more than she hates prostitution . I think that’s the whole point we’re making here , that should n't be the choice . If we’re seeking an end to inequality between men and women , if we’re seeking an end to violence against men and women , women should not have to make the choice between poverty and education , paying the next month’s rent , and prostitution . </s>
From the other side , Lionel Tiger . I 'm sorry that this whole discussion now is focused on prostitution . I thought that what we were talking about was the economics of human sexuality , and that is really the parsimonious fundamental issue that we have here . People engage , and I mention the engagement ring in marriages , which have immense responsibilities to the next generation , to communities , to relatives , to friends , and we’re somehow putting the immensely complex and , and both luxurious and difficult business of being an adult lover into the same rubric as prostitutes who , and I think there’s an argument to be made that it , yes it’s terrible , now we’re starting to hear how this all expresses sexual inequality and racial equality . </s>
Please , let’s try to limit the discussion to the subject of human sexuality and stop including every single allergic category that comes into these discussions— When , when do— CATHARINE MacKINNON Like reality , for example ? When , what Lionel is doing is saying that buying a diamond ring is paying for sex , and do— Yeah , I think it’s actually the negative team that is equating , in equating marriage and dating with paying for sex . The negative team is conflating things that should not be conflated . </s>
First of all , in prostitution there’s no shared desire . </s>
Right ? Which means one person is an object . </s>
That 's a big difference . Also , marriages in which there is a transactional element , in which it’s , okay , you give me this , I’ll give you this , there’s a fifty-fifty exchange of services , end up failing precisely because that’s not what a marriage is . Right ? But I want to address the free choice issue , because Miss Barrows says that she does n't recognize any of the girls , or the men . So I just want to refresh her memory . </s>
Because I thought her book was really interesting . And she said , quote , quite a few of the new girls that she used had no money and nothing appropriate to wear , so I would take them to Saks and charge whatever they needed on my credit card . They would pay me back from their future earnings . When she found a fabulous ground floor apartment for her office , which was super cheap , the rate was made up for by making the girls sleep with the landlord , who she said was only interested in one thing , and lived in a seedy semi-furnished apartment and made them feel cheap . She says the girls were n't crazy about the plan , and really one can see why . </s>
Is that free choice ? </s>
That does n't sound like empowerment to me . </s>
To me empowerment comes from actualizing your unique potential in the world . </s>
That’s what empowerment is . Realizing you 're unique , and you have a unique contribution to make to this world , not being forced to sleep with a landlord to enrich somebody else’s pockets . I 'm sorry . </s>
Tyler Cowen , you want to come back to that . Our moderator is a very objective fellow , and what he’s pointed out is that there are many different worlds here . And this is true . </s>
And what I would like you to do is to think through the implications of there being many different worlds . The other side is asking for a blanket condemnation of a practice . I 'm asking you to see many different worlds , to understand this diversity of human preference , experience , and culture . </s>
And once we view the debate in this terms , in my view , the correct answer is to side with us , that there is no blanket condemnation , it is a diverse set of situations with many entirely acceptable outcomes , a lot of very bad outcomes , and the other side is simply pressing the emotional buttons again and again and again on the bad outcomes , and trying to press all of our buttons . And I urge you to resist that , to stand back , look at the bigger picture , and do not issue the blanket condemnation . Tyler , you 're saying sometimes it’s okay to pay for sex ? There are many instances where the practice is badly regulated and we observe bad outcomes . </s>
Trafficking is an example . </s>
None of us are defending that , but that’s not the proposition . Is it , to the other team , is it ever , is there a sometimes , or sometimes it’s okay to pay for sex ? Melissa Farley ? </s>
I would like to address this trafficked toddlers issue , which is basically ranking victims . </s>
When you decide that a battered woman is not really harmed because her arm wasn’t broken , or a slave is n't harmed as much if they 're in the house as opposed to in the fields , or a woman in prostitution is not harmed as much if she’s a little older . And I’d like to tell you that a friend of mine who works in the field of child prostitution recently told me that there’s now a move to only rank genuine victims of prostitution of children if they 're pre- pubescent . So the age is always going down , we’re always carving out some group that it’s okay to use in prostitution . I think when we make these false distinctions , we’re agreeing to set aside a class of human beings , the ones that make more , they 're a little older , a little this , a little that . </s>
We’re setting aside some people who’s suffering we agree to ignore . We 're going to go to audience questions now and bring up the house lights , and begin to raise your hands , and we’ll get microphones over to you . </s>
But Melissa , I don’t , in a way I think you actually glanced off my question with what you were saying , but Tyler Cowen is arguing that sometimes it’s okay to pay for sex . </s>
He used the example of sexual surrogates , he used the example , not using the word quadriplegic , but that was implied , that somebody who may not have an opportunity for another sexual experience , and therefore hires a prostitute . </s>
And he says that in those cases sometimes it is okay to pay for sex . Right— Wendy Shalit ? Yes , I’d like to address that , because I think those are really important points that he raised . </s>
If you show me anyone who , a man who is handicapped , I will give you a man with the same disability who has a woman who loves him . </s>
And women are not that superficial . And if somebody , if , I 'm sorry , there’s a lot of women who love men… And , and… If there’s somebody who’s using prostitution as an excuse , I think that 's a problem . And I , about this issue of , that prostitution is really altruism because it’s feeding , you know , poor women , and that’s part of the diversity , I understand that , but I fail to see how that justifies it from the male perspective . If you really want to be altruistic , just give her a loaf of bread . A question from the middle of the aisle . </s>
And , and I beg you to keep it terse . </s>
Oh yeah , no , of course . Thanks . Hi . So I 'm in college , and I remember very distinctly that when I was in middle school our sexual education is a three year program , but there are only so many ways that you can describe , you know , the act of sex , so what we focused on eventually was disease , and I was wondering if anybody on the panel had any opinions about disease in this scenario , especially , I would like to ask specifically Miss Barrows about , if she had any experiences with this while she was running Cache . </s>
Back when I was in business , there was no such thing as AIDS . Well , there was in the gay community but no one really heard about it yet , because I was out of business in 1984 . The way that this , the upscale call girl business ran back then is , the young ladies did not wear condoms . </s>
If , I mean , the men did n't wear condoms , and young ladies could n't insist on it . If they did not agree to that , then they did n't have to work for us . But I mean , the thing , there was pretty much nobody they could have worked for in the city , because that’s the way everybody did it . I do have to say that we did have , once , we had a problem with gonorrhea , I paid for all my young ladies to go to the doctor , and I also called up all the other agencies that I knew were sort of in my category , and told them that , you know , we should , everybody should insist that the clients wear condoms . </s>
And you know what these other women said to me , what do you care about these girls ? They , you know , they would n't care this much about you . And I was absolutely horrified . So you know , there… It’s true that there are a lot of bad people out there who are running businesses like this , but there are also a lot of people out there , because I 'm not the only one , who genuinely care about the girls who work for us , and would never , ever , ever put them knowingly in harm’s way . Melissa Farley do you want to also take up the question of , based on your research , and take up the disease question , and is it central to the argument ? </s>
It’s not what we heard from women in prostitution that this is their main concern , is physical , even physical injuries . The main concern is to get out and to figure out how to get out . And the thing that causes them the most suffering is the psychological damage that’s extremely long lasting . The bruises and the -- they even heal from the rapes . </s>
So this is what I’ve heard . I think when someone , let me , cac I say one other thing— Yes , please do . </s>
…about disability ? I think prejudice against someone who has a physical or emotional disability is wrong . </s>
The cure to that prejudice is not selling someone to that person so they can have sex . The cure is to address the disability-ism , and the looks-ism in our culture . I’ve told you that you’d be number two , I’d like to put you to number three , because I’d like to bring different sexes into the discussion . </s>
And there’s a gentleman , and you’ll be third… Yes , you’ll be number three . </s>
My question is for Professor Cowen , there was a case in Germany , I actually don’t know what the outcome was , but assuming that this is a country where there is well regulated prostitution , where a woman was denied unemployment benefits because she had not tried to become a prostitution . </s>
So , my question for you is , if prostitution , is if we’re going to have a well regulated prostitution , is it going to be treated like any other profession ? Because if so , obviously every woman always has that alternative , and therefore the state can ask women to become prostitutes instead of getting unemployment benefits . My understanding of the German story is that it’s quite different from how you described it , that the woman simply was given a list and asked what other professions she had tried to seek out , that she was not in any way forced to become a prostitute . </s>
But putting that example aside , if indeed that were the case , that is an example of a silly rule , a silly regulation . </s>
None of us here are for that . But pointing out that that’s a silly way of running unemployment benefits does not establish the blanket condemnation behind this principle . Does the opposing team have a response to that ? No ? Ma'am , your turn . </s>
Norma Ramos from the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women . </s>
My question I would like to have addressed by Dr. Farley and Catharine MacKinnon . We keep hearing that the solution is better regulation . </s>
I’d like you both to address what the real experiences are in the countries such as the Netherlands and Germany that are regulating the commercial sexual exploitation of women , which we at the coalition against trafficking in women refer to as the world’s oldest oppression . Catharine MacKinnon . CATHARINE MacKINNON Yeah , Germany is actually thinking about the Swedish model at this point , having discovered that a tremendous amount of trafficking is produced by the draw of legalization . And that’s the same as in the Netherlands , although they 're not considering the Swedish model at this point , but are looking to try to address the abuses that happen as a direct result of their legalization , across the board legalized initiatives . </s>
The other thing that happens in countries , for example , or in parts of countries like Australia where you regulate it better , that is in the interest of trying to reduce the violence and the illness and other forms of abuses of the people , women in prostitution , you create a legal industry so you can regulate it well , that’s their whole attempt . What ends up happening , you know , apart from the fact that you ca n't put anything in the rooms like pillows because they 're a lethal weapon , or sheets , because somebody might get tied down by them , so it’s a pretty bare prostitution experience . </s>
What happens is that the men who want to buy all the things that are abusive and dangerous and destructive to the women , in addition to the psychological , which remains the same , go to the ever-exploding illegal industry around it . Right ? So you legalize it in the name of having a well regulated prostitution industry , and exploding around it is the illegal industry for which there is no legal structure to address , for all the men who , to begin with , want to have sex without condoms . </s>
Tyler Cowen , your opponent , does that mean you 're , you have been arguing that it can be regulated to safety and— Go ahead . </s>
CATHARINE MacKINNON Apparently he’s a lot smarter than , you know , several hundred years worth of other people who have tried to regulate and who have a million different ideas about how to do it . Tyler Cowen . I spoke at length about New Zealand , there’s a several hundred page study about the experience which I have read . The other side has not uttered a peep about this , and even in the example of Germany , it’s just been admitted , the real problem is the illegal trade , which in some way should be de-criminalized . </s>
The European model can be improved , but for the most part the Western European model has worked better than what we do right here . </s>
This is widely understood throughout the world . Melissa Farley . I actually have read the New Zealand report , and I also have studied prostitution in New Zealand , and one of the things that happened in New Zealand is what a Maori community activist called an apartheid system of prostitution . In New Zealand , the Maori people are prostituted much younger and much longer , and they 're more frequently homeless , so we again have that situation in New Zealand of a special class of people who are more vulnerable— </s>
But Melissa are , are you saying that regulation can never wipe out abuses , or do you just not like the idea anyway ? Well , let’s talk about the regulation . What happens in real life in New Zealand , to stick with that for a moment , is that zoning is the sine qua non of regulation of prostitution . You mean where , where an establishment is , where it happens ? </s>
The people who have a lot of money don’t want it in their backyards , so it’s zoned into the neighborhoods of poorer people , thereby increasing trafficking , johns , solicitations , and their general vulnerability to all aspects of the sex industry . This happened in New Zealand , so— But the clarification I 'm looking for is that— Sorry . </s>
…if Tyler is right , and ultimately a system could be , of regulation could be developed to avoid the sorts of abuses that have been talking about , would that be okay with you ? I , what… Here’s the answer to that… It’s counter- intuitive . </s>
It’s been tried , and it did n't work . </s>
The Mayor of Amsterdam said , and I think this is true of many people , we thought it would work to regulate . Well-intentioned people thought it would work to regulate , and it did n't . It actually , it’s very counter-intuitive . </s>
He said , what , they 're shutting down over a third of the legal brothels in Amsterdam right now . </s>
Why ? Because eighty percent of the women in Dutch legal prostitution are moved there from economically stricken Europe , and because there’s organized crime that’s out of control . Legalization is a pimp magnet , so I mean , that’s the answer . </s>
If we know that it does n't work , it’s been tried , but— A , a quick , I— Can I just respond to that , I— I was going to actually try to get the next question to go to you , how about that ? </s>
I just wanted to know , I 'm just— I guess not . No , I do . I just wanted to know , because I have n't heard the answer to this , on this point , if I may . </s>
If it’s a question of being badly regulated , then why do we see in the countries where it’s been legalized , we see that the trafficking has increased . Nobody has addressed my point that nobody asks the ages of the girls when they pay for sex , and that’s the link between the trafficking . And no one has addressed that so far . From the , from the black please . Gentleman ? </s>
Okay , this is for the women who say it’s wrong to pay for sex— Let’s aim this towards one— First , just want to establish , fact , is it okay for you guys that a woman be a professional female masseuse and give massage therapy to a man . Absolutely . </s>
Okay . </s>
No problem with that . </s>
It is okay if a man goes to a particular masseuse because he finds her extremely attractive and is turned on by it , and only receives massage therapy ? We’re talking slippery slope here , I think . I can see it getting slippery . That’s , so that’s okay ? </s>
All right , third question , if during that process— </s>
Not if the man were my husband . If during that process… …he has an orgasm , even though the woman did n't do anything out of the ordinary , did only professional massage therapy , is that okay ? I don’t know , I mean , I think this is a kind of…extreme example— This one has stymied… </s>
I think what you're— </s>
I don’t think what— I think what you 're trying to do with the question is collapse the distinction between human touch and the significance of sex . </s>
And I think sex is different and just because you 're giving someone a massage , I mean , there’s nothing wrong with that . But I think that sexuality is something different , and you can always come up with an extreme example to collapse that distinction , but that just begs the question . </s>
Okay , we are halfway through the direct head to head part of the debate . I want to remind you I 'm John Donvan , your moderator , and I want to now go to the other side of the table , Lionel Tiger , who argues against the motion , wants to pick up on that last point . Well , first of all I , there’s a kind of a historical component to the other side . </s>
There’s a famous syndrome in Turkey , rural Turkey , the Natasha . The Natasha is a Russian woman who goes to a small town in Turkey and capsizes the entire system because she’s sexually available . Now , the reason Natasha is there is because the men in Russia are drunk all the time , they have very low longevity , they are improper and not very useful husbands , the result is the birth rate in Russia , which is plummeting , it’s a major crisis actually . But the reason for the Natashas comes out of a really poignant human story . And I continue to feel that we’re losing not the nicety of the argument here , we’re losing the grandeur of the human issues that force some people into a small , intimate room , where they do something , and yes , it causes some people the distress that we’ve heard about . </s>
None of us on this side applauds that . At the same time , this is not exactly a trivial issue and I’m afraid it’s being reduced in its importance into a sentimental kind of grab bag of victim complaints— </s>
Why sentimental . Well… Because it’s easy . It’s all very—it’s easy in this country and everywhere else to talk about racial , class distinctions and so on . </s>
Many of the clients of prostitutes I suspect , don’t have a great deal more money than the prostitutes , I don’t know . Essentially what I’m trying to do here is , get the argument into the larger context of , of human sexuality , and away from a relatively , again sentimental concern . </s>
There was just—if I may make one final comment on this , there was recently the publication and we’ve known in the primatology trade about it for years , that it turns out that chimp males who hunt , will give meat to women who— To women ? —will—if—a female— Maybe . </s>
To female chimps , and the—but the fascinating thing is it’s not just a quid pro quo . Because these become sustained and durable relationships , in which the male is a consort and an associate of the female , even when she’s not in estrus and therefore sexually available . And that is , it’s kind of haunting . Because it suggests that , this is actually a more elegant phenomenon than just giving meat to a female . </s>
Okay . Uh— I see Wendy Shalit is quite anxious to come in on this . I’m— I have to admit I’m— </s>
Wendy , can you just find your microphone— </s>
Sure— Thanks . Sorry . I’m surprised by the negatives’ reliance on the argument that it’s not going away and historically , a lot of people have been doing it . We’re not debating whether it’s common , to pay for sex , we’re not debating whether it’s happened , we’re arguing whether it’s right or wrong . </s>
And , I think , I mean , if you bring up primatology , I’m just—I have to bring up , Mr. Tiger , your book which I really enjoyed The Pursuit of Pleasure which was a pleasure to read…by the way , I must say . I found one example really interesting , you mentioned female genital mutilation . </s>
And you said what’s significant about female genital mutilation , is that men , males want sexual access to women , but they can not bear it when other men have access to their mates . A common solution to the problem is the double standard , of which female genital mutilation you say is the extreme representation . </s>
Here the effort is to try to control both sex and reproduction at once , by imposing strict controls on the sexuality of women . In an effort to prevent their wives’ impregnation by men other than themselves . Now , I think we can always , you bring up chimps and primatology , we can explain yes female genital mutilation in terms of primatology but I hope we can all agree that that’s still wrong . And , just because— </s>
Question from the right side— —just because the chimps can provide an explanation doesn’t mean that it’s right . The questioner is over on the far right here . </s>
My question is for Mr. Cowen . You made a distinction between toddlers who are prostituted and adults who are prostituted . </s>
Sometimes , adults who are prostituted enter prostitution as toddlers or children . So— Now , could you move the mic— </s>
Yeah . Thank you . My question to you is…a simple one . </s>
Is it okay to buy a 20-year- old woman , if that woman entered prostitution as a four-year-old , a 10-year-old , a 12-year-old . Probably not . </s>
There are plenty of cases , as I am more than willing to admit , where what goes on , is wrong . But again , look at the resolution . The key point is that there are diverse practices , and multiple worlds . What you’re finding from the other side , is to take a woman in a difficult situation , choosing her best option . </s>
I’m saying , blame the difficult situation . </s>
They’re saying , blame the best option . It’s a very simple choice . Which one are you going to blame . </s>
Again I say blame the difficult situation . </s>
Gentleman in the far left . Hello , good evening . My name is , I’m a professor of psychology at the New School for Social Research and I have a question for the panel in favor of the motion . </s>
When you were describing your prototypical prostitute , it came to mind for me , a prototypical coalmine worker . Typically exploited for two or three generations , they had no other chance but going to the mines , and typically they suffer long-term mental and physical health consequences , consequences for their employment . </s>
And I suspect that you would make a difference between this and you would argue that they’re two different cases . </s>
And my—I suspect that your making difference on this would be based on disgust . And as many a philosopher of law have argued , and I agree with basic— I need you to get— I think we see where you’re going but I need you to get to a question . Yes , so the question is where it is on disgust that you make this , this difference , and I would argue that this would not be appropriate , as many philosophers have argued , we should not , legislate on the base of disgust . </s>
We’re talking— Melissa Farley— —about the evidence of harm here , not a moral or emotional reaction . And the evidence of harm , I think the other side has just conceded the debate , if it’s wrong to prostitute someone who was a child when they entered prostitution , then what we know , and there’s no argument about these numbers , is that in the vicinity of 75 to 85 or 90 percent of everyone in prostitution , entered prostitution as a legal minor , oftentimes , a 13- or 14- year-old . That’s a fact . </s>
Sydney Barrows . When she says that’s a fact , you—that may be a fact with respect to the people who have been interviewed , but you have to remember , that the people who are interviewed for this sort of thing , are a great minority , they are the ones that are in the most trouble , they’re the ones that end up , you know , being the most messed up . And so they’re the ones that these people get to talk to and to interview , and I’m not debating that these people have horrible problems . But to take a small minority and to apply their problems to the majority , is just— wrong . </s>
Catharine MacKinnon . CATHARINE MacKINNON This research has been very carefully designed so that they really are a representative sample of people at all levels , at all stages , at all class divisions , positions , in the industry . What’s being described by Ms. Barrows is research she doesn’t know . And , it… What—and the PTSD rates don’t vary according to class level , is the other thing to remember . </s>
As to coalmine work and its negative consequences , what you describe is some people’s human rights are being violated through this work , that—in the way that it’s being done , in the coalmine industry . </s>
They have human rights and they need to be recognized . What we’re talking about is people whose human rights are being violated , and they need to be addressed . </s>
Now as it happens , whenever someone else is selling you for sex , you are trafficked , and your human rights are being violated . The vast majority of people in the sex industry , somebody else is taking the pimp’s cut off their prostitution . </s>
And they’re do—and this is what is being bought when you’re buying sex , this is the reality of it , it is an industry of human rights violation . Question from the top , please . We have criminal laws against child abuse , we have criminal laws against slavery , there are criminal laws that cover this kind of , of repression of human rights . </s>
Now , as far as prostitution is concerned , if you take out the children that have been prostituted and the people who are held against their will , what you have is a contractual relationship . And…I don’t see anything wrong with that . CATHARINE MacKINNON Then what you have is at most 3 percent of the industry . Is that what you’re defending ? Yeah , but I don’t know where you get that— Why would an upscale call girl even bother to be interviewed . </s>
The people that you don’t hear from are the ones—what’s in it for them ? </s>
They have no problem with it , they’re not about to go and bitch and complain that they’re being , you know , abused , when they’re perfectly happy about it , you only hear from the unhappy people . CATHARINE MacKINNON Well , I don’t think that’s— One of the things— Melissa Farley— </s>
One of the things— CATHARINE MacKINNON — research is done . One of the things— We don’t get to hear what your— Melissa—Melissa Farley . One of the things researchers have attempted to do is to increase the numbers of people we interview in indoor prostitution . </s>
Because it has been argued , and it has been my experience , that indoor prostitution and legal brothels and massage parlors and upscale call girl agencies , is often the—where the most harmed people are held , the most trafficked , the youngest . And so , you can’t make that assumption . Researchers , not myself , another person in San Francisco , and I’ve had this experience too , is that when we try to talk to pimps about interviewing their…“girls , ” we’re denied permission to speak with them . </s>
I don’t think it— Syd—Sydney , I’m , I’ve…you’re rolling your eyes and I’d like to put some words behind that . I just…this whole thing is just so absurd I wouldn’t even know where to start . I mean… There is nothing in it for the girls who don’t have a problem with it to talk to these researchers , why would they bother . </s>
Wendy— You don’t even know how many of them are out there— </s>
they don’t have a problem . </s>
Wendy Shalit ? I don’t think it’s accurate to say that we haven’t heard from these high-end call girls , we have heard from them . </s>
For example in your book , Ms. Barrows , you talked about Claudette , she’s the most empowered call girl , right , and she herself said this kind of work can be very taxing both physically and emotionally . “I’ve never met a man who can really understand what it takes out of you.” And I think that even the most supposedly empowered call girls when they are interviewed , do say thing— say things like this— But see you took that in a negative way . </s>
No , but— I think that— </s>
Claudette loved— Ladies and gentlemen— </s>
—being a call girl— —ladies and gentlemen , that concludes Round 2 of our debate . So , we are now in the final stretch and soon you in our audience will be choosing the winner , and recall that at the start of the debate we asked you whether you took sides with or against the motion before us , which is , “It is wrong to pay for sex.” </s>
Here are the results from your vote before the debate . </s>
20 percent of you were for the motion that it is wrong to pay for sex . 50 percent were against , and , 30 percent were undecided , and we don’t have it on the graphic but I’ll share with you , that the for— in the “for” category , it was 2 to 1 , women to men . In the “against” category , it was 3 to 2 , men to women . And undecided was roughly equal . </s>
So , we’re gon na go to closing statements now , that’s Round 3 , and right after that , we will ask you to vote another time and remember we’re gon na end twice , once with the simple results and then , round of applause from all of you , and then we will share with you the breakdown by sex for those votes . So on to Round 3 , closing statements by each of the debaters , speaking first against the motion , Lionel Tiger , anthropology professor at Rutgers University . </s>
You’re using my time . Basically—I’ll have to repeat I’m afraid what I already said which is that , we have taken a subset of human behavior which we all disagree with and despise , which is coercive , which is as the speaker just before mentioned is covered by painfully wrought criminal law and so on , and we’ve turned that into a metaphor , and then a description of the common human experience that we all have of men and women or men and men or women and women together . And somehow , in the description we lose the generosity of spirit , the sense of adventure , the intensity , and , let us not forget , and not mentioning primates again , but sex is about human evolution , it’s about reproduction , it’s the most important thing any species has to attend to . And it would be a great surprise , if it were not confounded by glitches , sometimes tragic ones , it would be a great surprise if everyone was in agreement about it . We have , talking about prostitution , Indian girls are betrothed at the age of four to a guy who’s five and they are married , but they obviously can’t perform as married couples until they reach a certain age . </s>
The Kama Sutra , that famous book that nobody’s ever been able to succeed in emulating , was given to the new couple when they finally were married so they could practice this great craft of sex . </s>
I’m , all I want to protect here , is the notion that sex is not a disease , that sexual interaction is not necessarily an expletive , exploitative phenomenon , that it has its own legitimacy , its own agenda , and it will and has continued , in much the same way and a sensible society will try to make it better— Thank you— </s>
—not to criminalize it— Thank you , Lionel Tiger . I wan na point out that in our closing round , each debater is given a brief amount of time , two minutes each , to make a closing statement and a final appeal for your vote and now , summarizing her position for the motion , Wendy Shalit , author of The Good Girl Revolution : Young Rebels with Self-Esteem and High Standards . Thank you , I certainly agree that sex is not a disease , so I’m glad we can , perhaps all agree on that… Look , nobody has addressed my point that , no one asks the ages of the girls , when they pay for sex , and that is the link between the trafficking of children , as well , and , so you wan na , I think , consider that , that’s something that nobody has addressed and it makes those paying for sex responsible . Look , I think…since the 1960s , we’ve been beholden to this false dichotomy that , you know , you’re either a repressed person who has no feelings , or the prudes , or you’re the liberated who goes around with everyone , and treats sex casually and I don’t think this dichotomy really captures the experience of most women or most men for that matter . </s>
And I think we need to revive the idea of higher standards for both sexes . And , that sex is a good thing , but we don’t have to take advantage of the most vulnerable in our society when we choose our sexual partners . </s>
The devaluing of women and children’s innocence that happens in a society that makes sex into a commodity , to validate that , and to declare that paying for sex is perfectly fine , is to say something about society’s relationship to women and especially girls that I think would be detrimental . But also to men . You’ve—yes , we’ve all read that Times article about sugar daddies , but to me what was so touching was the man who went on the website , and he just gave the girl a monthly stipend for her education . And he refused to have sex with her and this is what the debate is about , it’s about who we want to be . And who knows the far-reaching consequences of that , that he went on this somewhat depressing website , but he was capable of such greatness and saying no , you know what , I’m not going to pay for sex . </s>
And , if you think that what the man did didn’t matter , that he supported her education without even meeting her , and you think he could’ve just as easily paid for sex , and that would’ve been the same choice morally then vote for the negative team , but if you can see the beauty in that choice , which he made in the privacy of his own home , and not in any courtroom , then , vote for the proposition— Thank you— —because we’re not a monkey , men are not monkeys and women— Thank you , Wendy Shalit— </s>
—women are not chicken . Thank you . Thank you . Summarizing against the motion , Tyler Cowen , economics professor at George Mason University . Rather than repeat my major points , I’d like to focus on one small answer . </s>
The issue came up , what if a man is a quadriplegic , and wants to buy sex . The opposition still hasn’t answered this question , in my opinion , their responses were , to put it bluntly , lame . Women will come around , let’s teach women disability should not be a problem , that’s fine , no one will disagree with that . But what about , dot , dot , dot . </s>
There simply was no answer . The other side would’ve been much better simply saying look , that’s an exception to the principle , in that case it’s fine . But they can not bring themselves to give that humane answer . I think when push comes to shove , there’s something about the notion of informed , consenting adults , which is what’s at stake here…making an exchange that they simply do not like . If you’re in any doubt , just consider different parts of the world , and where they would line up in this debate . </s>
The notion that there are real abuses , but that buying sex is something that we should tolerate , is extremely common in western Europe . </s>
The kinds of arguments you’re hearing on the other side . </s>
If you look at the debates over prostitution in the country of Iran , you hear exactly , and I mean exactly the same arguments in Iran , that you have heard from the people on the other side of this debate . If you look at what some aspects of what the religious right push for , the arguments they make , it is very similar to what you have heard on the other side of this debate . If you’re in any doubt , ask yourself , in which set of societies with which set of attitudes would you rather live . Western Europe , or the kinds of places and cultures , where the attitude toward prostitution is that which you find to my right . Think about that , and then please vote accordingly . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Tyler Cowen . Summarizing her position for the motion , “It is wrong to pay for sex , ” Melissa Farley , a psychologist and Prostitution Research and Education . I think it’s wrong to pay for sex , there’s no mutuality of sexual pleasure or any other kind of power in prostitution , where one person has the social , legal , and economic power to buy another person , and to use them as a sexualized puppet . By the way one of the kinds of damages we haven’t talked about today , is the damage to women’s sexuality after being in prostitution for a long time . </s>
They usually are not capable of any kind of sexual intimacy , that reflects the years of selling that act in prostitution . </s>
They say , that’s stolen from them . Men who are sold in prostitution experience exactly the same kinds of damage to their sexuality , and the similar symptoms of traumatic stress . </s>
Maybe the primates we should take a lesson from , are the bonobos , who , when female bonobos are co-dominant , males are less aggressive and females are more sexual . There’s a lot of sexuality in bonobo society , everyone’s having sex . </s>
But it’s used for mutual pleasure , it’s used to cement social bonds . And by the way the first time a male—adolescent male gets sexually aggressive , the female elder bonobos get together and kick his ass . He— He learns from that one experience that that’s not what sex is . </s>
So , one other comment about legalization of prostitution , it really is a failed experiment , the same numbers of women in legal prostitution in Nevada want to escape it , the same numbers are homeless , as in other kinds of prostitution . The institution of prostitution is built on the exploitation and abuse of women , it can’t be fixed , only abolished . I’m relentlessly optimistic about men’s capacity for change . </s>
It’s wrong to buy sex . Thank you , Melissa Farley . </s>
Summarizing her position against the motion , the Mayflower Madame , Sydney Biddle Barrows . Well , people have tried to legislate human nature and morality for centuries , and it’s never worked . It’d be great if it did , but it doesn’t . So we have to get real . </s>
Now , it is true that , it’s…when it comes to the younger girls , I think it’s tragic and I don’t understand why we are not absolutely prosecuting to the fullest extent of the law , men who want to have sex with a young girl—I mean I’m talking really young girls and children . don’t want to do that . And , I think to… as I said before to paint everyone with the same tar brush , is not right . Because , there are a lot of men who pay for sex because they feel— and I—oh , I’m gon na hear the hisses on this one—that it’s being respectful . </s>
Now what is more disrespectful or respectful . A man’s in a bar , he pours 30 , 40 dollars’ worth drinks down a girl’s throat , says oh , you know , I’m really feeling something for you . There could really be something here . Why don’t you come up and see my etchings . So she goes up , she sees his etchings , and he has his way with her ‘cause she’s so drunk that she can’t practically say no , and then oh yes , oh sure , I’ll call you tomorrow , he never does…she’s just been used . </s>
But a guy who thinks that a woman is worth it , he calls up and he says , I think that it’s worth $ 500 an hour , for me to pay to have sex with you , I think you’re worth it , I wan na give it to you , I don’t wan na pour $ 40 worth of drinks down your throat and steal it from you . </s>
I wan na give it to you . </s>
And so , I don’t think that there’s anything—I mean , you have a lot of very honest men out there , who pay for it because they feel it’s being more respectful . Not for children , not for trafficked women , but there are huge amounts of men out there who pay for it because they believe it’s the right thing do , that it’s a fair exchange , and they want and they choose to do it , and we should—the women should be allowed to take the money . Why not . Thank you , Sydney Barrows . </s>
And our final speaker tonight , summarizing her position for the motion , “It is wrong to pay for sex , ” Catharine MacKinnon , professor of law at the University of Michigan . CATHARINE MacKINNON Thanks . From the other side we’ve heard that paying for sex is old . That it’s diverse . </s>
That it’s natural . </s>
Although I don’t think there are any pimps among chimps . That… that there’s a global grandeur to human sexuality . </s>
And , also I think in essence that there’s nothing wrong with it if you get paid for it but you aren’t the one that has to do it . But we haven’t heard an argument about why it’s right . And little bit about why some aspects of it might not be wrong , entirely . But nobody’s really saying why it’s right . And to be on the cash nexus , with sex . </s>
When this gets , you know , pushed down to the fine edges of the slippery slope we essentially are having a , you know , if they get their way , what can we still have , department . And UNESCO , which is a United Nations entity , has this to say about the relation of what we’ve been talking about , sexual victimization , and the economic exchange , they say , “Sexual victimization”— this is a quote— “has been found to be the first step in the breakdown of a woman’s identity , which is necessary , to render the human body into a sexual commodity for economic exchange.” That’s I think what it is . It’s not only about—what that’s saying is , I think , is that what’s right about sex , is what paying for it violates . The hard issue I think for our side is , what to do when women aren’t paid for anything else . </s>
I’ve recently been working with 13-year-old girls who are the sole support of their families , an inter-generational caste-based prostitution in India . </s>
And they are the ones who are saying , not…how can you take this one and only thing away from us that is the only thing that anyone will buy . They are the ones who are saying , give us any real option . This—our economic desperation that has put us in this position , is not all our lives can be . </s>
And , they’re saying , in Mr. Cowen’s terms , change the difficult situation . Now , the other thing that is not being addressed by the other side is the question , why aren’t men being sold for sex . Like by the millions worldwide in the same ways and in the same proportions women are , it seems me , that if being bought and sold for sex is part of the grandeur of human sexuality that men are really missing out on something here . </s>
Thank you , Catharine MacKinnon . CATHARINE MacKINNON So… </s>
And that concludes Round 3— CATHARINE MacKINNON Women vote—women vote 1— Clo—closing statements— CATHARINE MacKINNON —men vote 4 . Okay ? And it is now time for you to pick the winner , the motion before us once again is…it is wrong to pay for sex . And if you turn to your keypads…keys number 1 , 2 , and 3 , are for females in the audience , 4 , 5 and 6 are for males . </s>
All the other numbers are for the bonobos . And we’ll give you about 30 seconds to lock that in . Is it bone-a-bos or bon-a-bos . </s>
Bon-a-bos— ? Bonobos . Does anybody need more time ? </s>
Okay , recall , in about three or four minutes we’ll have the results tabulated and we are going to announce them two different ways . And please , when I raise my arm like that , some applause would be appreciated . </s>
So , while the votes are being tabulated I wan na talk with you , first of all thank your debaters for a very , very spirited evening . </s>

This debate will take place here once again at Rockefeller University’s Caspary Auditorium .

After the debate , 45 percent of you are for the motion , 46 percent are against , and 9 percent are undecided , the side for the motion wins… Congratulations to all of them and of course , to the art of persuasion itself , for me , John Donvan , and intelligence Squared , thank you .

Well , there’s an undecided as well . Undecided I have as 7 . Are we gon na put a slide up ‘cause this’ll— All right , let me just read the numbers to you , it’s a lot of numbers . </s>
Women in the audience before the debate , I’ll read it to you this way , before the debate , women in the audience voted 25 percent for the motion , after the debate , they voted 58 percent for the motion . Women in the audience before the debate voted 41 percent against the motion , and after the debate , 34 percent against the motion . </s>

Thank you for your patience , for the calculators in your heads , for our debaters , thank you very much for this evening . null I’d like to introduce at this point , uh , the person who , who really , uh…makes these , these debates possible . </s>
And that’s Robert Rosenkranz who’s chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation , sponsor of the evening’s debate . And Bob is gon na make some opening remarks . And I’m hearing some— Well , thank—thank you , Robert , very much , …with me tonight is Dana Wolfe , our executive producer , and I’d like to just extend a very warm welcome to all of you , at this , the opening debate of our second series . </s>
Intelligence Squared was formed with the goal of raising the level of public discourse in America . The concept is to frame a provocative proposition on a hot-button topic . The panel of experts attempts to convince us to vote , either for or against the proposition . The audience votes before hearing the debate , participates during a question period and then decides who has carried the day with their final vote . The response to this format has been really wonderful . </s>
Every one of our debates has sold out . Uh , we’re produced for radio by WNYC and carried on , uh , 70 National Public Radio stations around the country . And tonight’s proceedings , uh , will be aired on public television as well , on Channel 13 WNET here in—in New York . Well , American foreign policy has often been energized by a sense of moral conviction . </s>
Most of us have a strong conviction in the merits of the system that includes freedom of speech , free exercise of religion , rule of law , respect for property rights , and an elaborate balancing of power between the , uh , various branches of government . Uh…this is perhaps , uh , are the elements of what Fareed Zakaria has called liberal democracy . And they may be the elements we have in mind when we seek to encourage democracy in other nations . But our founders were as fearful of the tyranny of the mob as they were of the tyranny of the king . They constructed a Constitution that requires far more than a simple majority at a single moment in time to subvert these liberal elements . </s>
When democracy means simply the use of a ballot box to choose a leader , the merits become far more problematic . </s>
And that’s the subject of tonight’s debate . Should the US encourage democracy in countries where the best- organized and most politically powerful groups are Islamic radicals ? How should we react to an elected Hamas ? </s>
What do we make of polls that show that 65 % of Middle Easterners do not believe that spreading democracy is a real US objective ? On the other hand , if the US does not encourage democratic ideas , are we merely cynical supporters of despotic regimes and narrow elites ? </s>
Do we ignore the large , uh , majority of Muslims that believe that democracy will work in their countries ? Can such an approach galvanize , uh , domestic support . And if not , can we prudently , uh , take a hands-off approach to a region of the world that is so— of such enormous geopolitical significance . </s>
Well these are vexing questions indeed and present a real conundrum for US policy . But fortunately we have a distinguished panel of experts to turn to this evening . </s>
Our moderator , Robert Siegel , is the senior host of National Public Radio’s award-winning program “All Things Considered , ” and is the radio host of the Intelligence Squared series . </s>
He got started in radio broadcasting when he was a college freshman , in 1964 , and he’s still at it . He’s reported from Europe , the Middle East , and across the US , and for four years , directed NPR’s news and information department . </s>
Welcome back , Robert . I’d like to welcome you to this , the first debate of the second series of the Intelligence Squared US debates , tonight’s motion is , “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea.” I’m gon na give you a brief rundown of what will happen this evening , first , the proposer of the motion will start by presenting that side of the argument , and the opposition will follow , and each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we’ll go back and forth , from one side to the other . Second , when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks , I’ll open up the floor to brief questions from the audience . Third , when the question-and- answer is complete , each debater will make a final statement , no more than two minutes per person . </s>
Fourth , after the final closing statement is made , you will vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad that’s attached to the arm-rest of your seat . And fifth and last , I will announce the results of the audience vote , and I’ll tell you which side carried the day . Now , before hearing from our panelists , I’d like to start with a pre-debate vote . And I’d like you to pick up the keypad that’s attached to the , uh , arm-rest on your left . For audience members who are sitting on the aisle to my right , uh , your keypad is attached to the arm-rest on your right side next to your neighbor’s . </s>
And when I tell you , after my prompt , you will press “1 , ” to vote for the motion , “2” to vote against the motion , and “3” if you’re undecided , I’m gon na repeat the—the motion , which is that “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea.” “1” is for , “2” is against , “3” is undecided , and you may begin voting now . I hope you’ve been able to vote by now , I will reveal the results of the pre-debate vote later in the evening , but now though I’d like to introduce our panel . Starting with those who will speak for the motion , a senior fellow at the New America Foundation , former director for Middle East Affairs at the National Security Council , Flynt Leverett . The the founding president of the Nixon Center and publisher of its foreign-policy magazine The National Interest , Dimitri Simes . </s>
Uh , the Anwar Sadat Professor for Peace and Development at the University of Maryland , and also a non-resident senior fellow at the Saban Center of the Brookings Institution , Shibley Telhami . </s>
And now , the side against the motion , former Near Eastern Affairs Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary , and Coordinator for Broader Middle East Initiatives at the US Department of State , Liz Cheney . </s>
Vice-President for Foreign and Defense Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute , Danielle Pletka . And the director of the Adelson Institute for Strategic Studies at the Shalem Center in Jerusalem , Natan Sharansky . </s>
Let’s start a debate . Flynt Leverett . Good evening . It’s a pleasure to kick off tonight’s debate . </s>
I’m gon na start by telling you a couple of things that my colleagues and I are not arguing , in our support for tonight’s resolution . </s>
First , in arguing that spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea , my colleagues and I are not arguing that the people of the Middle East—whether defined as Arabs , Muslims , or in any other way—are inherently less capable of democratic development than any other ethnic , cultural or religious group . Second , we do not question the desirability of democracy , or the benefits of living under a democratic political order . I have the good fortune of being an American citizen solely through the accident of my birth . But my two colleagues tonight , came to this country from elsewhere , and embraced American citizenship by choice , precisely because they are convinced of democracy’s desirability . In arguing that spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea , my colleagues and I want to look at tonight’s resolution through the prism of American national interests . </s>
Of course US interests in the Middle East are complex and multifaceted , but I’m gon na boil down our most important interests in this critical region to three things . First , the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf , second , the security and welfare of the state of Israel , and third , keeping the Middle East from providing a platform for further mass-casualty terrorist attacks of the sort that we suffered on 9-11 . </s>
I will argue for tonight’s resolution because I believe that promoting democracy in the Middle East is not just not helpful for these interests , it is downright harmful to them . Let’s look first at terrorism . President Bush and his administration’s defenders have argued since the United States began preparing to invade Iraq , that spreading democracy in the Middle East is the essential antidote to jihadist terrorism originating in the region . But there is literally not a shred of hard evidence supporting that proposition . From Osama bin Laden on down , that claim that jihadist terrorists are products of economic and political marginalization is simply false . </s>
The 9-11 hijackers were truly trust-fund terrorists , from economically and politically advantaged backgrounds . Proponents of democracy promotion in the Middle East also argue , that democratization is needed to counteract the distorting effects of madrasa educations on the mind-set of millions of young Arabs and Muslims in the region . But the fact is that Al Qaeda and other internationally active terrorist groups , don’t recruit from madrasas . Look at it in practical terms . </s>
To be an internationally active jihadist terrorist , you need , for example , English language skills , you need a certain level of technical competence . Madrasas are not the place where one acquires that kind of skill-set . That’s why Al Qaeda and other internationally active jihadist terrorist groups recruit primarily among university students and university graduates . Indeed if you look at the backgrounds of terrorists who have been recruited over the years by Al Qaeda , you find the number-one subject that they studied at university was engineering , the number-two subject was medicine . Democracy promotion is not going to win the war on terror , in fact the Bush administration has tacitly acknowledged that promoting democracy is not winning the war on terror . </s>
Since 2005 , in the annual Patterns of Global Terrorism report , the administration has , as a matter of policy , withheld publishing the aggregate statistics showing the number of significant terrorist incidents around the world each year . </s>
They withhold that information , I would suggest , not because the data show that the number of incidents is getting less . It is actually getting greater -- democracy promotion will not help us win the war on terror . Now let’s turn to Israel’s place in the region . Proponents of democratization in the Middle East often advance what I call the garbage-collection model of lowering Palestinian and Arab expectations . This model assumes that Palestinians and their sympathizers in the Arab and Muslim worlds don’t really care that much about Palestinians living under occupation , that Palestinian and other Arab leaders use Israel as a convenient way to deflect popular attention from their own performance . </s>
I myself heard President Bush argue in the White House Situation Room , that a democratically-elected Palestinian government would be more focused on collecting garbage , and less , quote- unquote , “hung up” on territory and the status of Jerusalem . Well , we tested this theory in the 2006 Palestinian elections , and the result was Hamas’s victory in internationally supervised balloting in the West Bank and Gaza . </s>
The hard reality is that negotiating peace between Arab states and Israel is not popular in the Middle East . </s>
Arab-Israel peacemaking requires that Arab states—that , that the United States work with indigenous regimes in Arab states that are prepared to pursue peace with Israel , not because it is popular , but because those leaders judge it to be in their countries’ national interests . This is the approach that was pursued by Anwar Sadat in the Camp David accords . Sadat paid the ultimate price for that initiative . But it is the model that has been followed by his successor , President Mubarek , by King Hussein and his successor King Abdullah in Jordan . It is the model that is being followed today by Saudi King Abdullah in the Arab League Peace Initiative . </s>
Promoting democracy in the Middle East will not enhance the prospects for Arab-Israel peacemaking , it will in fact , harm prospects for peace . The same argument can also be extended to eliciting the absolutely essential cooperation of regional regimes , to enable the United States to play its critical role as the guarantor of physical security for Persian Gulf oil fields . </s>
The legacy of 20th century colonialism in the Middle East , oil concessions , and all the rest , mean that it is not popular for regional regimes to cooperate with hegemonic power . While there is no evidence that democracy reduces the incidence of terrorism , there is ample evidence—from places like Egypt and Saudi Arabia—that holding more open elections in these and other societies would produce governments that are more anti-American than incumbent regimes . Given this reality , how is it in America’s interest to rush these countries’ populations into voting booths ? A couple of final points . Advocate of democracy promotion in the Middle East , oftentimes argue that— </s>
One . —by promoting democracy , we are also promoting the spread of liberal values , the emancipation of women , um…and other things that Americans hold right and dear . </s>
And…they often suggest that , if we are not engaged in promoting this kind of agenda , we really are—to use Mr. Rosenkranz’s phrase—cynical supporters of despotic regimes . But , if you look at popular attitudes in the Arab and Muslim world , these attitudes are not just increasingly anti-American in their orientation toward international issues . They are less reformist on internal issues than many incumbent regimes . </s>
The best hope for modernization and ultimately liberalization , in the Arab and Muslim worlds today , lies in incumbent regimes who recognize that , first of all— </s>
Thank you— —economic modernization is essential to their country’s future . Thank you , Flynt Leverett , speaking for the motion . Uh… Danielle Pletka , against the motion . </s>
Good evening , everybody . You saw me looking around in a little bit of a panic and that’s because I realized I left my glasses in the other room . So I’m just going to hold this a little bit further forward , if you’ll forgive me . Before anything else , let us all agree that democracy is a good , in and of itself . It doesn’t require a wit as sharp as Winston Churchill’s to know that , stacked up against dictatorship , mob rule or even benevolent tyranny , democracy – notwithstanding all of its imperfections , is the best system of government . </s>
Let’s also accept that democracy means a great deal more than elections and that when we say democracy we’re really using a shorthand for a system that contemplates representative leadership , rule of law , economic as well as political freedoms and more . Finally , let’s stipulate that while we expect our news to arrive instantaneously , our paychecks to be deposited immediately and our diets to work miraculously , democracy is indeed a long term project . I’m pleased to see that Flynt , Shibley…Shibley , uh , Dimitri , uh , have accepted the idea that the system of government most admired in the Middle East is democratic and that they agree that people do indeed aspire to freedom in that region . And I must say I agree with the caveat that people do not aspire to freedom that is eclipsed by fear for the future and for their own security and well being . </s>
So we have a moral good that we are all agreed upon in the abstract . What we don’t agree about is the strategic imperative or the appropriate role of the United States . We can debate about that a little bit later but the foundation of that debate should be a proper understanding of the nexus between tyranny and terrorism . </s>
How do groups like Al Qaeda operate ? </s>
It should be clear by now that in parasitic fashion these groups feed off of host nations that are weak . They operate with a key , with a core group who are committed ideologues and do come from all walks of life . But the real sustenance , but that is , that is only part of the story . The real sustenance for Al Qaeda and other light groups is an environment that tolerates their methods in appreciation of their supposed ideals . </s>
For many it is not necessarily the virgins that await or the triumphs of the return of the Caliphate . Rather , it is the relief from the life in purgatory that constitutes the average lot of the average Arab . </s>
That life is about unemployment , real rates of up to thirty-five and forty per cent – and young men , who when polled consistently complain that their existence offers no hope and no opportunity . </s>
It is about the fact that the United Nations development program estimates that nine per cent of every business deal in the Middle East goes for bribes and when students who want to vote step into the streets of Cairo they risk arrest and torture , like Karim Suleiman , who was sodomized and tortured because he demonstrated in favor of the rule of law . These victims of Middle Eastern oppression are the ones who provide the oxygen that enables Al Qaeda to operate and it gives resonance to their political messages . And why ? </s>
If your life and your father’s life and your son’s life is lived under the yoke between this or dictator for life that , you can not form a new political organization and you can not change your system of government and you can not begin to help yourself and you look for other options . </s>
And if the only haven in which you can talk about those options is in the mosque and the only thing the mosque is offering up is Islamic purity , a return to greatness and the uncorrupted life of the true believer , it shouldn’t be a great wonder that such ideas take hold . If you find that argument unpersuasive let’s for a moment look from our opponent’s viewpoint . They rightly suggest that in Egypt , Jordan , Syria , Lebanon , Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Palestine – I could go on – the main opposition parties are Islamist . </s>
But why ? It’s because they have a proven record of delivering on a better life ? Is it because somehow they have more charisma than other opponents of the regime ? </s>
Or is the fact that the Islamists have successfully used the vast religious networks and cash available to them to promote their own political cause – occupying the only political space that exists in the authoritarian Arab world . There are only two places for breathing room in the current Middle Eastern political construct -- the dictator space and the Islamists . Oppression gives the Islamists the popularity to move their agenda and further the environment in which Al Qaeda is tolerated and worse . </s>
And they know it . In extensive writings , including by Bin Laden and Zarqawi -- and here I really disagree with what Flynt had to say – they rail against democracy because they know it represents a threat to their lifeline . Zarqawi wrote to Ayman al-Zawahiri bemoaning the future of their fight in Iraq . Democracy is coming , he wrote , and there will be no excuse thereafter . </s>
So what is the answer ? </s>
The answer can not be that because Hamas and others take advantage of the democratic process , therefore , democracy is discredited . We must confront systems that tolerate Islamists and provide ideological safe haven to Al Qaeda . </s>
And the way to do that is by insuring that there are other opposition parties , genuine reformers , who have the power and the money to make their voices heard . </s>
Our opponents will argue that the United States has no role to play , that where we interfere we make things worse and that with our inconsistency we risk destabilizing the region . That is an unacceptable formulation . </s>
It is certainly true that the United States is not a fault free advocate for democracy . I can now agree that there are times when the reality of foreign policy demands that we do business with objectionable leaders . But there is no reason to rely on the brutality of dictators because that brutality at the end only besmirches us . Worse still , there is clear evidence that Jihadists flourish where dictators rule . In supporting the PLO , what did we do to rid Gaza and the West Bank of Hamas in supporting Mubarak ? </s>
What have we done to rid Egypt of the Muslim Brotherhood ? Sixty years of rooting for the dictator’s stability , as my colleague Liz Cheney will make clear , didn’t protect us on 9/11 . </s>
Our role must be to facilitate and educate , to hold open the door for democrats like Ayman Nour in Egypt . It should be to use our influence to see laws rescinded to stop the formation of new parties and constrain the grass roots activities of political and economic reformers . </s>
It should be to insure that mosques are not the only place where political parties and reformers can meet and it should be to insure that economic reforms go hand in hand with political change . Ultimately , when young men can expect unemployment in a thriving market economy , there will still be a few who are attracted to Al Qaeda – those medical students and those engineers . But the vast mass will not . They will be less attracted to the answers they hear from radical preachers . </s>
One . </s>
Or do our opponents here this evening really believe that reform is not possible , that reformers do not exist ? No one among us has suggested the only way to prize open the closed doors of the Middle Eastern palaces is with Middle Eastern…is with Middle East – excuse me – military force . To the contrary – if that is our system it will fail . The same holds true for Al Qaeda . </s>
We can not kill every Pakistani that tolerates an Al Qaeda operative in his midst . </s>
We can not bomb houses of worship that preach Islamic politics and jihad . We can throw our considerable weight behind the people who do believe that rule of democracy – not jihad and bin Laden – offer real hope for the future . We may never do it perfectly but that is certainly not a reason not to do it at all . </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you . Thank you , Danielle Pletka , speaking against the motion . Shibley Telhami , for the motion . Good evening . </s>
I think , uh , America should stand up for democracy and freedom . I think it should be an inspiring model , as it has been historically . </s>
What we should n't be doing is trying to pretend like we’re capable of making spreading democracy a top priority in a world in which we face many threats – and certainly not to do it by force . I think , if you look at what has happened over the past five years as a consequence of this policy of spreading democracy by force , is that we have a public and Arab world that doesn’t believe us : we have a gov…governments that don’t believe us : we have less democracy , more anarchy , more instability , more terrorism – and even worse , the growing American dependence on the very institutions and the very…very governments that need to be reformed . </s>
In essence , we have given democracy a bad name . It is hard for people in the region , including people who badly and desperately are looking for democracy and freedom , to think of democracy and freedom the American way without thinking about the horrors of Iraq . We have paid a price by diverting attention from the important issue of human rights , which we often confuse with spreading democratic systems . </s>
That issue which we should trump and advocate has paid a price as a consequence of this policy . Let me begin with some of the facts . </s>
The vast majority of people in the Arab world , all polls show , do not believe that we mean to spread democracy in the Middle East . Most of them believe that we’re in Iraq and in the region for oil , Israel and weakening the Muslim world . Even the governments who have faced pressures from us – and yes , they have faced pressures and , yes , they have been told to liberalize – all have believed that this is essentially tactical , that this is done in order to coerce them to cooperate on strategic issue or as a political domestic issue to divert attention from the absence of wea…uh , the weapons of mass destruction in Iraq . </s>
And as a consequence , they dealt with it tactically . </s>
They said , The President needs a little political – give him a little election so he can say , I’ve got more democracy in Libya , I’ve got more democracy in , in Saudi Arabia . </s>
And then once he claims that he has a success -- he’s not gon na claim it as a failure the next day - - and then you can go on with business . And look at the reality that we have at the moment . The vast majority of people in the Middle East – when you poll them – those people whom we’re supposed to be giving democracy to -- uh , the vast majority believe that the Middle East is less democratic today than it was before the Iraq War – less dramatic today than it was before Iraq War . And it was horribly undemocratic before the Iraq War , no doubt . </s>
And how is that the case ? Is this simply made up by the media ? Is this what people tell them ? Is this what leaders tell them ? </s>
I’m afraid there’s a little bit of reality to that and we now see it in many of the places that we celebrated early on as examples of democracy . Remember , the three big examples – Iraq , Lebanon and the Palestinian areas -- and you look at where we are in these areas . But separate from that there was some other dynamic that goes on that we are not coming to grips with – something that our policy does because in , in reality we are not making democracy our priority . And we , in essence , deceive ourselves when we think we are . </s>
Let me give you an example . Ninety per cent of the Arab public passionately opposed the Iraq War , didn’t want to see it take place . They told the governments , Don’t do it . It’s gon na bring about ruins . </s>
Their government’s instinct was , Don’t support the Iraq War . But when we went to the Iraq War -- these governments are certainly dependent on the U.S. -- in the end they came along and they provided logistical support and bases and everything else . And they were telling us that they’re worried about their public opinion . Well , we had , it was more important for us that they support our policies on terrorism , on Iraq , on the Arab/Israeli issue , despite the anger of the people , than the liberalization . What happens in the process ? </s>
How is the Jordanian government or the Egyptian government or the Saudi government going to face up with that pressure that comes from the public at a time of war ? </s>
What they do is they unleash security services . Yes , they have elections -- and by the way , some of those elections we’ve had as little as twenty per cent and possibly only ten per cent of the public participating . It tells you how people , how seriously people took it . </s>
But in the end these governments became more repressive in order to quell , to , to , to put down any possible opposition , given the anger of the public . </s>
And this is essentially what we do , even in the war on terrorism . Who do we think our most important allies in these , uh , countries -- It’s not the Democrats . Yes , the Democrats we theoretically want to empower them . But who do we give most aid to ? </s>
With whom do we institutionally cooperate – the security services who are embedded with our security services , the military , which are in bed with our military ? These are the institutions of the repressions that need to be reformed . But those are the ones we have to deal with . And I’m not saying we don’t need to deal with them . We have to deal with them . </s>
But the reality of it is that the consequence is perpetuating repression , increasing it even as we pretend to be promoting it . Let me , just a couple of , make a couple of points to end . One is that I believe that all people in the world and all Arabs and all Muslims want to see freedom and democracy . No one likes dictatorship . And yes , you , I don’t think they want a different kind of democracy and freedom . </s>
When I ask them , uh , Name two countries where there’s most freedom and democracy for their people they name primarily Western countries – Western Europeans and the U.S . They know what democracy and freedom are . People aspire to it . </s>
But one thing they don’t want is they don’t want anarchy . They want anarchy even less than they democracy . And they want to see no occupation . </s>
They want freedom but they want to avoid anarchy and they want to avoid occupation . </s>
And when they see what is going on in Iraq , if a leader in Egypt looks at their citizen and say , Do you want Cairo or do you want Baghdad ? I want Cairo over Baghdad any day of the week , with all the pain that people face every day . </s>
And that is the reality of how the choices are seen in the region . Let me end by saying I am not in harmony with the view that we – One . …shouldn’t advocate democracy . </s>
I think we need to advocate democracy . But I believe that there is a better way . </s>
I think we should focus on those issues over which there is international consensus , like human rights . We should hold people responsible to treaties that they have signed and in order for us to be powerful in that regard we have to uphold our end of the bargain . We have to be an inspiring model , not just lecture to people while we have the Abu Ghraib prison . And we need to work in economic reform because that is the structure that enables true democracy to emerge from within . We’re treating Arab as a passive people that , that need to be told from the outside . </s>
No , they need empowerment from the outside – not manipulation . Thank you very much . Thank you , Shibley Telhami , uh , speaking for the motion . </s>
Liz Cheney , against the motion . Uh , there are clearly a number of issues that our opponents would like to debate tonight . And I , too , would welcome those debates . I would readily accept a debate on the topic , `` Was it Right for America to Go to War in Iraq ? '' </s>
I would readily accept a debate on the topic , `` Is America Effectively Promoting Democracy in the Middle East ? '' Or perhaps one on , `` How Accurate Are Opinion Polls in the Middle East ? '' And I hope Intelligence Squared invites me back if they’re gon na have those debates . But those are not the issues before us tonight . Although I can understand why our opponents would rather discuss those issues than have to stand before you and argue against democracy . </s>
But make no mistake , their protestations aside , that is what they’re doing . </s>
The truth is that spreading democracy in the Middle East is not a bad idea nor is it a failed idea . Nor is it an idea that would have been good except that George W. Bush adopted it . It is , by any objective measure , a good idea , the right idea and a necessary policy choice for America today . Here are some facts : America is at war with an enemy driven by radical , ideological hatred to destroy us and all that we stand for . These terrorists were not created by U.S. policy . </s>
They are religious zealots who will stop at nothing in achieving their objective of establishing a global Caliphate in which individual lives have no value , women are chattel and the only legitimate faith is a perverted version of Islam . To accomplish their objectives , the terrorists or the trust fund terrorists – as my colleague Flynt has called them -- need recruits . Because the truth about the trust fund terrorists is they don’t do the dirty work themselves . </s>
They’ve got to find young men and women willing to strap bombs onto their bodies , detonate them , killing themselves and taking as many innocents with them as possible . For decades the terrorists have known that they can prey most effectively in societies where young people live in despair , where they have no hope for a better future here on earth – in societies that are characterized by brittle , autocratic regimes and closed status economic systems . For too many years America perpetuated this status quo . We supported those authoritarian regimes , we ignored the aspirations of their people . This policy , essentially the one that our opponents would have us return to tonight , brought only a false sense of security and stability . </s>
It is true that young people in the Arab world , as elsewhere , yearn for the freedom to be heard . </s>
They yearn to stand for something larger than self . They yearn to control their own destinies and choose their own leaders – and only democracy can fulfill those aspirations . Our opponents argue there is no evidence that democracy combats terror . To make this argument , you have to ignore the words of the terrorists themselves . If you read the captured letters of former Al Qaeda and Iraq Chief , Abu Musab al-Zarqawi -- who my colleague Dani Pletka quoted – you will see , in 2005 he wrote , quote : We have declared a bitter war against the principle of democracy and all those who seek to embrace it . </s>
The terrorists have done this because they know the fundamental truth – that people never choose to ru…be ruled by Al Qaeda or the Taliban . </s>
Those are the ideologies that must be imposed by force . Our opponents tonight also argue that supporting democracy is messy and that elections do not always turn out the way we would like them to . That is certainly true here in America , as well . But that is essentially an argument about how to effectively promote democracy , not one about whether promoting democracy is a bad idea . </s>
So let’s dispense with some straw men and agree on several things . Promoting democracy is not only about supporting elections . Elections are necessary but not sufficient and often they should come last in the reform process , not first . America’s democracy policy should and does include supporting freedom of speech , freedom of the press , freedom of religion , women’s rights and a thriving civil society . </s>
Asserting , as our opponents do , that somehow promoting democracy in the Middle East is an imperial imposition of American values requires ignoring two critical facts . The first is you have to ignore that the desire for freedom is a universal human desire . At its base this is an assertion , regardless of what they say , that only some people – maybe those of us fortunate enough to be born in the West – really desire human freedom . At least fifty per cent of our panel tonight is living evidence that that claim is not defensible . Our opponents’ position also requires ignoring the massive change underway in the Middle East today . </s>
Five or six years ago state dominated media , state press dominated the media in the region . Today there’s been an explosion of independent newspapers , television programming and access to the internet . Six years ago no woman had ever run for or voted in an election in the Gulf . </s>
Today they’ve done both . Six years ago a demo…and discussion about democracy in the Arab world would have brought ridicule and potentially jail time . </s>
Today leaders , reformers , journalists and millions of others are engaged in a constant ongoing debate and discussion about democracy . And America’s actions in this regard matter . As an Egyptian reformer said recently , When the outside world softens its call for reform regimes are emboldened to ignore their citizens’ rights . Knowing that we are on the side of those fighting for freedom empowers them and it strengthens them . Abandoning them or this cause would be unjust and unwise . </s>
In that regard , our opponents tonight need to answer this question : If you are truly concerned about America’s credibility and image in the Middle East , why are you willing to accept the grave damage that will be done to that credibility if America adopts your approach , if we return to the policy of support for autocrats and turn our backs on the aspirations of the , uh , Arab people ? Finally , consider this : As we engage in this debate here tonight in Manhattan , a Saudi woman can sit in her home sixty-five miles , fifty-five hundred miles away . </s>
She can blog about her life , her fears , her oppression , her hopes and her aspirations . She can post that on the internet for all the world to read . </s>
She has a voice , probably for the first time in her life . If we were to tune in right now to any of the scores of Arabic satellite channels we would find young men and women from across the region debating the issues of the day , arguing and questioning authority . Adopting the path proposed by our opponents would be to betray those young men and women . Would our opponents have us tell young Arab men and women that America doesn’t believe they’re ready for democracy ? </s>
Would they have us say to women across the Gulf that although they have been able , over the last few years , to vote and run – One . ..for office , that was just temporary and America has now decided we won’t support their efforts any longer . Would they have us assert that we , in our ultimate wisdom , have decided that instead of supporting freedom fighters , we will throw America’s great and unparalleled strength behind autocrats and against the people ? </s>
That surely is a world in which the terrorists have won . That is a world in which neither the terrorists nor the Americans support democracy and that is not a world in which I imagine many of us would like to live . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Liz Cheney , uh , speaking against the motion . Dimitri Simes , for the motion . This was an interesting presentation . I never knew that I believed in all those things . But it’s always , you know , a learning experience , uh , particularly when you debate Bush Administration officials or many former administration officials . </s>
Your kind of plan , what you mean , what you sought and what you said . I don’t think that this was our position and I hope that you will make your own judgment , whether the previous presentation really reflected our side 's . How can one be against democracy promotion ? A very prominent American leader once said , It is our destiny to promote democracy worldwide because we can not yield moral ground to repressive regimes because it would be unjust and wrong and because , also , it could be never secure as long as there are repressive regimes . </s>
Because they would not leave us alone and would continue to plot against us . Sorry , France , it was not a prominent American . It was Leon Trotsky . And of course , he spoke not about promoting democracy but promoting proletarian revolutions . </s>
But he believed in proletarian revolutions very strongly . </s>
He was a sincere man . So were many Crusaders when they invaded the Middle East and you remember what has happened and what did it cost – to the Arabs , to the Christians , to the regions . Uh , we are not talking about our private beliefs . We are entitled to our beliefs . </s>
But democracy is not a religion . Democracy promotion should be policy . Therefore I will not hesitate to say that there are some things that are more important than democracy . </s>
If , uh , and then in 1930s , we knew what Hitler would do to the Jews and to the others , would we allow him to come to power democratically ? </s>
Wouldn’t we consider stopping him a wise and honorable policy ? And I completely agree with the Israelis now when they would not want to recognize democratically elected Hamas . And I do not care how many votes Hezbollah gets , but as long as they do what they do we should judge them not by the process to which they came to power , but what they’re doing to themselves , to others and what they present to the United States . I would yield to no one in my commitment to freedom . Freedom - - to select democracy for us and to freedom to allow others to make their own choices . </s>
I am touched by anecdotes about Arab women . I don’t need anecdotes when I hear about two and a half million Iraqi refugees – two and a half million , for whom in the name of democracy promotion we are doing almost exactly nothing . And more than a hundred thousand civilians who have died so far in Iraq and more dying . And our democracy promo…promoters don’t seem to be extremely concerned . </s>
There was a very prominent American who said , in 1964 , that extremism in defense of freedom is no vice . </s>
His name was Barry Goldwater . I disagree . Extremism in the name of whatever is never a virtue . And extremism is never a sound policy . First about democracy as something that stop…stops wars – remember , the Peloponnesian War among the Greeks . </s>
More than twenty-five hundred centuries ago and there were democracies on both sides . Now , I just came from Washington . Who , uh , do you think burned Washington in 1812 ? </s>
My impression is that this was the British . </s>
And of course , they had a monarchy but they were very democratic by standards of the time . Now , more Americans have died in the Civil War than in any other war in American history . Would you disagree that the Confederacy was democratic – at least by the standard of the time ? And what about the British in South Africa , fighting each other at the end of the 19th Century . </s>
Democracies do go to war against each other . Now , about democracy and terrorism – well , you know , I think that one of the most democratic countries I know is called Britain . And you see British born citizens engaging in the most vicious terror against their country . Well , you would say , but this may be terror imported . Well , about , what about the Basques in Spain ? </s>
What about IRA and their long war against Britain ? What about the Oklahoma City bomber ? Come on , we know very well that there are many causes of terror . And to say that the absence of democracy in Saudi Arabia and Egypt really is responsible for September 11th -- you know , a claim like that has no scientific evidence whatsoever , is not based on interviews with the terrorists themselves . No senior CIA official who knows how these suspects were interviewed and what they said would ever claim that these people have attacked the United States because their Arab regimes were not democratic . </s>
People love freedom , I completely agree with that . But , you know , when people love freedom they may not only that they would be able to vote or even to enjoy free press or even , uh , freedom of religion or even that they would be able to travel . You know what they also mean ? </s>
They mean that they want to be able to make their own choices , including to make their own mistakes . And that’s what the American Revolution was all about . And when the only remaining super power is coming to other countries and uses considerable American leverage and sometimes American military power telling them , Follow our indispensable guidance or else pay the price , then some people are unhappy . And people who are unhappy , are not just despots— </s>
One . </s>
—and they’re not just some brainwashed people . India is the greatest democracy , in terms of numbers of people in India , and by now they have a long experience with democracy . </s>
And yet India is very strongly against democracy promotion . We should believe in democracy for ourselves , we should promote freedom of choice for others , but we should not presume that we know all the answers , and as the only remaining superpower , we should be the judge and the jury , however noble our intentions may be . Thank you , Dimitri Simes , speaking for the motion . Natan Sharansky , against the motion . </s>
You know , in life…a disadvantage can sometimes be advantage . Take being short . I can assure that in Soviet prison , being short was a huge advantage . And not only because punishment cells were very small . But because…the food is rationed . </s>
And clothes come in one size . So for tall people , they’re always hungry , and clothes simply doesn’t cover their body , and protect them from cold . But for people of my size , it was easier with hunger , and I always had an extra cloth , to cover myself , from the cold . And the winters are very cold in gulag . </s>
There we were praying for global warming . So…one can think that…living under totalitarian regime was a big disadvantage . Of course I’m very happy that my daughters were born in freedom . </s>
But , sometimes I really think , that having experience of living in a fear society , I have a big advantage . Because , I will never take freedom for granted . </s>
I will never think that the grass on the other side could be greener . I will never say what was said by one human rights , so-called human rights officer of the United Nations two years ago in Baghdad , when he was explaining why under Saddam Hussein it was better . He said , you know , under Saddam , if only you object , give away your freedom of thought and expression , you’re physically more or less okay . Now only the one who never had to give away his freedom of thought and expression can say such a thing . </s>
People who live in fear societies , have different perspective , of the advantages of democracy . And when they say democracy , exactly as all the colleagues who are against said , democracy’s not about elections . Stalin had elections . </s>
He did pretty well there . And Hitler not only had elections but as just now was said , he has opposition . He was elected democratically , but nobody would think that Third Reich is…a democracy . America’s strong democracy because , it has all these institutions of civil society , free press , independent courts , and so forth . </s>
Because…when I—when I’m speaking about democracy …the society which as I call , can pass the town square test -- you can come to the center of your city . You can speak your mind , you can express your opinions , and you won’t be punished , you will not be harassed . </s>
That’s free society . So , is promoting free institutions of free society , like , free press , or , or independent opposition , independent courts , is promotion of these institutions result us a better year ? Of course not . </s>
What , that’s , exactly what America was doing , when you defeated Germany , and Japan in the Second World War . You spent enormous efforts , economical , intellectual , financial , to support , to promote democracy , and today Japan and Germany is not a threat . Take Russia , when Russia was part of the totalitarian Soviet system , it was your worst enemy . When Soviet Union fell apart and Russia went towards freedom , it almost became your ally . </s>
Today , when freedom is then in retreat , in a big retreat , it becomes again a threat to America . And that is true about every part of the world . Take Venezuela , you take North Korea , you take Iran…what—whenever there is a threat to America is means that democracy is there , in retreat . If Middle East today is a dangerous place , it’s not because of democracy . It’s because in the last 60 years , when democracy was spread to Germany , and to Japan , and to Spain , and to Latin America , and to South Asia , and to Eastern Europe , and even to Russia , it was never spread to Middle East . </s>
And one can say , but you can not impose democracy freedom from outside , of course you can’t impose freedom from outside . But , we find out that you can impose dictatorship from outside , simply by supporting dictators . And that’s unfortunately exactly what so many leaders of the free world were doing . They were supporting and they continued to support , royal Saudis . Ignoring the fact what’s happening there with the rights of even . </s>
They supported and continue to support…uh , au—au— authoritarian regime of Egypt . Ignoring the fact that practically every week , there is another human rights activist sent to prison . They were supporting Saddam Hussein , until the last day . </s>
Day before Saddam Hussein sent troops to Kuwait , leaders of Europe and United States of America believed that he was a good reliable partner , who can get stability . Decades before American President started speaking about promoting the freedom of the Middle East , Al Qaeda was born , that was already the place plagued with wars , with killing , and with repression . Was Middle East safer , before America started talking about promoting democracy . What is— was it safer in the ‘70s , when Jordan had to fight PLO and Syria , when Lebanon was almost destroyed with civil war , when Iranian re—regime in— emerged , and the American diplomats turned into refugees . Was Middle East more safe in the ‘80s , when the American airplane was blown up by , uh , Libya . </s>
When in Beirut and hundreds of American soldiers were killed . When one million citizens became victims , killed and wounded , in the war between Iran and Iraq . Has the Middle East been more safe in ‘90s , when Kuwait was sw—swallowed up , by Iraq . When missiles were fired—falling on Tel Aviv and Riyadh . </s>
When twin towers survived…the first attack of the terrorists . And when Al Qaeda published its famous fatwa , about killing Americans . </s>
Promoting democracy in the Middle East is an excellent idea , by the way I , I idea that it has to be connected with human rights . That the policy of the free world has—in the Middle East has to be connected with the question of human rights , that’s exactly what I was promoting for all my years . </s>
Unfortunately , all the administrations of the United States of America in the ‘70s and the ‘80s and the ‘90s , never did it . Promoting democracy in the Middle East is an excellent idea , that’s very—the thing is , how . It’s very difficult to overcome the resistance of all those who don’t want democracy there . One . And that’s a very important question . </s>
But it’s not the question which we are discussing today , till this day the question which is discussed is , whether it is good idea or not . </s>
The march of freedom , ladies and gentlemen , is very difficult . It will not succeed in one day . But there is no alternative . </s>
Great struggles between those who on one side , those millions , hundreds of millions in the Middle East , who want freedom , and those who want to deprive them of freedom . The problem is that sometimes we forget on whose side we are . The globe was blessed , and I personally was blessed , with America for—which always knew on what side it is . America which knew that , this divide between free world and fear societies , is much more important than divide between Republicans and Democrats , between this and that party . America which knew that ideal freedom…is bigger than any president , any party , any country . </s>
Thank you , Natan Sharansky— Thank you . —speaking against the motion . </s>
Uh…we have heard the opening presentations by all six of our panelists , we now enter our question-and-answer session , folks will come to , uh , get a microphone near members of the audience who want to pose a question , I want to start by , uh , picking up on something that Natan Sharansky has said and have…uh , we’ll have Flynt Leverett or another member of this panel answer it . Uh , can one be an advocate for human rights or should one be an advocate for human rights , without at least implicitly criticizing the entire dictatorial structure of a government that might violate human rights , or ultimately , if we’re going to support anybody whose human rights are violated…should we not follow through and say , why not become more democratic while you’re at it . May—may—if I may , um , I’d like to answer this one . Um , you know , I—I think there are two big differences here . Uh , one difference is , that , when we are saying we’re spreading democracy or we’re shaping institutions a long ways , that we imagine ourselves but there is no consensus or international norms , that’s one thing . </s>
But when we are talking about human rights there , uh , there are human rights treaties , there are international laws , there are norms against torture . And many of these governments in the Middle East are signatories to these treaties . And therefore , it is a very different order of things , to hold them accountable to those treaties . </s>
And it is—and you would get a lot more international support rather than be exposed and be alone in pushing a policy that other people are not doing . And these governments can and must respond , particularly when the international pressure comes . </s>
So that’s one difference that is extremely important because we can mobilize supporter , we can strengthen institutions , we can do it , but the other difference is , is that we— There are two…uh , the difficulty in imposing democracy , is a , another order beyond— </s>
Mm-hmm . —uh , trying to uphold people on , on human rights because I want to say this on , on democracy because I think , we don’t have modesty here , it’s like saying , trust us , we can spread democracy . And we don’t have a good record . </s>
Even scholars don’t know how to do it . And yet we want to make it a priority , when in fact , we haven’t been able to do even lesser things very well . Shibley Telhami answered that question . Uh , are you satisfied with that , Natan Sharansky , that you can separate human rights out from a—a broader— No , I—I think— </s>
—political critique— </s>
I think that’s exactly the ways of more , more , more than relatives . That there is constant attempt to separate the question of human rights from the nature of societies . </s>
That , like some…organization of human rights say we are not make different mark— giving marks to regimes , we don’t say what regime is good and bad . And as a result , we can have one page about violations of human rights in Syria , and 100 pages of violations of human rights , about in America , and everyone says , well you see America is much worse . And I always say you know , have the same information , it’s very important to me that American will all be criticized for human rights . But rights authoritarian regimes , or totalitarian regimes and democratic regimes . </s>
And to be clear that , 100 pages about democratic regime is not the same as one line about authoritarian regime . Unfortunately , the of human rights was absolutely separated from the nature of the regimes themselves . Well , at—at this moment , uh , perhaps we’ll have some follow-up on this point , but I—I want to , uh , report to you how you voted before you heard from our debaters . On the motion , uh , that spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea , 46 % , uh , of you in the audience using your keypads voted for the motion . 36 % voted against the motion , and 18 % were undecided . </s>
So those were the pre-debate results , and we’ll vote again , a little bit later . Uh… Just on this—this point of human rights , uh , Flynt Leverett , did you , did you have something to add to—to your side ? Yeah—yeah , I just wanted to say , yes , it is possible to make that separation and it actually works in the real world . Um , one of the few things I did in my , um , service at the Bush White House of which I am unreservedly proud , is that I drafted the letter that President Bush sent to President Mubarek in 2002 regarding the detention of Saad Eddin Ibrahim , the , the scholar— </s>
Democracy advocate in— </s>
—yes— </s>
—in Egypt . Um , and basically the tack we took in that letter was , um , we were at that point discussing the possibility of , um , uh , additional aid to Israe—to Egypt beyond what Egypt was already receiving . And we simply said in the letter , you know , you’re doing this to Saad has made it impossible for us to move ahead with any kind of initiative like this . We also said in the letter , you know , existing aid and our strategic cooperation , you know , we hope will go on . Um , but we sent the— </s>
—but we sent the signal that you can’t get— </s>
That’s promoting democracy— —you can’t get more— Exactly—exactly— And— That’s promoting democracy— </s>
—we can’t get more— Sure . And— </s>
Sure . …in the end , Saad was released in pretty short order after that letter was sent because— But the offense that you were addressing , Flynt , was , he’s in jail , you weren’t saying , we want to adopt his reform agenda for democracy— No , we were saying we want him out of jail . Hmm . </s>
It’s a start— Can I respond on that , because I think that’s a— </s>
Liz Cheney . —that’s a—what , what Flynt has described is accurate , uh , and it is a key—a terrific example of how the US promotes democracy , it is one of the tools to use . Um , Saad Eddin was in jail because he’d been a threat to the regime , because he’d supposedly written an article about the succession in Egypt , he’d written things the regime did not appreciate . </s>
He was imprisoned , he was a prisoner of conscience . And at some point , from , from the perspective of US policy , it became unacceptable to us , and we , we said to the Mubarek regime we will no longer continue this level of aid , we will consider future levels of aid at risk— Though we will continue at a present level— Uh , if you—if you— Right , we will consider future levels of aid at risk if you go down this path , and potentially , in following years , additional amounts would be at risk . </s>
At the same it— Flynt , I was also there but let me finish , I gave you a chance . At the same time , we said to the government of Egypt , we’re gon na take part of the assistance that we are already giving you , and we are gon na set it aside from democracy promotion activities . And we are going to fund activities that you may or may not agree with us on , we are not gon na ask your approval every time we provide assistance to a women’s rights organization , or to a political organization . </s>
Uh , we are gon na be promoting democracy , we would rather do this hand in hand , we would rather find ways that we can work together , but it’s US taxpayers’ money and we wan na see it spent in the cause of freedom . So I think it’s important to , to note that this is just one example of the kinds of tools we use , um , to effectively help to support the spread of freedom . Danielle Pletka ? I think it’s also important and it’s a little bit unfair perhaps but it is important to bear a little bit of witness to what Saad Eddin Ibrahim has done since he was released , uh , from prison , uh , with the good offices of Flynt , Liz , and , and other folks in the Bush administration , and that is that he has been an untiring and , extraordinarily annoying to the Mubarek regime , voice for change— </s>
Reform— —for reform , and he said to the President of the United States in the presence of Natan and others at a recent conference in Prague , why do you not do more . Why do you not stand up for us . </s>
Now , that’s not the three of us or the three of you . That is a reformer in the Middle East who’s calling upon us to use our power . And I think that that is what we need to reflect , those voices— Dimitri Simes . </s>
You know— When I hear this argument , that we should criticize every government , uh , we disagreement with in terms of their domestic practices , I want to ask people in the audience before the vote , to ask themselves…when was the last time you assaulted , even if for rhetorically , your business partners . </s>
When if you are a lawyer , when was the last time you told a judge that he was a jerk . </s>
Uh , when you came to school where your children study , and there told the principal that you have no confidence in them . You know what…if you have to work with people , not because you appointed them , not because you selected them , but because you need to work with them , you have to know when to stop . You don’t need to praise them artificially . </s>
You do not need to pretend like President Bush did , that , uh , President Putin had a wonderful pro-democracy soul . But , you do understand that if you need Egypt , if you need the Saudis , to help you with the Middle East peace process , to create an impression that we are trying to overthrow their governments , well , you know , it’s a little inconsistent . </s>
It is counterproductive . And I think like with every good thing , we need to know when to stop . </s>
And the Bush administration did not know , and still does not know when to stop . I need to say one thing in response to that though , and I know Natan wants to answer too . 9-11 changed that . And after September 11th , we were very clearly in a situation where it wasn’t us talking to our children’s teacher . It was us saying to governments in the region , conditions inside your countries have become a national security challenge , threat , concern for us . </s>
It’s not us saying that we are going to…impose democracy , saying that we’re going to invade every country in the Middle East as are some of the straw men that are , that are held up , but much more us saying , look , we are threatened by the conditions in your country . We are threatened as a nation because your children are living in despair , because your children have no hope , because they can’t speak , because they go to schools where they’re teaching hatred , and violence and intolerance . Those things are not sort of your concerns which have no impact on us , and anybody who lived through 9-11 has thought about the fact that that danger came here to our shores , primarily from countries in that region which are not allowing freedom for their people . You have to understand that their freedom is not just right but it’s a national security interest for the United States— Shib—Shibley Telhami has the last word of this exchange— </s>
What Liz has just said is actually rather revealing , because I think that’s an argument about , uh , not democracy as an end in itself but as an instrument to en—to American security , it’s a— it’s a— It’s both . </s>
It’s absolutely both— Well—you , you know , you can’t have it both ways , and I think if this is the tack that was taken , uh , this is part of the problem , you have to make an evaluation , has it served our security , even if you don’t make a judgment about democracy , uh , in the same way that we did have a— I think many people in the American political mainstream came to believe that , somehow terrorism is a function of the absence of democracy . First of all , scho—scholars don’t agree on that necessary . But , but , let’s assume that that was the case . Then you have to make an assessment whether we have more terrorism or less terrorism , as a consequence of the policy that we have undertaken , and I think , everybody could look now and make an assessment on where we are in the Middle East , there’s more— There’s no doubt , that there is more Al Qaeda in the Middle East than there was before , in our world certainly , and , there is more terrorism in the Middle East than before . </s>
So it hasn’t worked with our national security , and it is being in a way , argued both as an end in itself and an instrument of security , when in fact , even the scholars who believe it’s possible to do it , believe it’ll take years to do and then meanwhile , all you have is instability . And what instability is correlated with , is more terrorism . And that is why we can’t have it both ways , so when Hamas gets elected , uh , you’re stuck . You don’t know what to do . </s>
That’s the problem . </s>
Natan Sharansky’s gon na make a liar of me and insist on— Yeah , I—I want only— —having the last word— </s>
No , I want only to , to react to the jokes of Mr. Simes because they sounded for me like kind of déjà vu . And I understood why . Because they are exactly those arguments of those who explained to us why Soviet Union should not be called Evil Empire . Why Soviet Union should not be restricted in it trade with the United States . Why should not be massive demonstrations for Soviet Jews when Soviet officials are coming . </s>
If these jokes were heard then and there you were very strong . If they would listen to them , I would still be in prison . </s>
Well , you know— Is there—no , is there a question for— When I came to the United States , one of the first things , uh , I did , was , uh , to become a secretary of the advisory board of the Union of Councils for Soviet Jews . And I was a strong supporter of the Jackson-Vanik amendment . So— </s>
There is absolutely no contradiction , between , uh…helping people like Mr. Sharansky , who is a genuine hero , and whose courage I greatly admire , and also understanding some practical interests . Ronald Reagan called the Soviet Union an Evil Empire . </s>
Ronald Reagan also , immediately after his assassination , uh , wrote a handwritten letter to Leonid Brezhnev , suggesting that they should find a way to work together . </s>
You need to find the balance . The Bush administration doesn’t know how to do it . </s>
Now , we have a question— We have a question from the audience on the , on the aisle , sir . And , may I say that , uh… please , ask your questions after someone has arrived with a microphone , if you are a member of the press , uh , please identify yourself . Uh , if you’re not a member of the press you—you have privacy rights . </s>
What if you wan na be a member of the press . If you’re an aspiring member of the press you may also identify yourself— My name is Arthur Schiff , my question is , uh , this , what is the moral responsibility of the United States , to that fraction of the population in oppressed countries , and specifically for example the people we left behind in Vietnam and the people we left behind in Iraq in ’91— What is the moral responsibility of the US to those people who advocate , care about , are willing to sacrifice themselves , endanger their lives , because they are committed to democracy , and irrespective of everything else see the US as that bastion of democratic hope . </s>
Let me ask Liz Cheney , if people sign up in one of these countries for the campaign for democracy at America’s urging , and then they find themselves on the outs , uh , by a , uh , a new strong man , what’s our obligation to those people— Well I think it’s an excellent question , I think that , um , the record of the United States in 1991 in Iraq after calling on the Shia in particular to rise up and then not being there to support them , um , is a shame . </s>
And I think it’s something very much our enemies look to . </s>
I think it’s also , uh , something that our allies look to . I think that , those who argue for example that we should leave Iraq today , those who argue that we should pull out of the Middle East today , um , I have not heard them explain what that would mean for the millions of people who have believed us when we’ve said that we are standing for freedom , we’re stranding for a new Middle East . And in fact…I think that , that , in response to one of the points Shibley was making , we have a convergence , it’s a—it’s , often , uh , unusual , maybe too unusual . But we have a convergence today , between what is the right thing to do morally . </s>
What is the right thing to do to live up to America’s heritage , and America’s proper role in the world , which is to promote freedom where we can . A convergence between that and America’s national security interest , which is that today , promoting freedom in the Middle East will make us safer and has made us safer , and I disagree with Shibley , you don’t have to choose . When you have a situation where there’s a convergence between those two objectives , um , it seems to me that it’s pretty clear that the path you go do down is to undertake that policy . On the issue of whether it’s made us safer I would only point out that during the 1990s when the United States was in fact undertaking the policy that they have advocated , we were attacked in 1993 , 1998 , 2000 . Since 2001 , we have not been attacked again . </s>
Now , you can talk about what’s happening in the region , we can argue about that , we can argue about the war in Iraq , as I said I welcome that , I welcome the opportunity to do that . But you can not ignore the fact that since we have been promoting democracy in the Middle East , since we have been standing on the side of those for freedom , as messy , as complicated , as difficult as it is , Al Qaeda has not attacked us here in the US again . It’s not only because of that policy , absolutely , it’s because of…uh , our own policies to take the fight to the enemy , it’s because of what we’ve done to protect the homeland . But surely that policy has been part of it , and you can not ignore that absence of attacks if you make the argument that we’re not safer . </s>
I think Flynt Leverett has something to say about that . Yeah . America’s moral obligation to the kinds of people that you were describing , is first of all , not to lead such people to believe that we will support them in ways that in the end , we will not provide . Our first moral obligation is not to mislead people . </s>
Our second moral obligation , particularly in relation to Iraq , is not to go to war , when we do not have a coherent and plausible plan for stabilizing a country like that , after we have overthrown the regime . To do that , I would argue , is the height of moral irresponsibility . We have a— A question from the audience . </s>
AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) Uh , I have a question for , uh , the side , uh , arguing for the proposition . And granted of course that the United States sometimes does have to make compromises , uh , with dictatorial regimes and sometimes in fact has to wind up being allied with dictatorial regimes , most famously of course in the case of World War II . But what I’m wondering is , are there any regimes so reprehensible in the world today or in recent history , that the side arguing for the proposition would say that we can not be allied with them . </s>
Would you for example say that we should have been allied with the Khmer Rouge as they were running Cambodia and killing 2 million of their citizens . Is there some point at which we actually should draw the line in terms of regimes that we simply can not stomach . And if so what is that line and how do you differ , and differentiate between that , and some of the regimes that we in fact have supported for years in the Middle East . </s>
Well , I— Is there a red line . I most definitely would not be allied with Khmer Rouge . </s>
I most definitely would not be allied with Ahmadinejad , and I most definitely think it was a mistake for us in the past to be seen allied with Saddam Hussein . </s>
But I would have to make one qualifier . That is unless of course , we are facing an apocalyptic threat . That is why Winston Churchill decided to be allied with Stalin . </s>
And if you would look at Churchill’s record , vis-à-vis Communism , he probably was most brutal in , uh , being quite honest about what a horrible regime they had in the Soviet Union at that time . But in comparison with Hitler , and I’m not even sure quite that Churchill was making just a moral judgment , he was making a strategic judgment , he felt that Britain had no choice , and let me say this . I wish our foreign policy was a morality play . I wish there was never tension between what we wish , and what we know is security interests . But there is tension . </s>
And when we are talking about this tension , we are not suggesting that we do not care about the abuse , about those who have no voice . </s>
But we are talking about realistic foreign policy choices . And friends , if you believe in democracy , democracy starts with the serious and informed conversation in home . </s>
Shibley Telhami , you had something to add to that ? Uh , well I—I agree first of all that there are people you don’t deal with , but you know , the choice isn’t between having an ally and , and , and not , I mean , in , in , in most cases there , there are…uh , governments that are bad that you don’t deal with or you can ignore . There’s a difference between , uh , uh , applying sanctions or applying some international , uh , punishment on a—on a regime , and between going to change the system . </s>
Uh , I think that , uh , we’re in a great position , uh , and we were after 9-11 , to mobilize the international community over issues that were of great importance not just to us but to everyone else . And human rights is included in that . And , we have international forums , uh , for a , in which we can take this , we still are the most powerful nation , and peop—we could’ve led in international organizations , uh , to tighten , to , to punish , to , uh , to , uh , exclude people who were violating human rights in the international system , I believe that we need to do that . </s>
I think it is important to have moral values . I think that , national interest can not explain all of what we do , I don’t wan na just be serving my material interests , I’m a—I’m a moral individual , I want my country to stand for moral issues , I don’t deny that . I think we can—are capable of it , if we’re not capable of it as a—as the United States of America , no country is . </s>
We’re far too powerful , not to have something extra to push for the good in the world beyond . </s>
What I’m calling for , is more modesty , more selectivity , more…international , uh , organization , uh , type action . </s>
Uh , not the sort of , uh , I don’t wan na say—arrogance probably is the word , in this particular case , to say that we know what is best and we’re going to bring it about , that’s not values . </s>
Especially , when the morning after , people are far worse as they are in Iraq , than many of them were the day before . </s>
That is not values , that is not spreading good in the world , that is not , when you have more than 2 million refugees , most of whom we’re not even trying to provide for . </s>
Danielle Pletka has a , has a response to what you’ve said , Shibley— I don’t , I don’t , I don’t have a , uh , a ques—a response , I have a question , um , I would like to ask our compatriots whether , uh , had they had the opportunity , um , and were in a position to do so prior to 9-11 , would they have worked to overthrow or change the regime in Afghanistan and remove the Taliban . Oh , good . </s>
Go for it , Dimitri . I was , uh…uh , bus-riding . </s>
And talking to people in the administration , including , uh , to the Secretary of State… about , uh , the need to establish American priorities . And after World Trade Center , after what was done to American , embassies in Africa , I felt very strongly , that the big target had to be , Taliban , and of course Al Qaeda . However , the administration at that time was so upset with what was happening in Russia , and so eager to reduce increasing Russia down to size , that they ignored , then Prime Minister Putin , he was not President yet , Prime Minister Putin , suggestions , that the United States and Russia would work together against Taliban . </s>
Similar felt , that we , instead of focusing on all kinds of things including democracy promotion in Pakistan , had to make that that very issue , Pakistani support for Taliban , the central issue in our dialogue with that government . But we treated foreign policy as a Christmas tree . We did not want to establish priorities . We wanted to do everything at the time . </s>
We can not conduct an experiment in history , I do not know whether to attack Taliban with the Russians , and with the Pakistanis , whether we would be able to prevent September 11th . But you would’ve supported that— we would never know . </s>
But you would’ve supported it , right ? </s>
I most definitely— Like you supported the overthrow of Saddam Hussein . I—as a matter of fact— Right . </s>
I did sup— </s>
I—you did , I know that you did— The amount of— I’m just checking . </s>
I did support the overthrow of Saddam Hussein— </s>
Right , good . You’re absolutely right . I’m thrilled to hear it . </s>
As— And I have no regret— As did I . </s>
As—as a point of advancing democracy , uh , in Iraq ? Uh , that’s , that’s— Not so fast— </s>
That is the big issue . Okay— I thought that Saddam— </s>
Not , no— —Hussein was a threat , I thought that containment was not working , I thought we had to go and try to do it quickly— </s>
—and to turn the project to international organizations . Natan Sharansky . One short note is simply in support of Winston Churchill , because it was mentioned correctly that Winston Churchill had no choice but to cooperate with Stalin to fight Hitler . But immediately after the war , he was the first to declare the beginning of Cold War . He was the first to recognize who—what is the nature of Soviet Union . </s>
And he brought back that moral clarity , which is lacking so much today , thank you . Well , thank you very much for your answers to my questions and the questions we’ve taken from the audience , and we’ve managed to debate not only the spread of democracy in the Middle East today but the , uh…uh , alliance between the United States , Britain and Soviet Union during the Second World War— And I’m sure we could go still further , and , uh , and you’ll yet have another chance to raise these points now in closing , uh , statements which are to run maximum two minutes . Uh , and we begin with , uh , Natan Sharansky . Against the resolution . </s>
Well , uh , it was mentioned already today that some time ago , I together with Vaclav Havel organized an international conference in Prague on security and democracy . And it became like a kind of international meeting of democratic dissidents from all over the world but first of all from Middle East . For there were so many democratic dissidents from Iran and Iraq and Libya and Syria , and Sudan and Egypt and so on . I know by listening to the stories of these people , I think they themselves , were surprised to discover how each of them has the same story . Of personal struggle , a person who wants to be free and wants his country to be free , against totalitarian regime . </s>
And , uh , it was easy to recognize the stories of our dissident stories , mine and Vaclav Havel’s then , and theirs today . With one difference . </s>
We knew… that if we go to prison all the free world will be with us . They know that they , when they go to prison , the free world is debating whether it is in our interest to support them , or their…uh , or the people who jailed them . </s>
One . And that’s a big problem . Frankly speaking , I’d like on today’s debate , Abraham Lincoln who’s been speaking together with us . Because , this President when he came to the office… black Americans were slaves , and even had to rights to walk . </s>
If he was asked if it is good idea to promote democracy , is it…good idea to impose democracy , is stability should be preferred to democracy , what he would answer . He once said—I don’t remember exact quote , I don’t something like this—we will not be the masters , we will not be the slaves . We of course , we are , thank God , we are not slaves . We must make sure that we are not supporting the masters . </s>
To promote democracy , it’s first of all to stop supporting tyr—tyrants in the Middle East . Thank you , uh , Natan Sharansky , now… Now for the resolution , Flynt Leverett . I think that…in making your vote this evening , you have , in many ways , a quite simple choice . </s>
If you believe that the alternative to the house of Saud , the alternative to the Mubarek regime , is a group of Western-educated Jeffersonian democrats , then you ought to vote against the resolution . If you believe as I do , that under current circumstances the alternatives to these incumbent regimes will actually be worse for American interests , and , I think , worse for the people in these countries , then you should vote for the resolution . It is a red herring to say that by saying democracy promotion in the Middle East is a bad idea , we basically are washing our hands of any concern about how the Middle East develops . </s>
One— That is simply not true . There is an enormous ferment in the Persian Gulf today , around economic reform , around , as Liz pointed out , the spread of information technologies , the increasing involvement of the Gulf states , and other Middle Eastern countries in the globalized world of the 21st century . </s>
That is not a product of American policy , in fact I would say we’re not doing enough to support those developments . Egypt can get a free-trade agreement with the European Union but it can’t get a free-trade agreement with us . That’s nuts , we ought to be supporting economic reform in these countries , we ought to be standing up for human rights , and the political development in these countries will then , over time , take care of itself , and in the meantime , we will be much better positioned to fight terror , protect the security of the state of Israel , and protect our most vital interests in the Gulf— Thank you , Flynt Leverett . Speaking for the resolution . </s>
Liz Cheney , against . Um , I think it’s important as you vote tonight to think about the fact that all three of those arguing for the motion , have argued our point . Flynt’s just argued that we ought to be supporting the changes that we’re seeing in the Gulf , not just the economic changes but the expansion of information technology , the expansion of freedom of the press , that’s part of democracy . Dimitri argued that we ought to be supporting freedom of choice . </s>
That’s what we’re doing . Um , and Shibley said we should advocate democracy , we just ought to do it differently . So I think that it’s important for us to focus on what is the debate here tonight , but when we’ve got all three of our opponents arguing that , that the policy itself may have flaws but that in one way or another we ought to be advocating democracy , human rights , freedom , economic reform , uh , it is , uh…hard not to imagine that , that what is , um , urging them to argue for this motion , is a disagreement about our Iraq policy , a disagreement about George Bush , a disagreement about our foreign policy in general . </s>
One . And I think it’s critically important to recognize this isn’t a game . There are real people , real men and women , as I mentioned across the region today , tonight , tomorrow , who believe America will stand with them for freedom . And I think that , that the , uh , great moral disservice that we would do , we could do to them , the greatest moral disservice we could do to them would be to fold our tent in the face of terrorist attack , to fold our tent in the face of extremists , who don’t believe that women should be equal , who don’t believe in freedom of religion , who don’t believe in freedom of speech . Our opponents have also said we need a balanced policy , we need to work with regimes when they can help us in the war on terror , and at the same time we need to be supporting freedom . </s>
That’s what we do . You can say we don’t do it the way you would do it , we could have a debate about how to do it more effectively , but at the end of the day , that is what we’re doing , that is what the policy is , and I think it’s critically important that we don’t abandon those who are standing with us , to help build a world in which we don’t have to fear attack by terrorists . Thank you , Liz Cheney . Uh , closing statement , Shibley Telhami for the resolution . </s>
We need more democratic change , more liberty , more human rights , not words to claim we are doing it , and not promises that we can in fact do it . The train wreck is too long to miss . </s>
It is easy to sell dreams in times of pain , and many after the horror of 9-11 so badly wanted answers . And visions of spreading democracy were too good to resist . If something is imaginable , we thought , it is possible . If something is possible , we thought , it is likely . Thus is the stuff of wishful thinking . </s>
It would still be worth a dream if the costs and reality were not so unbearably high , if it weren’t for the fact that the morning after , has been even worse than the day before . That millions are paying the price . </s>
There’s a time to go with your heart— One . </s>
—and there is a time to go with your mind . And this is the time to go with your mind . Thank you . Thank you…Shibley Telhami . </s>
Danielle Pletka , against the motion . Flynt suggested in his closing remarks that , uh , that if the United States harps on the treaty obligations of , uh , of our , our Arab dictator , uh , friends , then perhaps there will be a greater adherence to human rights . </s>
Um , I recall the Iranian signature of the International Atomic Energy Agency’s nuclear non- proliferation treaty , um , which was not a very effective treaty that was signed , uh , North Korea , same . Uh , all the counter-terrorism treaties , the genocide treaties , the chemical weapons conventions . Pieces of paper make bureaucrats in Washington feel good . They enable them to come home with victories that they can trumpet on the front page of the Washington Post and the New York Times . </s>
But it doesn’t do a great deal for the people who live in these countries , the 300 million people of the Middle East and North Africa who don’t live in freedom . As I came here today and looked out the window and you can see signs hanging from institutions , synagogues in particular that say— One . </s>
—“Save Darfur.” Why is it that we have a special regard for Darfur , but not for the 300 million of the Middle East and North Africa who have lived so long with torture , without freedom , and yes , with genocide as well . Our past failings should not dictate our future failings . And our hearts and our minds should work together , for the right thing in the national interest . </s>
Yes , it’s true , Hitler was elected by democracy . But that does not discredit democracy . To the contrary , those who are willing to accept that decision , and do nothing in the face of the reality that Hitler was an evil , ruthless tyrant , were the Chamberlains . </s>
And those who spoke out to depose and to act and to spread democracy and change in national interest , were with Churchill . </s>
And I think history will judge those who stood on the other side very harshly in this regard as well . Danielle Pletka . And in conclusion Dimitri Simes for the motion . Like Mr. Sharansky , I also lived in the Soviet Union . And , uh , for most of us , the United States was a shining castle . </s>
And the United States stood , not only for prosperity and freedom for the United States , but also for freedom for the rest of us . The big difference however , for—between standing for this kind of freedom , and what we have witnessed during last several years , that every American President , before this one , was taking the position that we would protect and defend freedom of Americans , and of the allies . And whenever possible , would protect freedom of other nations . </s>
The country was not taking upon themselves , telling others on a global scale how they’re supposed to live . </s>
And when you go to the world , and offer indispensable guidance , particularly when you are not particular popular , when you— One— </s>
—are not particularly liked , you know what ? </s>
It creates a backlash . The debate tonight is not about freedom . The debate tonight is whether we want to have a foreign policy which makes us feel good , or do we have to have foreign policy judged by results . And I am convinced , the dissidents in Iran , democrats in Iraq , they want results , not rhetoric . That is why I am in favor of this resolution . </s>
Thank you , Dimitri Simes . And so we’ve heard the concluding remarks , it’s now time to vote . </s>
Uh , once again , please pick up the keypad that’s attached to the left arm-rest of your seat , and after my prompt , press “1” if you are for the motion , the motion again being , that spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea , “2” if you’re against the motion , and “3” if you are undecided . Please cast your vote now . We’ll have the results in a moment . </s>

And thank you to all the panelists , for your fine work . </s>
Thank you . Normally , Robert , you introduce me but I 'll do it myself . </s>
I 'm really sorry . </s>
I was waiting for my cue . I was waiting for that too , I 'm sorry . Well , now John , over to you . That worked so perfectly . </s>
Thank you . Thank you . One more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz to make this all possible . Welcome everyone to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News and , once again , I have the honor of moderating as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the Skirball Center for the performing arts of New York University ; six debaters , three against three will be debating this motion , do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools . Parse out that language that means that if you vote for the motion , you’re voting for exonerating teachers unions . </s>
If you vote against the motion , you’re voting for -- you blame teachers unions . I 'll rephrase that . </s>
You blame teachers ' unions if you’re voting against the motion . Now , this is a debate and I 'm the referee but you , the audience , are actually the judges . You will have been asked by the time this debate ends to vote twice , once before and once after debate to tell us where you stand on this motion . And after hearing the arguments and the second vote , the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . So let 's go now to the vote and the right-hand side of your seat there is a key pad . </s>
Read this motion closely because the language is a little bit challenging . </s>
If you are for the motion , push number one . And for Intelligence Squared U.S. 3 the motion means you exonerate teachers unions . If you are against the motion , push number two . This means that you blame teachers unions for the failure of the schools . </s>
If you are undecided , push number three . </s>
And if you feel that you 've made an error in your selection , just push the correct number and it will lock into the most recent -- your last vote will actually be the one that is recorded . So we 'll tally those votes in a few minutes . </s>
And somewhat into our opening round I will tell you what the first results . I also wanted to share a very brief personal note that I 'm going to declare irrelevant , that my grandfather was a New York City public school teacher . So was my father . So was my mother . And so was my 93 year old Aunt Grace who even now is living in the Bronx . </s>
I will make all of this irrelevant . Because that is my job , to be neutral and to moderate . So let 's get on with round one of our debate , opening statements by each debater . </s>
In turn , they will be seven minutes each , uninterrupted and speaking first for the motion I 'd like to introduce Randi Weingarten who is the president of the American Federation of Teachers , the country 's second largest teachers union and I believe also you have New York city school teachers in your heritage . Absolutely . Many , many of them . Ladies and gentlemen , Randi Weingarten . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen . Thank you , John . Thank you , Bloomberg . </s>
Thank you , NPR and thank you , Mr. Rosenkranz . Look , we have a double challenge today in America . One is the need to compete in a global economy , an economy that has changed hugely even as many of us have been wrestling with it . Number two , we have the effects of the global recession : state and local budgets that are totally and completely decimated right now . </s>
And so when the investment is very , very bleak , as it is right now , and the need is very , very great , it 's no wonder that people are looking to find one entity to blame . But my friends , blaming unions for school failure is like blaming the middle class for the recession . Ultimately what humans do -- what our union does proudly is have a mantra . What is good for kids and what is fair for teachers . </s>
Now , am I saying that everything we 've ever done is the Intelligence Squared U.S. 4 right thing ? Absolutely not . Am I saying that we are perfect ? Absolutely not . But what we are trying to do in this very , very turbulent time is search for what works . </s>
Search for what works for kids . Let me ask -- let me suggest this . If teachers unions were to be blamed for failing schools , then we would assume that schools in less unionized states would outperform schools in more densely unionized states . </s>
So you 'd assume that places like Mississippi , Alabama , Louisiana , who have relatively few unionized teachers would do much , much better . But that 's not the case . The states with the most densely unionized teachers , Massachusetts , New York , Maryland ; they do the best . And the countries with the most densely unionized populations : Finland , Japan , they do the best . So what do we learn from that ? </s>
What we know is that there are problems like Mr. Rosenkranz said . There are problems we have to solve . One of which is poverty . </s>
States like Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi ; they have and had been plagued by tremendous poverty . </s>
We have to compete with poverty . That 's what public education is and that is what the search we have for , that 's what our search is , to find what works . So you felt , I hope tonight we can move from scapegoating to solutions , to problem solving . And I would argue to all of you that having a strong union , someone in an entity that will look at what it 's done right and what it 's done wrong , and solve things and change things , is the way to go . </s>
So what works ? What can we learn from places like Maryland , Massachusetts , New York State , Finland , and Japan ? This is what we can learn . This is what works . What works in places where we do n't as Terry Moe will probably argue , where we do n't have niche markets , where we ca n't marketize our schools , where we have to help all kids . </s>
So we need well-prepared and supported teachers . We need well- rounded rigorous curriculum that engages kids and we can get our arms around . We need to invest in the tools and the time to differentiate instruction . We also need things like early childhood education and a focus and fixation on graduation in terms of high school . And finally , we need good services to help level the playing field for kids . </s>
Now , is this a panacea ? Is this something that has never happened and it 's a search for something we do n't know how to find ? No . We find these elements in lots of different places . And the glue that binds us together , the difference between the places that work and the places that do n't are good labor management relationships . </s>
Like we see in one of my other panelists here , in the ABC school district in California which has lifted its scores , which has changed its relationships from competitive to ones that are collaborative . Does that mean as I said before that we 've done everything . Of course not . Everyone has to take more responsibility in this day and age . </s>
If we 're going to ensure that all kids are ready for life , for college , for career , that means that -- that means we all have to take collective responsibility . And we , at the A.F.T. , attempted to do that in any number of ways : first , in pushing for common standards , including the new common core curriculum or the common core standards in pushing for better aligned assessments , in pushing for better curriculum . And in looking at ourselves and saying look , we have to have a new approach to due process . </s>
We ca n't have rubber rooms anymore . </s>
We ca n't have a choice between off with your heads and warehousing . </s>
We ca n't have situations where if there is incompetence in the classroom we allow that to happen . We have to have more evaluation systems that are fair , that are meaningful , that are competent , and that actually help teachers teach in a more robust way than they may be doing now . But we also have to give teachers the tools and the time and the conditions that they need to do a good job with kids . Because at the end of the day , to compete with poverty , to drift all boats , to Intelligence Squared U.S. 5 make sure that kids get that chance to dream their dreams and to achieve it , it comes with initially that connection between teacher and kid . That connection we made every day that we teach . </s>
That connection I made with my kids at Clara Barton High School that I know Gary made when he taught . I know Kate made when she teaches . We need teachers to have the support of the people around us and the unions . </s>
The unions -- all of us . The unions will do everything in their power to help fight for the tools and the conditions that teachers need and to fight to ensure that every kid , every kid gets a well prepared and well supported teacher . Thank you very much . Thank you , Randi Weingarten . </s>
The motion is do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools . And now to argue against the motion because he does blame teachers unions for the failure of the schools , I 'd like to introduce Terry Moe of the Hoover Institution whose book almost 20 years ago titled `` Politics , Markets and America 's Schools , '' was full of ideas it seemed radical at the time , and that since then have become actually part of school systems , experimental school systems throughout the country . I do n't know whether it 's been the pace you would like , Terry . It 's been 20 years . </s>
Only 20 years . Okay , ladies and gentlemen , Terry Moe . </s>
Thank you very much . It 's great to be here . I want to thank Intelligence Squared for arranging this event and for putting the spotlight on what , in my view , is the most important issue in American education today , the power of the teachers unions . I should be clear that our team is not saying that the teachers unions are responsible for every problem of the public schools . </s>
What we are saying is that the unions are and have long been major obstacles to real reform in the system . And we 're hardly alone in saying this . If you read “Newsweek , ” “Time Magazine , ” the “Washington Post , ” lots of other well- respected publications , they 're all saying the same thing : that the teachers unions are standing in the way of progress . So look . </s>
Let me start with an obvious example . </s>
The teachers unions have fought for all sorts of protections in labor contracts and in state laws that make it virtually impossible to get bad teachers out of the classroom . On average , it takes two years , $ 200,000 , and 15 % of the principal 's total time to get one bad teacher out of the classroom . As a result , principals do n't even try . They give 99 % of teachers -- no joke -- satisfactory evaluations . The bad teachers just stay in the classroom . </s>
Well , if we figure that maybe 5 % of the teachers , that 's a conservative estimate , are bad teachers nationwide , that means that 2.5 million kids are stuck in classrooms with teachers who are n't teaching them anything . This is devastating . And the unions are largely Intelligence Squared U.S. 6 responsible for that . They 're also responsible for seniority provisions in these labor contracts that among other things often allow senior teachers to stake a claim to desirable jobs , even if they 're not good teachers and even if they 're a bad fit for that school . </s>
The seniority rules often require districts to lay off junior people before senior people . </s>
It 's happening all around the country now . </s>
And some of these junior people are some of the best teachers in the district . </s>
And some of the senior people that are being saved are the worst . Okay . So just ask yourself , would anyone in his right mind organize schools in this way , if all they cared about was what 's best for kids ? And the answer is no . But this is the way our schools are actually organized . </s>
And it 's due largely to the power of the unions . Now , these organizational issues are really important , but they 're just part of a larger set of problems . Our nation has been trying to reform the schools since the early 1980s . </s>
And the whole time the teachers ' unions have used their extraordinary power in the political process to try to block reform and make sure that real reform just never happens . </s>
Consider charter schools . There are many kids around this country who are stuck in schools that just are n't teaching them . They need new options . Well , charter schools can provide them with those options . But charter schools are a threat to teachers ' unions . </s>
If you give kids choice and they can leave regular public schools , then they take money and they take jobs with them . And that 's what the teachers ' unions want to stop . So what they 've done is they 've used their power in the political process to put a ceiling on the numbers of charter schools . As a result in this country today , we have 4,600 charter schools . There are like well over 90,000 public schools . </s>
So this is a drop in the bucket . And mean time charter schools have huge waiting lists of people who are desperate to get in . </s>
In Harlem , for example , the charter schools there got 11,000 applications for 2,000 slots recently . So just to give you an idea of about how the politics of this works out , in Detroit a few years ago , a benefactor came forth and said he was willing to donate $ 200 million to set up additional charter schools for the kids in Detroit who obviously need it . What did the union do ? The union went ballistic . They shut down the schools , went to Lansing , demonstrated in the state capitol and got the politicians to turn down the $ 200 million for those kids . </s>
This is good for kids ? </s>
I do n't think so . This is about protecting jobs . The same kind of logic applies with accountability . </s>
Accountability is just common sense . We obviously need to hold schools and teachers accountability for teaching kids what they 're supposed to know . </s>
But the teachers ' unions find this threatening . They say they support accountability but they do n't want teachers held accountable . </s>
Any sensible effort to hold teachers accountable , they brand as scapegoating teachers . </s>
They do n't even want teachers performance to be measured . Right here in New York City , Joel Klein indicated a while ago that he was going to use student test scores as one factor in evaluating teachers for tenure . What did the union do ? Now , this is something that Obama supports , that Arne Duncan supports . </s>
It 's unbelievable . What the union did is they went to Albany and they got their friends in the legislature to pass a law making it illegal to use student test scores in evaluating teachers for tenure anywhere in the state of New York . It 's just outrageous . </s>
And makes no sense from the standpoint of what 's best for kids . </s>
The “New York Times” called it absurd . This is how the unions approach accountability . </s>
Okay , well , I do n't have a whole lot of time left here . So let me just quickly say our opponents are going to say tonight , and Randi has already said , there is really no conflict between standing up for the jobs of teachers and doing what 's best for kids . But the thing is there is a conflict . </s>
And Intelligence Squared U.S. 7 that 's why we ca n't get bad teachers out of the classroom , because they protect them . That 's why the schools have totally perverse organizations imposed on them , and that 's why totally sensible reforms are seriously resisted in the political process . Now , what you 're going to hear , I 'm sure , throughout the evening is that union leaders and unions around the country , they 're actually reformers too . They want to get bad teachers out of the classroom . They say they 're for charter schools ; they 're all in favor of accountability . </s>
Well , not really . Talk is cheap . What counts is what they actually do . And what they do is to oppose reform . This is the reality . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Terry Moe . Our motion is do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools . </s>
I 'd like to introduce our second debater speaking for the motion , not to blame teachers . Kate McLaughlin is an elementary school teacher in Lowell , Massachusetts , at the moment our only active teacher in the debate tonight . Kate , I understand you 've moved on to being a math coach for kids ? Yes . </s>
Do you teach -- I teach children and teachers , kindergarten through fourth grade . Thanks very much for joining us tonight . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Kate McLaughlin . Good evening , everyone . </s>
I too , would like to thank the Rosenkranz Foundation especially for having a teacher come and speak because it is a rare occasion for a teacher to actually be able to talk about education . It 's usually think tanks and professors and others . So I 'm really privileged to be here tonight . </s>
Thank you . The first time I heard about this , do n't blame teachers ' unions , I , too , thought like Randi . I 'm from the common wealth of Massachusetts . Which I 'm very proud to say is number one in the country . Our students perform higher than anybody else in this country academically . </s>
Yet we have the strongest collective bargaining rights in the country . So do me it just does n't add up . And then I started thinking I 'm also a doctoral student so I 'm trying to learn as much as I can about research and so the next thing I did is I went straight to the literature . </s>
Even Professor Moe said publications are all saying the same thing . There is no research to support what he is saying . </s>
There is no research out there that correlates student achievement to collective bargaining rights to teach unionism , either for or against . Intelligence Squared U.S. 8 There is no conclusive evidence so people can say what they want . And publicize . It does n't mean that it 's research-based . </s>
So with that , what do collective bargaining rates do to improve schools ? And I have a lot to say . Not only am I a teacher , I 'm the executive vice-president of the United Teachers of Lowell , and I deal with this firsthand as a union leader . </s>
And for me , what bargaining rights do is they provide dignity a way to provide dignity for a profession that frankly gets beat up on a lot . And the way that we can do that is we can ensure language that improves working conditions for teachers , but also for children . </s>
So one example of that , which unfortunately in my district -- my union has not been able to negotiate yet ; is something like we could have language for class sizes . So early childhood children would be in smaller classes which the research shows is good for them , but that 's a way we can ensure it , by having it in the teachers ' contract . </s>
That 's just one example . The other thing that collective bargaining rights help us with at a local level is it ensures academic freedom . </s>
What that means is there are times as a teacher that I need to advocate for the child . And that means I have to say something unpopular , something that an administrator might not appreciate me saying in front of a parent , and I need to be able to do that , to be the best teacher that I can be . And I need to be able to do that without fear . </s>
And that is why collective bargaining rights are very important when you are in a classroom , you need to be able to do what you know is best for children . </s>
And that is why it 's important . </s>
Besides families , no one cares more about students and their learning , especially students living in poverty , than their teachers . And what the teachers ' unions do at the local level is we serve as a conduit for the teachers . So while my opponents on the motion might say that I have my own agenda , I would argue that is absolutely not true . My agenda is the agenda of the teachers . What the teachers need . </s>
So the way that we find that out at a local level , the president of our union and the superintendent , along with other members of the executive board go to the schools and meet with the teachers and find out what they need to get their jobs done . </s>
We survey our members . And what they need in their classrooms is our agenda . So for example one thing that we 've done is we 've created what 's been called -- the Department of Education in Massachusetts has been called the Cadillac teacher induction program . So the union and management sat down together , that 's the union-initiated protocol , to make sure that every teacher in their first three years of teaching had a qualified and trained mentor . They have access to district designed graduate level courses specifically designed so that they can best meet our students in Lowell who often come with second language issues , they have full training in what they need . </s>
Also with that , the mentors are trained to talk to their mentees about whether they 're in the right place or not . </s>
And to counsel them perhaps out of urban education , if that 's not what 's meeting their need or meeting the children 's need . And also , to help them make better choices . </s>
Another thing that was union initiated that is in our contract , we call the Lowell program . </s>
It 's an in-house graduate program where teachers can get their master 's degree . Again , the superintendent and her colleagues have decided what the content of the course is , and we work together so that teachers are given the tools that they need . In terms of evaluations , our evaluation procedures in Lowell as negotiated are actually more stringent than what 's required by state standard . So our new teachers are evaluated twice every year , whereas the state only mandates once . </s>
So in terms of unions advocating for poor evaluation measures , it 's just not true . The most important thing in my opinion about what we 've done -- and I ca n't speak to 20 years ago because unfortunately , I was only in high school , but I can Intelligence Squared U.S. 9 speak to what 's happening in schools now . And what we are doing is this labor management union . </s>
Because with all due respect , we have been -- the teachers have been told what to do . We 've been given scripted curricula from under reading first grants and under these grants , and we found -- the teachers found they were not working for children . 19:09:52 We 've told what to do . Now what we need to do is have a seat at the table to be part of the decision making . </s>
And so in Lowell we have begun this journey to build collaborative structures in our district between labor and management so the people at the ground floor , the teachers , can inform the decisions that are made for children . So it is , indeed , what is best for them . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Kate McLaughlin . Here is where we are on the debate . </s>
We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan . Acting as moderator , we have six debaters : three against three fighting it out over this motion . Do n't blame teachers ' unions for our failing schools . </s>
We 've heard from three debaters three opening statements . </s>
And now on to our fourth to speak against the motion I 'd like to introduce Rod Paige who is famously the U.S. Secretary of Education under the Bush administration , even more famously once called teachers unions terrorist groups . I knew that was going to come up . It has to come up . And also his own background in education , he is the son of a school principal in rural Mississippi who , to make ends meet , also worked as a barber , I believe , is that correct , Rod ? </s>
That 's correct . And how times have changed . Or perhaps they have not . Ladies and gentlemen , Rod Paige . Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . </s>
I 'm here to convince you to vote against this proposition . All of us know that teachers are not solely to blame for our failing schools . But they bear significant responsibility and the way this is framed , the only way to express that is to vote against this proposition . Now , to understand my point of view , you have to realize how powerful these organizations are . To be blunt , teachers unions Intelligence Squared U.S. 10 represent the most dominant political force in American education . </s>
We 're not talking about little wimpy organizations . We 're talking about mammoth highly financed , highly organized , highly peopled organizations . And political dominance is not something that they got unintentionally . They intended to be politically dominant . Here is a quote from Sam Lambert in 1967 about NEA . </s>
NEA would become the political -- become a political power second to no other special interest group . Listen to those words . People could argue now that they 've already reached that goal . Teacher unions represent the number one political spender in the United States of America . </s>
In the state of California , the NEA spent more in the last decades than any other political spender and the second political spender spent less by a little bitter than 1/2 of what the NEA spent . These are powerful , dominant organizations . </s>
The NEA has 3.2 million members , 14,000 locals across the United States , and last year -- in 2007 they collected about $ 400 million from their members to supplement the other revenue streams that they had . The AFT is not a slouch either . </s>
They have 1.4 million members , 300 locals across the United States . And they 're active in 43 states . </s>
NEA has state offices in every state in the United States . </s>
And that 's not all . They can call on their political partners when they get in trouble . They can call on the AFL-CIO . </s>
They can call on Acorn . They can call on People for the American Way . </s>
They can call on the Center for Community Change . </s>
These are mammoth organizations and I need for you to understand that in order to understand why we take this position . Now , the American workforce , about 12 % of the workforce is unionized . </s>
But in the education profession , it 's 38 % . Teachers ' unions literally have our schools in a chokehold . This is completely dangerous . </s>
Now , power corrupts . Total power corrupts totally . </s>
You need to be clear about how they use this power . To try to convince people -- you heard a lot tonight about children and their members . </s>
Do n't be fooled . Organizations have one primary interest . They may have some other interests but they have one main interest . Teachers ' unions’ main interest is the welfare of their members . </s>
Another quote from NEA operative , “The main purpose of our association” -- note the word association . They do n't even call themselves unions . It’s not the education of children , but rather it is all to be the extension and preservation of our members ' rights . Now , that 's just a statement of fact . </s>
Organizations ca n't serve 2 gods , little “g.” They serve one . And in the case of teachers ' unions , it is the interests of their members . Now , let me tell you a live story . In 2000 , a Buffalo school district had about 7,000 members and they were the most unionized public school system in the United States of America . </s>
And 7:00 a.m. , on a school day , the leaders of the teachers ' unions still on the Buffalo headquarters step called a strike at 7:00 a.m. on a school day . Now , many children already are on buses on the way to school . </s>
Many parents have already dropped kids off at school leaving their kids in the love care of teachers . Mistakenly . Does that sound like an organization that cares about kids ? They were arguing for employee rights . </s>
Two more major points that really tick me off to some extent . Teachers unions are sitting on both sides of the negotiating table in many cases . They -- teachers unions work with school boards so that they have representatives on the school boards . When I served as superintendent of Houston , one of my nine school board Intelligence Squared U.S. 11 employees , actually an employee of the teachers unions , fortunately for me , both were reasonable people and we got along rather well . </s>
But many school district superintendents do n't have that luxury . They have school -- they have school boards that have teachers unions representatives sitting on that side of the table ; the unions sitting on this side of the table . They 're negotiating with themselves . </s>
They 're sitting on both sides of the negotiating table . Here is the worst thing , I think , that really fires me up . Teachers unions have awesome power to cause action in schools . </s>
They have zero responsibility for their student performance . That 's just not fair . That 's not fair . It handicaps the principals and the superintendents who are operating with both hands tied behind their back . The teachers unions are calling the rules . </s>
They 're responsible for student achievement . That 's no way to run a ship . And it simply will not work that way . Now , here again , I want to be honest and I want to be fair . We ca n't solely blame teachers unions for these complex issues we have in our school situation but they do bear significant responsibility . </s>
And the only way you can express that is to vote against this motion to indicate that we are the nation . </s>
If we 're going to really reform our schools , we 're going to have to wind back from the power of teachers unions . We can still have teachers unions . </s>
We 're not arguing that we should n't have teachers unions . Our schools are over unionized and consequently reform has run into a road block . Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you , Rod Paige . The motion is do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools and now to speak for the motion -- and we just heard Rod Paige say that superintendents have their hands tied by the unions . Well , Gary Smuts is a school superintendent of the ABC unified district in California , considered a district where the schools work and Gary , you have said in the past you do work effectively and successfully with unions . Ladies and gentlemen , Larry Smuts . </s>
Excuse me . </s>
I need to correct that for the record . Because it 's not Larry , it 's Gary . Ladies and gentlemen , Gary Smuts . </s>
Both of us are here tonight . Secretary Paige , in a wonderful book he wrote with his sister , Dr. Elaine Witty , it was entitled `` The Black/White Achievement Gap : Why Closing it is the Greatest Civil Rights Issue of Our Time . '' He says in the book , `` Being taught to higher levels means educational support from factors outside of school . It involves the support and commitment from the entire education triage : home , school , and community . '' And Secretary Paige 's call to improve the effectiveness of our schools recalls an article co-written by Professor Moe entitled , `` Letting Schools Work . '' 19:19:43 In that article , Professor Moe reports , `` Effective schools treat teachers professionally . </s>
The teachers share in the school 's goals and effective teaching in the pursuit of those goals . They participate extensively in school decisions within their classrooms . They are free to tailor their practices to the needs of their students , that effective schools are organized like teams held together by consensus , cooperation , and shared goals . '' It Intelligence Squared U.S. 12 sounds like a teacher 's union to me . </s>
Thank you , Professor Moe . Now , I must clearly delineate my prejudice , my frame of reference . I am from the ABC Unified School District , southern California , about 21,000 students . </s>
We 're about 89 % diverse , 38 different languages spoken in my school district . We have a remarkable relationship with our affiliate , the ABC-AFT . We 're affiliated with the national American Federation of Teachers , second largest teachers union in the United States . We 've formed our own charter and ABC is not a charter school . </s>
We have a charter partnership agreement with the ABC/AFT where the main work of the teachers ' union in my district is student achievement and the conditions that support that . Student achievement is the main work of our teachers ' union . </s>
In fact , last year , Laura Rico , the president of my teachers ' union had a workshop where all the union reps came in and they changed their name from union rep to learning rep . </s>
And they were told by the teachers ' union president the number one job that you have in this union is student achievement . Now , that does n't sound like a teacher 's union that has anything other than their main goal , the main idea that Secretary Paige talked about -- in my district , our union , and student achievement . Here are some examples of staff development in my district that 's jointly sponsored by myself and our colleagues , American Federation of Teachers . It does n't -- what I 'm going to describe to you actually comes from the national AFT , from their educational research and dissemination program . </s>
These are some of the courses that are caught by our teacher 's union : instructional strategies that work ; reading comprehension ; school , family , and community partnerships supporting student learning , which is actually almost exactly what Secretary Paige points out in his book that we need to improve schools . We spend -- actually my teacher 's union spends 10s of thousands of dollars in direct staff development with our community and our teachers to improve learning . Now , do n't blame my district 's union for failing schools . They 're one of the reasons my district is successful . Now , we have our challenges . </s>
We 're a program improvement district . Last year , despite $ 34 million in budget cuts , we doubled the greatest gains in the history of the district . We passed the magic benchmark of 814 -- 800 , actually in California , went to 814 . We did n't do that despite the teacher 's union . </s>
We did that because of the teacher 's union . Let me give you an example . </s>
In my district , 10 of my schools -- these are struggling schools that have just received an innovation grant where each of these schools has a separate program to innovate and improve that school specifically tailored to the needs of that individual school . That innovation grant came from the American Federation of Teachers National Organization . </s>
$ 3.3 million in innovation grants funded the ABC Unified School district , 10 of our 30 schools . That 's not just in California or ABC . </s>
Actually , the grant funded programs and districts in 8 different states . The American Federation of Teachers National Organization is one of the most innovative programs in the United States . </s>
Now , some of the things that those innovation grants are funding in my district , I said partnership efforts in 10 schools . In other districts throughout the United States , they 're working on community partnerships , working on using student assessment data to evaluate teachers . They 're also working on creating charter schools . So if you 're for charters , if you 're for holding teachers accountable , using student assessment data , listen to the American Federation of Teachers . </s>
Now , Secretary Paige , Randi Weingarten agrees with you . That great teachers make the real difference in closing the achievement gap . In fact , the “Washington Post” reported in January that Randi said , `` Fair , transparent , and expedient processes to identify and deal with Intelligence Squared U.S. 13 ineffective teachers need to be developed . '' And she specifically pointed to student assessment data . </s>
Now , her direction was put in action most recently in the New Haven Federation of Teachers district by a vote of 842 to 39 . That district agreed to use student assessment data to evaluate teachers . </s>
In addition , they agreed that the city could close schools if they did n't work and change the employees . Now , twice each year American Federation of Teachers hosts the Shanker Institute . </s>
I have been proud to be part of that since 2005 . Let me tell you what we learned at the Shanker Institute . These are different workshops : state standards curriculum bridging the gap , partnering for a reform in troubled times , improving the quality and the use of student assessment data . The unions’ role in assuring that teacher quality matters -- teacher quality meets student needs . </s>
In every seminar I have been to , there has never been a session on how to keep crummy teachers . They do n't do that . </s>
And in fact , in most cases , the superintendents I know that work closely with teachers unions find that we release more teachers to other industries than we do keeping them . </s>
In fact , in nearby Brooklyn , there is the United Federation of Teacher Institute . They do much the same thing . They use data , talk about communication , team building , professional development and action plans . States with teachers unions set the highest standards , according to “Education Week.” “U.S . News and World Report” reported on the most -- 25 most successful schools . </s>
Six out of 10 of those schools come from states with strong teacher 's unions . Success , high standards , accountability . If you want that , support teacher 's unions in schools where that works . Thank you , Gary Smuts . Now we have our Larry . </s>
That 's where I got mixed up . I 'd like to introduce to speak against the motion -- and our motion is do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools -- our next debater does blame teachers unions for our failing schools . Larry Sand is a retired teacher and former teachers union member who grew disillusioned with the operation . He founded the California Teacher 's Empowerment Network , and I 've seen you described , Larry , in print as a pain in the union 's back side . </s>
I assume we 'll see why . Ladies and gentlemen , Larry Sand . I 'm glad Gary brought up Mr. Shanker , because he is alleged to have said when school children start paying dues , that 's when I 'll start representing them . Now , I do n't know if he did say that . </s>
Some people think he did , some say no . </s>
But that has been the teacher 's union attitude ever since I began my teaching career here in New York City in 1971 . </s>
In educating children , there is nothing more valuable than a dedicated and gifted teacher and nothing more harmful and destructive than a bad one . And it 's those teachers , the Intelligence Squared U.S. 14 mediocre and the incompetent ones that the unions typically represent . In fact , they punish good teachers in numerous ways . Unions insist that school districts not pay good teachers what they 're worth . They insist on an archaic factory model of payment whereby teachers make more money by years on the job -- not productive years , just by calendar progression . </s>
Consider the greatest teacher of our time , Jaime Escalante , subject of the film “Stand and Deliver , ” now unfortunately near death in his native Bolivia ; attracted national attention at Garfield high school in Los Angeles with his spectacular success teaching college level calculus to gang members and other unteachables . Talk about poor students . What was the problem ? </s>
Because he was willing to have more students in his class than the United Teachers of Los Angeles contract allowed for , he was basically run out of town by that union . When there are layoffs due to budget cuts , do the worst teachers get laid off ? No . Do the permanents or tenure , a union must in every contract , the newest hires are let go . </s>
You 're a teacher of the year ? Too bad . </s>
You 're double test scores ? Too bad . </s>
But the unions will go to any length , any length to save the job of a bad tenured teacher . If you think I 'm exaggerating , here is a quote from an LA union rep . If I 'm representing them it 's impossible to get them out . It 's impossible unless they commit a lewd act . End quote . </s>
And maybe not even then . You 're laughing . This is a true story and this did n't happen very long ago . Was a former colleague , he 's alleged to have touched a female student inappropriately . </s>
There are witnesses . The female student would not press charges . So they put X into the district office for a while , the so-called rubber room , which probably most of you know of . </s>
They decided to put him , by the union lore , they put him in another school . He apparently did the same thing . Back to the rubber room : sitting , sitting . Finally , one day , I guess he got bored . </s>
He decided to bring porn to the district office , the rubber room . He got caught . With the union lawyers’ help , he got put back into a school , another school , the third school now . And in short order , he got caught showing his female students some of his pornography collection . </s>
The last I heard he 's back in a district office waiting for his union lawyer to make the next move . This is the kind of guy that really needs the union . </s>
Not a dedicated teacher . Not an honest teacher here . This is the kind of guy who really needs the union . By the way , the guy I 'm talking about , Mr. X. is really a pussy cat compared to some of the teachers you have in New York . Just reading some things about a -- I 'm only saying his name because it 's in the newspapers , Francisco Olivares , who impregnated one of his students and his still on the payroll . </s>
Another instance of my middle school involved a teacher who decided to sunbathe topless on the athletic field at lunch . </s>
It was a nice spring day . What happened ? With the union 's help , she was put back into school in an elementary school this time . Once again , a union rep in his own words , “I 've gone in and defended teachers who should n't even be pumping gas.” </s>
Not my quote . This Intelligence Squared U.S. 15 is a union rep . That 's the mentality . Unions today function more like criminal lawyers than partners in education reform . Very importantly , too , the unions love the status quo and will fight to keep it . </s>
In California recently , education reformer , Bill Evers was attacked by a local union for trying to get Singapore math a new and innovative way of teaching a subject , but because learning all the different things you had to do to teach this was a little bit too much for some of the teachers , the unions decide to kill it . Very importantly , the unions are constantly trying to limit the number of charter schools . </s>
“The Cartel , ” an excellent film by Bob Bowden , about public education has one of the most affecting scenes I 've ever seen on film . </s>
It shows parents and children waiting to see if they won the lottery . That is if they got into the charter school . </s>
If charter schools have more children than seats available , very simply they 'll hold a lottery . And in this scene the camera goes into -- close on the faces of the children and the parents who are winning the lottery and getting to the charter school and they 're thrilled and you feel happy for them . And then they go into the people who did n't win , and these people are crying and sad and you feel horrible for them : very affecting scene . </s>
But these tears of joy and anger -- tears of joy and sadness turn to anger because you realize the unions are constantly fighting the establishment of charter schools as the UTLA did just about two weeks ago in Los Angeles . </s>
They were very successful at killing charter schools . Another abominable example , I 'm going to speak a little quickly because I 'm running out of time . The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program , it was created to rescue at least some children from the horrible school district , Washington D.C . We spent $ 27,000 per student . Probably the worst school system in the country . </s>
1,700 kids , mostly poor , mostly black , won the lottery which gave them a $ 7,500 scholarship to get into the best schools they could , private or parochial . </s>
The program was a great success . </s>
The kids looked forward to going to school for the first time . </s>
They thrived . The parents were happy . </s>
The taxpayers saved money . The only ones not happy were the unions who can not abide any competition for the government run monopolies , even though it has been shown that when school choice exists , public schools improve . I will close with a quote from Ron Williams who said about this situation , “The NEA seems far more devoted to its members than they are of the children they teach . It does n't seem to bother them that they continue to fail the nation 's most vulnerable children.” </s>
Amen to that , Mr. Williams . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Larry Sand . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared debate . We now have the results of our initial vote where we asked you , the live audience , to tell us where you stand on the motion . </s>
Our motion is do n't blame teacher 's union for our failing schools . Before the debate , the vote went like this . Those for the motion , those who say it 's not the teacher 's fault : 24 % . Those who blame teacher 's unions for our Intelligence Squared U.S. 16 failing schools , against the motion : 43 % . And we have 33 % undecided . </s>
We 'll ask you to vote once again at the end of the debate , and the team that changes the most minds during the course of the debate will be declared our winner . Now , on to round two . This is our middle round in which the debaters talk directly to one another , and take questions from me and also from you in the audience . And I want to begin with a couple of specifics -- specific charges that were laid out there without responded to . </s>
Terry Moe specifically saying that teachers unions operate against the whole notion of charter schools , that they try to stop them wherever they find them . </s>
I want to hear from the other side , true or not true . Let’s start with Randi Weingarten . Well , given that the United Federation of Teachers under my watch , started two charter schools in Eastern York , it’s totally and completely untrue . What we want to do is we want charters to be held to the same accountability standards including the ones that we started , as any other school and what the evidence has been in New York , like the evidence around the country , is that charter schools instead of , as Diane Ravitch said , should take more of the most at-risk kids are actually taking fewer special needs kids and fewer kids with limited English proficiency . </s>
So we’ve open to , we think charters could be a great incubator for instructional practice and could be a great incubator for labor relations practice . But Terry , I don’t want New York to be as much as an evidentiary zone as Washington D.C. seems to be , which means let’s look at the Credo story which were done with a pro-charter advocate . What they said was , where 17 percent of the charters are better than public schools , 34 percent are worse , and the rest are the same . </s>
The idea is to actually find what works , make it sustainable and make it replicable . That’s what we’re trying to do and that’s what I’m trying to do . </s>
Terry Moe , Randi Weingarten is saying no , it’s not true that they are against all charter schools . </s>
Well let me first point out that New York State has a cap on the number of charter schools . It has a cap because this union put it there . </s>
And even under the pressure of race to the top , they wouldn’t lift the cap . Right , so this is not an organization that’s in favor of charter schools . They’ve done everything they can to keep charter schools down . What they’re doing now in New York City is they’re running three charter schools to show if they can , that unionized charter schools can work , because what they want to do , is to unionize all the charter schools . That’s the only reason they’re doing it . </s>
Intelligence Squared U.S. 17 Randi . I mean , what’s interesting Terry is that I didn’t know you were in my head so much . We are not running charter schools to unionize all charter schools . Where’d the cap come from ? </s>
What we wanted to do , what we wanted to do was actually the New York City and State Union were in favor of lifting the cap and in favor of creating a level playing field to make sure that all kids could equally get into all schools . And if you recall , New York State became one of the finalists for Race to the Top so obviously whatever happened in the state legislature didn’t disqualify us from Race to the Top . </s>
The bottom line is , we need schools -- all schools : charter , public , private to be places where parents want to send their kids and where educators want to work . </s>
That’s the bottom line . How do we help all kids , not just some kids , but all kids . Do you want to respond because I want to move on to another question , but if you’d like to respond . I’ll just make one point . </s>
I mean , this is the standard response that it’s really all about kids ? But the fact of the matter is , they’re trying to keep the number of charter schools down . </s>
They’re responsible for this cap in New York State and everything else is just a rationalization . Terry , I wish we had the kind of -- </s>
Randi , I’m going to go on . Kate McLaughlin , who is arguing . Charter schools in L.A . </s>
Gary Smuts , I’m going to let you go . Gary Smuts , I just want to get to the -- Intelligence Squared U.S. 18 Charter schools in L.A. and there’s magnet schools in L.A. “L.A . Times” article about two months ago by Howard Bloom pointed out that the most successful schools in the L.A. Unified School District are magnet schools . Now these aren’t schools that shut down , get rid of kids , get rid of teachers ; these are schools that have a special focus , that keep their faculty . </s>
If you want the most successful schools in the L.A. area , it’s not charters . It’s not traditional schools . It’s magnet schools that have the same configuration , the same union . If you want success , go with magnets . Don’t go with charters , and don’t even go with traditional schools . </s>
One more response from this side . Are these magnet schools , schools of choice ? Most of the magnet -- all of the magnet schools , I’ll answer this in my district . I have 10 magnet schools in my district . </s>
Students can -- no student leaves those schools , no teachers leave those school . We invite other students substantially though , better than 95 percent of the students are the same students that have always been there . 19:39:49 And those schools are successful . Larry Sand . </s>
Yeah , just here in New York City , in Harlem , we have very successful charter schools like KIPP , Democracy Prep , and Harlem Success . </s>
The parents , as far as I know , there are n't enough to keep up with the demand , yet Randi is saying that -- seems to have a problem with charters . So she wants to go very slowly . </s>
It seems that the parents want these things because most of their kids are in hell holes . Now , this is not the -- this is not the union 's fault that they 're in hell holes necessarily , but it 's the union 's fault because they keep them in hell holes . The best from a local standpoint -- in Lowell , Massachusetts , it 's quite the opposite . They are actually closing the -- they actually force -- they wanted to close the charter Intelligence Squared U.S. 19 school . </s>
And we actually appealed on their behalf , so they have to cut the school in half and stop teaching middle schoolers , and we will absorb those students back in the local -- You 're saying that the union stood up for the charter school ? And the -- the school system . But what you do n't know -- again , you say , oh , teachers are against charter schools . </s>
You 're making up the story why -- </s>
-- I am . Let me tell you why I am . </s>
They -- actually , they 're not saying that . </s>
They are saying teachers unions use political power -- -- use political power to stop the proliferation of -- </s>
No , listen to -- </s>
With a teacher 's -- From a -- With a teacher union . </s>
Rod Paige , I want to let Kate finish . </s>
From a local standpoint , we -- from this charter school that was going to be announced -- got students back from this charter school which we welcomed . We do n't get the funding for them for another year . So when the teachers unions bring up this issue , we 're somehow against charter schools . There are major issues about the funding that comes Intelligence Squared U.S. 20 with it . But when we speak it up , we 're somehow obstructionist . </s>
That is not the case . The other issue about charter schools for me and for my type offers union is it 's an equity issue . </s>
And my teachers union president has gone even to the governor and suggested that if charter schools are truly innovative , they should be a draft and not a cream of the crop selection . They are not the cream of the crop -- And that -- and it is a total equity issue because we 've all agreed that achievement gaps come from school-based issues . They come from social issues , and they come from economic issues . And if you alone base a lottery on which parents have gone to sign up , you have already changed some of those issues . </s>
So it is an equity issue . </s>
To the other side , Larry Sand . Go see Bob Bowden’s film . You tell me those parents and those kids are the cream . These are poor people . </s>
Maybe they 're the cream of the poor people . I do n't know . Let 's bring this back to the issue of unions . And I want to go to the side that is arguing that teachers unions are to be blamed for the failure of the schools . And the other side , your opponents are arguing -- two of your opponents used in their arguments the point that there is no real correlation between states that have strong teachers unions and poor academic achievement . </s>
Kate McLaughlin , your opponent said there is absolutely no research on that . </s>
And Randi Weingarten pointed to the numbers of states where actually there were strong unions and strong school results . I 'd like one of you to respond to that . I 'd be happy to respond , but I do n't know where this stuff comes from , really . Look , many , many , many , many factors influence student achievement . And to say basically that schools in the South do n't do as well as schools in the North , which is true , and that schools in the South do n't have unions and the schools in the North do , and to say , gee whiz , it must be because unions are good for schools . </s>
I -- do n't try that at a university . It does n't wash . Intelligence Squared U.S. 21 So , look , as far as the research goes , I do n't know where Kate 's getting this . I mean , there is a research literature . Actually , it 's pretty big on the impact of collective bargaining on student achievement . </s>
She says there 's nothing . There is , plenty . </s>
It started sort of back in the 1980s . </s>
Most of the literature I think is not good . But that 's typical of most of social science . A lot of this stuff is bad . And part of the reason is that things are complicated . It 's very hard to do good studies . </s>
So you ca n't just like count up studies . The results in this literature are pretty mixed . And I think it 's partly because , A , it 's complicated , and B , a lot of the studies do n't do it very well . But there are two studies that are actually in very top-level journals , they have been through very rigorous peer review process . </s>
They are one by Caroline Hoxby in the “Quarterly Journal of Economics , ” 1996 . Another one is by me in -- But that one 's really good . Yeah , this -- it 's a lot better than Caroline 's . </s>
And it is in the “American Journal of Political Science , ” 2009 . Both these studies show , through a quantitative analysis , both of them very extensive , that the impact of collective bargaining on student achievement is negative . Okay . Randi Weingarten , teachers union president . </s>
So , Terry , you 've actually just made the point that I think many of us are trying to make on this side , which is it is complicated . </s>
There is not one factor that either causes student success or -- or is an obstacle to it . </s>
And that 's exactly what we are trying to say . So ultimately , just like we did not say that teacher unions were the reason why Maryland or Massachusetts or New York were so successful -- and by the way , that was just in quality counts from education week . We were not the ones that said that Finland or Japan were most successful . We 're just saying that those are the correlations . Now , there is one person who used to actually agree with you hugely Diane Ravitch who , in looking at much of the evidence over the course of time , whether it was on charters or whether it was on vouchers has thrill just written a book saying slow down . </s>
The evidence of these kinds of market strategies just does n't work . My point is this : Whether you look at -- everyone is going to find anecdotes to fit into their case . </s>
That 's not going to help one more child learn . We are searching for what actually works . So regardless of the quotes when they hurl at me from the NEA or from other places , I stand by the record that we have in turning around schools in New York City . Mr. Rudy Crew , who is sitting there , and I , together did probably the most important reform strategy in New York in the late 1990s , early 2000 , where we actually turned around schools in Harlem . </s>
We turned around schools in New York City . We want to make sure every single child has a choice . </s>
Once they have a choice for a charter , so be it . </s>
But every child should have a choice for a Intelligence Squared U.S. 22 neighborhood high school or a neighborhood school . And Larry , last point to you , which is this : Just recently , unlike what you said about LA , in LA , there were 36 schools that were put up for grabs by the LA school board . The charters love this . </s>
They wanted this competition . And in that competition , regular school teachers , supported by their union , won 29 of the 36 schools because of their plans . </s>
The bottom line is we need to do the things that Gary and Kate talked about in terms of helping all kids , well prepared and supported teachers , real engaged curriculum , safe and orderly environments which is what we see in charter schools all the time , good , good management that works together . </s>
And at the end of the day , if we have to find ways , as I said in 2004 , to police our own profession , fire teachers that are not making the grade , we want to do that . That 's who this teachers union is . Okay , I want -- We want the best and the brightest for all of our young people in this country . All right , Randi , I gave you quite a long run with that . </s>
Sorry . And I want -- Sorry . </s>
That 's all right , but I do want to urge us to stay as close as possible to our motions . And I think all of us probably share a sense that we want things to improve . But I want to discourage too much grand-standing on the point because we really want to get to the issue at hand . I want to go to the audience . That 's not to say that any of us disagree with that . </s>
Just the nature of the debate . </s>
I want to go to the audience for questions now . And what we will do is have microphones circulate in the aisles . </s>
And if you raise your hands and identify you , please stand , and I 'll bring a microphone to you . Hold it about a fist 's distance away from your mouth so that the radio audience can hear you . </s>
And I want to urge to you Intelligence Squared U.S. 23 actually ask questions and to try to move this debate along in the area in which we are talking and not to make grand-standing speeches or to debate the debaters . They are here to debate each other , I hope prompted by you . And there 's a gentleman , a person with eyeglasses there getting the microphone now . </s>
If you could just rise , sir , and identify yourself . </s>
Well , I make two -- two sentences . </s>
I would rather that you just make one statement and go to a question . Yes , okay . You do n't have problem with having a good car . </s>
You know which cars are good and you can choose . You know this debate there was parents who have basically forgotten and the question is , in the last two , three decades , have teachers unions helped parents to know which teachers are good and which teachers are bad , and second , have they helped parents during the last two , three decades , not last two , three years , helped parents to be able to choose good teachers ? All right , I 'm going to take this -- thank you , sir , we get the point , and we need to move on . </s>
So I think the question probably , both sides can respond , but probably is primarily directed to this side . And I also think it 's a rephrasing of the question or a statement that 's been put forward by your opponents who argue that the interests of teachers ' unions are not the interests of the children , and none of you have actually addressed that particular point directly , that point being , as has been stated , that teachers ' unions are there to grow their numbers , to protect their salaries , to protect seniority . And in terms of those specifics , if you can connect that to the gentleman 's question , is it good for our kids and is it good for the parents in knowing what teachers are good and what teachers are bad . I taught for 14 years -- Gary Smuts . </s>
-- and never did I grade a test or work with my class thinking that -- about my standing in the teachers ' union . That does n't even go through your mind . I would agree that teachers unions do n't rank teachers , but neither do administrators . </s>
There 's no ranking of teachers in any school by anybody . I do n't even know if it 's possible . I do n't even know if it 's desirable . It would n't be something I would recommend that management do or teachers unions do . I do n't think it can be done . </s>
I do n't think it necessarily should be done . There are a variety of factors . We 've all had teachers that have been enormously successful Intelligence Squared U.S. 24 with some folks and not very successful with others . </s>
You ca n't blame teachers unions for not ranking teachers because nobody ranks teachers like that . And what about the part of the question I brought , too , because this is an itch I need scratched the whole issue that the objectives of a union is not the same thing as the objective of taking care of the kids in the best possible way in the educational system . That 's not true in my district . The changed their name from union rep to learning rep . </s>
And it 's not -- </s>
Let 's hear this out because -- The number one focus of the teachers ' union and in the workshop where that was done , what they worked on , were all of the strategies and techniques to produce successful students . The number one job according to my union president of the union reps , the reps in my district , is student achievement . And we work together to do that . </s>
It 's one of the most powerful forces in our district . I 've had great administrators and they work with teachers to produce successful students . Why would you want it any other way ? Fighting each other does n't work . It 's a dumb plan to fight each other and say , `` One side 's going to win , and one side 's going to lose . '' </s>
I do n't believe in that . You know you got to work together , and if you do n't , it is never going to work . </s>
That side said that you never -- Secretary Paige said , `` You 're never going to do away with teachers ' unions . '' He does n't want to do that . If that 's the truth , then we 'd better start working together or we 're going to die together . I think if you look at the -- rather than -- Randi , can you hold a minute -- </s>
Okay . Intelligence Squared U.S. 25 -- because we 've had quite a bit from this side , and I will come back to you . </s>
Terry Moe , I had indicated you could respond to this . Terry Moe . Yeah , I just wanted to say that basically the teachers ' unions do n't want teacher performance to be measured , and they especially do n't want any information to get out about how well teachers do . Actually the testing technology is quite sophisticated now . </s>
And it 's possible , not just to do value added calculations for how much kids learn during a year but also to take into account , through statistical controls , student background characteristics , how much students know at the beginning of the year so that you can control for that , and so on . And so it is certainly possible to do these things in a very systematic and rigorous and fair way . And I think what we 're going to be leading toward eventually , unless the teachers ' unions are able to block it , is a system where we have information on teacher performance under a variety of conditions and we move towards transparency , where it is possible to let people know what teachers are good and what teachers are not good , because if teachers are not good , people should know that so that they do n't put their kids in those classrooms . It 's very important . </s>
Randi Weingarten . Well , well -- Well , let me just bring in Randi Weingarten , please . Well -- There 's no -- </s>
I 'd like to bring in Randi Weingarten , and then I 'll come back to you . Okay . Intelligence Squared U.S. 26 I will . </s>
So the question is -- the question , I think , John , you keep on asking is , what’s the teacher union job ? And if you look at the three of us , and you actually listen to our members , you’re actually right . We are paid to listen to our members because very few other people actually do listen to the voices of teachers . </s>
There was a Gates study recently that said that of 40,000 teachers , that said that overwhelmingly what they wanted ; number one issue is they wanted to be supported ; they wanted to be respected . That is very similar to polling that we have taken of our members and very similar to what I see when I was a local union president , where we had the most extraordinary people in New York City teaching in our classrooms . What we see is that members by a four to one and five to one margin have said to us , they want us to fight for the tools and conditions they need to do their jobs . And ultimately , when we try to fight for budgets for schools , when we try to fight for equity ; when we try to fight to ensure that class sizes are low and that they’re safe and reasonable environments for kids so that kids don’t get bullied , when in some ways we try to fight for the things that I know the Harlem parents have tried to fight for in the schools that they have . </s>
That’s the integration between teacher unions and kids . Okay , Rod Page . I’m going to go back to the ranking of teachers . And I’ll admit that I can agree that there’s no formal ranking of teachers . But let me tell you , there is a ranking of teachers , while I served as superintendent of schools in Houston , it was very clear to me that the kids know who the best teachers are . </s>
They know who the poor teachers are . The other teachers know who the poor teachers are . Absolutely ; they know who the bad teachers are too , there’s very much clear ranking . And this is not ambiguous at all . </s>
The rankings are there ; we don’t use in a formal way or to make policy , but they’re ranked . </s>
I’d like to go to another question , before I do that , just for radio , I want to say the following . </s>
We are in the question and answer section of the Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . </s>
I’m John Donvan , your moderator . We have six debaters , two teams of three debating this motion : don’t blame the teachers’ unions for our failing schools . To another question right in front -- and then I’ll start moving to this side . </s>
Please rise , thank you . Intelligence Squared U.S. 27 Hi my name is Alexis Moore and I’m a sophomore at Princeton University and the vice president of Students for Education Reform . And this week , I’m here with a group of 15 undergraduates who are studying education reform here in New York City . Can you get to your question please ? </s>
Yeah . Half of us are tutoring at Paul Robison High School , which is slated for closure and last year Robison’s four year graduation was 40 percent . I really need you to get to your question . </s>
Please get to your question okay . And the UST has come out in opposition to the closure of the school which would open up new options for people in that neighborhood and those students . </s>
The question goes to the side for the motion . Why come out against the closure of a poor school ? Thank you . </s>
Thank you . Do you feel you had information or did I suppress too much ? I think none of have enough information about the specifics about this . I probably have more than the rest of us . But I don’t -- let me tell you about two other schools that I know about well . </s>
Meaning , I don’t know about Robison but I do know -- Let’s move on . With respect to your question and I did push you to cut to the chase ; I think there was information and I don’t think the panel’s familiar enough with it so I’m going to move on , but thank you very much . To this side , right down front : if you could stand please . And could you wait for just one second ; I want to make sure the camera’s on you . </s>
Okay , thank you . My name is Denise Saul and I too am a teacher . I taught in public , in private . </s>
I’d like to know how many teachers there are in New York State and how many teachers were fired this year . </s>
Randi Weingarten . </s>
How many union people -- teachers union people are in this audience ? Intelligence Squared U.S. 28 </s>
First answer the first question ; I’m going to ponder the second one . I mean I wish I was actually , so -- you want to ask . The problem I have with asking how many unionized teachers are the audience , because I’m not sure how to ask the other side of the question . And we’re open to everybody and if there’s a notion that the audience is packed , that’s not something we can control . So I’d rather not have an identification . </s>
Let me just say . Let me just say there was no attempt on any of our parts to either pack the audience or to give people invitations other than the six or ten that -- invitations that I received . So there 's no -- there was no attempt to do any of that . </s>
Now , having said that -- But there 's a suspicion , which is interesting . Well -- it 's not -- Which I think goes to the tone of where the lack of trust is . </s>
Well , but I think that the tone -- what I have experienced in terms of New York City is that in a -- most teachers right now , as we are speaking , are at home actually grading papers and marking lessons . And frankly , from my perspective when I was the teachers union president here , I never actually asked people to come or pack an audience or do these things , from my perspective . </s>
I ca n't talk for other than myself . In terms of the question about firing , what tends to happen in the teaching ranks is that there is a huge attrition rate of teachers . And so you have essentially half the new teachers within the first five to seven years actually leave the profession because it is such a tough , tough , tough place to work . And whether it 's because they do n't get the support that they need or a variety of other things , whether it 's salaries or other things , what you see is that you use both the statistics of how many people have attrited out . </s>
And in New York City last year , my understanding was that about 30 to 40 percent of the teachers , or about 30 percent of the new teachers attrited out within the first five years in terms of firing on what the statistic is . </s>
But I will tell you , in terms of the peer intervention process and program that we started in 1987 , first under my predecessor , Sandy Feldman and then myself , we actually counseled hundreds of teachers out of the profession who we thought , after we tried to help them , were not up to snuff . Intelligence Squared U.S. 29 </s>
Let me come to Larry Sand . Yeah . If you send me an email Thursday morning , I will get you an answer to your question . </s>
I 'll give you an answer to a question , though , that you did n't ask , which is how many teachers got fired in New York state -- excuse me , New York City . </s>
And in 2008 , it was 10 out of 55,000 . Does that mean that there are 54,990 competent teachers in New York ? Actually , it 's not -- Larry , that 's actually not true . </s>
There were in 19 -- in 2008 , the last year I was here , there were over a thousand teachers that were terminated for lots of different reasons . Okay , Larry , did you want to continue your point ? I want to ask you whether that question was a plant or not . I 'm joking . Do you want to continue your point ? </s>
I have very different statistics than -- I think you made it . I 'd like to go a little farther up -- black T-shirt . </s>
Can you rise and wait just a second ? You 're in a little bit of darkness , so it will take the camera a second to adjust . And they found you . Thank you . Go ahead , sir . </s>
First of all , Mr. Sputs , thanks -- Smuts , I 'm sorry . Thanks for sharing your ideas about the union in your area . I 'm thinking of changing my name to handsome genius and see if that works as well for me as it did for you . </s>
But my question is for -- for the union representatives here is , you keep making the case that we should be listening to teachers and everyone 's thinking about the best interests of the children . But should n't we be listening to parents first and not -- Absolutely . So why are you standing in the school house door and stopping parents from having the choice of where to send their children to school ? Intelligence Squared U.S. 30 </s>
Kate McLaughlin , could you take that one ? Well , and again , I firmly admit this . I am a Lowell girl , and I do n't know everything that goes on in the big wide world . But our public schools in Lowell are all choice schools . </s>
There are no neighborhood schools . We 're a city of a little over a hundred thousand people . </s>
We have 23 schools , and parents choose . It used to be based on themes , much like the magnet schools . But unfortunately with the high-stakes testing , the themes have gone to the wayside , and all of the well-meaning grants with mandates attached . </s>
So I ca n't speak to that . But the parents do have the choice . So I actually am a parent of a Lowell public school child . And I went to the central office and registered him . I put down my top three choices for schools , very much like what you 're all advocating for . </s>
And that 's our public school system , and that 's all something our union supports . My district has -- </s>
Gary Smuts . -- 29 regular K-12 , kindergarten , middle -- I mean elementary , middle and high school , one adult school . We 're schools of choice . We have one-third of our schools are magnet schools . Parents can make choices . </s>
Every school in our district has a school site council where parents are represented . The school board , parents from the district , it 's a very powerful influence in our school district , as it should be . And we -- we have board advisory committees that are made up of all parents in the district that report regularly -- </s>
Let me ask Rod Paige , what do you make of what he 's just saying now ? </s>
Well , I 'm not sure how to -- what to make of that , actually . You 're saying that choice is good . Yes . </s>
Yes . I want to hear plenty of that . Intelligence Squared U.S. 31 And we 've had choice since I was in elementary school . </s>
We all went to public schools . </s>
We also believe that public choice is good , and we have never -- I know there 's an issue here in terms of what must be going on in New York City right now because obviously feel the heat in this room about that . But ultimately , we believe in far broader choice and that every parent should have a public neighborhood school in which to send his or her kids and then ultimately have the broadest possible choices . </s>
New York City has actually the broadest high school choice program of any school district in the nation . Terry Moe . Look , this is all in code . </s>
So basically the unions are in favor of choice as long as the schools that kids can choose to move into are unionized . And so they are all in favor -- This is just true . They 're all in favor of public school choice . And that means -- what she really means is moving from one regular public school to another regular public school . </s>
They 're all unionized . </s>
They 're all under the contract . Charter schools are public schools . But the unions have done everything they can to keep the number of charter schools down everywhere . </s>
Gary Smuts , respond to that . Well , we do n't have any charters in our school district . Nobody is -- anybody that 's applied , trouble is they had n't -- the couple that did , did n't adopt the California state curriculum , and that 's a requirement in California . </s>
There 's charter schools that just started , a whole bunch up in Los Angeles . Charters in Southern California are n't that particularly -- </s>
Intelligence Squared U.S. 32 Terry 's bottom-line point was that when teachers are talking about charter schools and schools in general , they 're all for change and choice but not if the school is not unionized . Do you think that that 's a fair point ? It 's a little hard in California because we 're teacher union state . </s>
So other than Catholic schools -- </s>
Second largest system in the country . I take total exception because my issue as a union leader about charter schools , if they are public schools , and this is my experience as a teacher , and hearing from the other teachers , why is it when a child needs an outside placement that costs over a hundred thousand dollars , the charter school sends them back to the public schools to pay for . </s>
If they are a public school , that is their student . They should support him . </s>
But , Kate , to the point ; do you unions only want unionized schools ? Unions -- No , let me ask Kate because she 's in -- </s>
Sorry . </s>
-- mid flow here . As a union leader , I see what collective bargaining does for a school in a school system . </s>
Is that a `` yes '' ? Intelligence Squared U.S. 33 I -- no , it 's -- I think it 's a complicated question to answer honestly . No , to answer honestly . I believe in unionism . </s>
And I believe that -- </s>
-- a lot of the charter schools are for profit . And I think that unions help keep the ideals of American values in our schools . </s>
That is my honest answer . </s>
What is an American value ? Actually , I want to come to you , Randi , but I want to give Larry a chance just to keep this evenhanded . </s>
Now we 'll come -- In addition , you 're talking about choice . It 's very interesting . In the big cities , 40 percent of public school teachers send their own children to private schools which are not unionized . What does that tell you ? </s>
Randi Weingarten . In the United States Congress about 35 percent of United States Congress sent their children to private schools also . </s>
Randi Weingarten . I do n't . The overwhelming number of teachers opt to join a union because whether it 's in New York state or other places , everyone has a choice as to whether or not to join a union , and ultimately -- -- people -- they do . </s>
Intelligence Squared U.S. 34 Randi , Randi , Randi , Randi . </s>
Excuse me . </s>
Let 's let Randi finish her point , and I 'll come to you , Rod . Legally everyone has the choice . In New York City they have the choice . All over the country they have the choice . They may not have the choice about whether or not to pay for the services the union renders but they have the choice to join the union . </s>
And in New York City 96 percent of the people who teach in New York City opt to join the union . Now , the issue around the country -- and I believe the same way as Kate , I had lots of opportunities in my life to do lots of different things , I chose not only to be a teacher but I chose to be a union representative . I chose to do this because I believe in my heart and in my soul that what unions do for kids and for teachers as well as for working people is to lift all boats . I said this initially . I said , `` We are not perfect , just like superintendents are n't perfect , secretaries of education are n't perfect -- `` `` -- presidents of the United States of America are n't perfect , but at the end of the day , if you look at the historic record , when the unions had the kind of clout they used to have in this country , we had a vibrant middle class . '' </s>
What we are trying to do as a trade union movement is to insure that kids get the services that they need and to insure that teachers get what they need to do a good job . Terry Moe . The last part of that , can that not be true , in fact ? </s>
Because that -- </s>
But respond to her point . Well , what was the point that you want me to respond to ? Intelligence Squared U.S. 35 Which point -- </s>
Because she made a lot of points . Her last point was that creating a situation where teachers are protected and comfortable , safe , and Kate had also earlier made the point , safe from various kinds of vicissitudes of administration , that they can take chances in the classroom , that they can do all of those things , that they have some sort of protection . </s>
And there 's a logic to that , and I 'd like you to respond to it . I think that -- first of all there are laws against arbitrary treatment , against discrimination , and so on , that just apply to workers generally . And so what I would like to hear is why it is that teachers are so vulnerable to these things that they 're a special category of people in the United States , that they of all these people deserve to have a job for life , so that they ca n't be fired for incompetence . Well , teachers should n't have a job for life . And they should be fired for incompetence . </s>
The issue , and I said this a couple of months ago in a speech that neither you , nor Larry , nor Rod have actually acknowledged in the work that you 've -- or the statements you 've made today , we want to have valid and reliable evaluation systems . Teachers do not like when they are just simply thrown the keys and told , `` Do it . '' There are many of us when we first started teaching who had real frustrations in terms of not being able to connect to kids , not knowing how to do the things we needed to do . And ultimately what we 've yearned for is to have real development and evaluation programs . </s>
And , in fact , Larry , I said just two months ago , student learning must count as part of teacher evaluation , and ultimately what the ABC School District is doing , what actually the Central Falls School District was doing before the teachers were fired en masse was to try and create these evaluation systems that Arne Duncan and I have both said are really required . Terry Moe , or do you -- Terry , do you want to cede to your partner , Larry , because , Larry , I thought you had your hand up -- if I 'm wrong -- Well , I was actually -- Larry Sand . -- I was going to address another issue of Randi 's that she made earlier or -- Intelligence Squared U.S. 36 </s>
Sure . Okay -- </s>
-- just briefly what it was ? </s>
Well , she said 96 percent of teachers , I believe , choose to be in the union in New York , is that -- </s>
I 'm saying in New York City . Right -- okay . If you are interested in a real choice -- for people who do n't know , New York is a non-right to work state , which essentially means you have to join the union , as is California . That 's actually not true , Larry . Okay , let me finish , Randi , please . </s>
In California you pay $ 1,000 a year to the union . It 's actually even a little more than that . If you opt out of the union you do n't get a choice to opt in , if you opt out you get back about $ 300 dollars . $ 700 dollars still goes to the union whether you want it or not . It’s like getting a divorce from your wife that you never wanted to marry the first place and you’re still paying alimony . </s>
Let’s go to one more question . On this side , yellow shirt . And I really hope it’s good because you may be our last question . And make it a question . </s>
As everyone stated on this side of the table that the real meaning or purpose behind the unions is to look out for the kids , if something were to benefit the kids in any of your school districts , but it meant approving a salary reduction , would you vote for that salary reduction ? </s>
Intelligence Squared U.S. 37 A lot of unions have done that . And what we’re seeing is -- what we’ve seen is , I know I’ve negotiated when I was in New York City , as did my predecessor Sandy Feldman ; we negotiated deferral agreements ; we negotiated -- we just negotiated changes in pensions in order to save money for kids . </s>
I know . Okay Randi , I want to move so please state your point that the answer is yes , it does happen . Purple sweater ? </s>
I’d like to address all three , to the panel again . On which side ? Ma’am , which side ? To the side against unions . Okay . </s>
If you could discuss who are the gatekeepers to who becomes teachers , because it is not the unions . And how do you feel about charter schools using public spaces ? And Larry , Bob’s movie “The Cartel” also implicates state government , but Mr . Page , I would dare say , Mr. Bush’s friends the CTB , McGraw-Hill testing company , </s>
Okay unions . Can you rephrase your first question please ? The first on your list , can you rephrase that ? How do you feel about who are the gatekeepers to who becomes teachers ; it is not the unions . </s>
Okay , I think that’s the most relevant to our topic . Does anybody want to -- Who will be -- if you have a problem , who do you go to , is that your question ? </s>
No . Intelligence Squared U.S. 38 </s>
What’s the gatekeeper -- I don’t understand -- How do they become -- does Board of Ed let them in ? </s>
The people who are bad teachers ; some of them apparent when they go for interviews . Some of them are apparent on paper . I see -- </s>
Okay we have the question , who gets to choose who gets hired as a teacher . Are you saying if not the union or it’s not the union . It’s not the union . It’s not the union . </s>
All right I think her point is that the bad teachers aren’t because the unions are there ; the bad teachers are in the system because the school administration hired them in the first place , therefore bad teachers are not the union’s fault . </s>
Rod Page . Yes , making these decisions are really difficult decisions and we want the universities to do better . We want the administrators to do better . </s>
But once the situation has been proven , that this is a sub-par teacher , then we want to have some system to remove the teacher from the environment because we know that it’s not a good idea to have a teacher who’s not competent in front of children . That’s the only reason for that . Another question , I think we have time for one more . Green sweater . </s>
So I guess , one of them is a very quick question . Only one question . </s>
Okay . Choose . So we talked a lot about unions defending teachers who we thought were less than competent . Is it the fault of the union that they’re defending them and availing them of Intelligence Squared U.S. 39 their rights or that there’s a system that means that they’re actually successful at doing so ? I actually didn’t understand the question . </s>
But I think there’s something there and I want to make sure our audience -- I guess the question would be , we don’t blame defense lawyers for defending their clients because we have a judicial system that allows for prosecutors and defense lawyers . Similarly , should we blame unions for defend -- for availing themselves of their rights to defend their constituents and not -- Let me that . </s>
And I thank you for that question because that was the biggest myth for me as a new teacher . I too thought oh , teachers unions keep bad teachers around them . As I became a building rep and now the vice president , I’ve seen these cases actually pan out . </s>
And it’s exactly what you said ; due process is not an easy thing to defend to people . And it’s like you said , I mean the defense lawyer didn’t murder the person . But somehow it seems that unions are taking the rap for the actions of someone else when they’re actually defending the due process . And in the actual case , I’ll give you an example , this is what floored me when I learned about this . </s>
Can I just say one thing ? You can’t grieve opinion . So in the case of a principal writing something , and giving a teacher an unsatisfactory -- teachers unions can only talk about the procedures that happened . We actually ca n't defend the work of a bad teacher . Larry Sand . </s>
We defend procedure which is exactly -- Point made . And Larry Sand . </s>
Okay . </s>
Very quickly , to answer your question , sir , yeah , they act as defense lawyers . </s>
I agree with you . But they also make the rules . They make the laws . So it seems to me to be a conflict of interest . Intelligence Squared U.S. 40 </s>
And that concludes round two of our debate . </s>
Okay . Here 's where we are . We are about to hear brief closing statements from each of our debaters . </s>
They will get two minutes each . After that , you will be asked to vote on where you stand on the motion . This will be your last chance . This will be their last chance to change your minds on our motion , which is do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools . </s>
We asked you to vote before the debate began , and reminding you of the results we got , the motion , do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools . </s>
Those for the motion who stand by teachers unions : 24 percent . Those against the motion , who blame teachers unions : 43 percent . Those undecided were 33 percent . We will ask you to vote once again and pick the winner right after the closing statements which will begin now as we start round three , closing statements , two minutes each . </s>
And to lead off against the motion : Larry Sand , retired teacher and president of the California Teachers Empowerment Network . Okay , thank you , John . And thank you , Mr. Rosenkranz , I think this is a wonderful forum , and I 'm very appreciative to be a part of it . </s>
Yesterday , March 15th was a day of reckoning for many teachers across the country . In a bad economy , that 's when the letters of possible layoffs also known as RIFs , reduction in force notices , go out to all teachers -- go out to teachers who might be losing their job . In my school 's retirement lunch last June -- there were more than retirees saying goodbye . We lost several of the hardest working , most effective and popular young teachers on campus . </s>
Several teachers -- we all know who they are . The kids know , the parents know , the teachers know -- should have been the ones saying goodbye . </s>
But because of the union mandated seniority rules , they were n't . As a parent , a grandparent or just a fair-minded person , do n't you want your child , any child , to be taught by the best teacher , not the longest employed teacher ? Of course you do . </s>
But that is not what happened in my school and other schools around the country . Yes , the teachers unions are not the only problems with public education today , but the extent of the damage they have caused can not be exaggerated . In closing , to show you how the twisted the situation really is , what could be more preposterous than this : They go to great lengths to keep the misdirected and other sexual predators in the classroom . The union hounded Jaime Escalante , one of the greatest teachers of our time , out of the classroom and more recently destroyed the hopes and dreams of thousands of poor children in Washington , D.C . Please join us in sending the teachers unions a resounding message and vote no on your ballot . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Larry Sand . Our motion is do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools . And summarizing his position for the possession motion standing by teachers Intelligence Squared U.S. 41 unions is Gary Smuts who is superintendent of the ABC United school district in California . </s>
ABC Unified . Pardon me . Let me reintroduce it so I have it correct . </s>
Did I say ABC news ? It comes out sometimes . Gary Smuts , superintendent of the ABC united school district in California . Did I get it wrong again ? You got it wrong again , but that 's okay . </s>
You know why , because I 'm reading incorrect copy . ABC Unified School District . We were separate school districts . </s>
We all came together . </s>
All right . </s>
Superintendent of the ABC Unified School District in California . Thank you . Thanks for the correction . Accountability , innovation , standards , high achievement , teacher training , teacher performance measured by student achievement , these are hallmarks of the modern teachers union . Now some teachers unions are n't modern . </s>
But those that are do these things . It is implied that the teachers union or non- unionon is the only veritable here . And they 've tried to use weasel words to get out of that . Oh , not all of them or some of them . </s>
But the case is if you look at the proposition , you have to blame teachers unions , I guess in each and every case . You have to deny poverty , poor budgets , lack of parental support , poor boards , poor state leadership , poor superintendent . You have to say none of those things count and only teachers union counts . They know that 's not true , and they 've said so . So you ca n't blame -- just blame teachers unions . </s>
And you know that . </s>
There 's a lot reasons schools do n't work . And it 's not just teachers unions . </s>
Professor Moe said that teachers unions are major obstacles to school improvement . Everywhere ? </s>
Not in my district . So the proposition is n't true in my district . It is n't true in Kate 's district . </s>
It is n't true in a lot of districts . And you 've got to be fair about that . </s>
It 's not true in a lot of school districts . Professor Moe pointed out that principals , 90 percent of them said they ca n't get rid of bad teachers . </s>
That 's not a very good system . Why not work with teachers unions to get rid of bad teachers ? That 's what Randi Weingarten wants to do . Magnet schools work better than charters . I 'm all for magnet schools . </s>
But the AFT 's not against magnet -- charter schools , either . Larry Sand told us a lot of stories from band camp . I do n't think that that 's a good reason to say teachers unions are bad , by sharing horror stories from individual places throughout the United States . Being a superintendent is a hot , sweaty business . And it 's hard enough Intelligence Squared U.S. 42 doing it by yourself . </s>
But I 'd much rather work as a superintendent with my colleagues from the American Federation of Teachers to increase student achievement . Thank you , Gary Smuts . Our motion is do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools . Here to argue against the motion , blaming teachers unions is Rod Paige , former US secretary of education and cofounder of the Chartwell Education Group . Well , I think I want to be clear . </s>
We all know that teachers unions are not solely to blame for our failing schools . We would never argue that . What we are arguing is the way the motion is put , that the only option that you have in order to express the idea that teachers unions bear significant responsibility for the inability to reform our schools now . And so we are encouraging you to vote no . Teacher unions draw the ability to serve , to protect the interest of their members from their ability to convince the public that they are really about the kids . </s>
They are very good at hiding their real intent . They draw their power and ability to get the public to believe that there are some persons in some groups that they are not . They are not who they say they are . </s>
Who they say they are is not who they really are . </s>
Who they really are are mammoth organizations , highly financed , the most powerful political organizations in the United States of America . So you need to see them in that way . And we think they deserve your vote against the motion because they do bear significant responsibility for the condition of our schools . </s>
Thank you , Rod Paige . Summarizing for the motion standing up for teachers unions and arguing against our motion , do n't blame teachers unions for -- I 'm sorry , arguing for our motion , do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools , Kate McLaughlin , an elementary teacher in Lowell , Massachusetts , who is executive vice president of the United Teachers of Lowell , No . 495 , which is a local of the AFT . </s>
Thank you . It 's interesting because I ca n't help but take this personally because I am a union leader , and I am a proud union member . And I 'm telling that you I 'm speaking with the utmost candor that the kids come first to me and to my union president . </s>
The unions are the members , the people in the union , they are not these powerful organizations that secretary Paige will have you believe . Yes , there are -- there are political implications to what we do because we are advocating for the things that our children need ; stable housing , healthcare and access to great and wonderful schools . So I would ask that you see the people on this panel as people who are actually doing this work on the ground level and working with our administrations to make our school systems better . We are the conduit for our teachers . </s>
Our teachers tell us what they need in their classrooms , and Intelligence Squared U.S. 43 we collect this information , and we work together with our superintendent and other central office personnel to make it happen . That is the purpose of the United Teachers of Lowell . There are other aspects to what we do , yes . </s>
We protect due process rights , yes . That is one area . But what we do is maintain an attractive profession so that we can get the very best teachers teaching in our schools for the benefit of the students . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Kate McLaughlin . Arguing against the motion ; arguing that teachers unions are at fault : Terry Moe , the William Bennett Monroe professor of political science at Stanford University and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution . Well , I think it 's important here at the end to just focus on the big picture . </s>
And the big picture is very simple , and it 's very devastating . Here is what it comes down to . The teachers unions are by far the most powerful groups in American education . </s>
And they use their power mainly to protect jobs . </s>
And what they say is that there is really no conflict between protecting jobs and doing what 's best for kids . But there are conflicts , lots of them , and as a result we ca n't get bad teachers out of the classroom , the schools are burdened with truly perverse organizations , and fundamental reforms , good reforms that make sense for kids , are resisted and undermined and weakened . </s>
So these are just basic facts . Our opponents say that they want reforms too , that they want to get bad teachers out of the classroom . We 've heard that several times that they want choice , that they want accountability , and my response is , `` Hey , it 's 2010 . </s>
Where’ve you been ? If you wanted to get bad teachers out of the classroom , why did n't you do it 30 years ago ? Why do we have all these protections and state laws ? Why were n't they aggressive about it 30 years ago ? Why are we even talking about it now ? '' </s>
Same thing with choice and accountability , they could have been aggressive in supporting these things , pushing for more choice , pushing for accountability . The reason we do n't have them is that they 've been opposing them . </s>
So again , what counts is not what you say , it 's what you do . So here 's the bottom line . </s>
You have an opportunity to show tonight where you stand , and so you can send a message about this issue to the unions and you can send a message to the nation as a whole . So please do that . Please vote , `` No , '' on this proposal . It 's important . </s>
Thank you , Terry Moe . Our motion is , “Do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools , '' and finally , to argue for that motion , standing by the teachers , Randi Weingarten , President of the American Federation of Teachers , the country 's second largest teachers ' union . </s>
Intelligence Squared U.S. 44 When I think about what we 're doing here tonight , I do n't think about it as a debate on this motion and who wins or loses this motion . </s>
I think about the kids that I taught at Clara Barton High School . </s>
I think about the millions of kids in this country who , but for public education , will not have a chance at life . </s>
I think about the thousands and thousands of teachers who are isolated in individual classrooms and who , frankly , have no interest in the status quo and who join a union or stay in a union because they want voice in how their kids get a decent education . I have been in three schools a week when I was the president of the United Teachers in New York City . And I have been in over 50 places in the United States in the last year and a half since I 've been the President of the American Federation of Teachers . I wish I had that magic wand that would magically help all of our students achieve to the global standards we wish right now . </s>
But I can tell you , the folks who are on the other side of the stage and the folks in the audience , that this union , under our watch , and you see the examples from both what Gary said , who happens to be the Superintendent of the Year in California , as well as what Kate says , who every single day is teaching children as well as doing her union work , we want what children need , we want to make every single school a school where parents want to send their kids and educators want to work , and we 've learned a heck of a lot in the last few years about what works for kids , how to insure that we have well supported and well prepared teachers even if we have to do the hard work of saying to people , `` You do n't belong in this profession , '' how to have an engaged curriculum , how to work with parents better , and how to make sure that kids have the decent services that they need . Randi Weingarten , your time is up . </s>
What we 're asking -- Thank you very much . And that concludes this symposium . </s>
And now it 's time to learn which side has argued best . </s>
We 're going to ask you right now to go to the keypads at your seat . It will register your vote . </s>
And we 're going to get the readout almost instantaneously . Our motion is , `` Do n't blame teachers unions for our failing schools . '' If you are for the motion , if you stand with teachers ' unions or at least do n't blame them , push number one . If you are against the motion , you do blame teachers ' unions , press number two . And if you are undecided , remain undecided , or became undecided , push number three . </s>
And while that 's happening , and while the votes are being locked in and tabulated , the first thing I want to do is thank our panel for an amazingly impassioned and informed debate . You all are terrific . </s>
Thank you . Intelligence Squared U.S. 45 I 'd also like to thank those in the audience who came up with questions , even those that we did n't use or that got chopped . We seriously appreciate your willingness to be involved in this and for all of you for voting and for being part of the evening , very vocally in fact . </s>
So we’ll hear of the vote result shortly . A few things I want to announce about what’s upcoming . Our next debate will be on Tuesday , the 13th of April . </s>
Our motion is : organic food is marketing hype . Panelists for the motion are the director of the center for global food issues , Dennis Avery ; Missouri farmer Blake Hurst and former chairman of the U.K.’s food standards agency , Lord John Krebs .

If you’re voting for this motion , you’re standing with teachers unions or at least not blaming them . If you are against the motion , you do blame teachers unions for the failure of our schools .

After the debate , 25 percent are for , 68 percent against , and 7 percent undecided . The side against the motion wins . Congratulations to them ; thank you to all of you from me , John Donvan , and Intelligence Squared U.S . Thank you . I guess we’d like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for making this all possible . </s>
Well , welcome everyone to another debate from Intelligence Squared , U.S. I’m John Donvan of ABC News and again , it is my honor to be serving as moderator . As the four debaters you see sharing the stage with me at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . Four debaters , two against two , will be debating this motion : Treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals . Now , this is a debate ; there will be a winner and a loser , and you our audience will be serving as the judges . </s>
By the time the debate has ended , we will have asked you to vote twice , once both before the debate and once again after you have heard the argument . And the team that has changed the most minds , once we see where you stand on the motion , that team will be declared our winner . And as this is a debate , everything is fair and robust , we just ask these debaters to bring intelligence and wit and humor and charm -- I think you have that going for you as well . But mostly intelligence ; we want this to be a high level , smart debate , and that’s why we have all of you here as well when you participate in the middle session . So , onto the voting to establish where you in the audience stand before the debate begins . </s>
You have at your seat , the keypad that will help you register your position on this motion . </s>
Treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals . </s>
If you agree with this motion , push number one . If you disagree , push number two . And if you are undecided , push number three . We will register this vote and at the end of the debate , the team that has changed the most minds when you vote again will be declared our winner , with the motion being , “treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals.” So on to the debate , round one , opening statements by each debater in turn . </s>
They will speak for seven minutes each uninterrupted . </s>
Our motion is : “treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals.” And I would like to introduce our first debater arguing for this motion , Marc Thiesson who is a columnist for the Washington Post . He’s also a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , a former speechwriter for President George W. Bush . He came out with a book this year that was a stiff defense of the interrogation methods used by the CIA throughout the war on terror and it sold really , really well actually , Marc , congratulations to you . </s>
So a lot of people liked it , your critics don’t like it . </s>
They -- I think Jane Mayer of the New Yorker calls it the bible for the torture apologist . Is that fair ? </s>
No , not at all . Okay . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen -- I’m surprised you said that . Marc Thiessen . Thank you , John . </s>
I want to thank Mr. Rosenkranz for inviting Mike Hayden and I to the only debate we could possibly win in Greenwich Village . We just marked , as Mr. Rosenkranz said , the anniversary of September 11th , 2001 . I’d like to start by asking members of the audience a question . </s>
With a show of hands , how many of you remember exactly where you were when the attacks of September 11th happened ? </s>
Let the record show it’s everybody . Okay . </s>
I want you to think back to that time . I want you to think back to the scenes of burning rubble . I want you to think back to the shock that you felt at the ability of the terrorists to penetrate our defenses and launch such an attack like that in our midst . </s>
And the questions we were all asking . Who had attacked us ? What do they want ? </s>
Were there more attacks coming ? </s>
If I had told you back then that we would go almost a decade without another terrorist attack , who would have believed me ? Very few , I think , a few . Most of thought it was going to be the first of many attacks . </s>
I was in the Pentagon on September 11th , 2001 . </s>
I was blessed not to be not at the point of impact , but I was a few corridors down and I remember feeling the building shudder ; I remember the smell of the smoke in the hallways . And the one thing I remember very distinctly is that the alarms never went off , the evacuation alarms . We all just sort of filed out of the building and went on out to the lawn and looked back at the broken and burning Pentagon . </s>
But in the months that followed , the alarms went off a bunch of times as false reports of impending attacks , planes that were headed our way kept coming in . And every time , the whole building , we would all evacuate and go out on the lawn and look up at the sky , waiting for the attack that never came . </s>
Why did that attack never come ? I would submit to you there are only two possibilities . Either the terrorists lost interest in attacking us again , or we found out what their plans were and stopped them from carrying them out . </s>
Mike Hayden and I will argue tonight that the latter is the case . We will argue that the reason that attack did not happen is because we abandoned the law enforcement approach to terrorism that failed to stop the 1992 World Trade Center bombing , that failed to stop the attack on the embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , that failed to stop the attack on the USS Cole , that failed to stop the attacks of 9/11 . That we abandoned that approach and began to treat terrorists as enemy combatants and not criminals . In those early days after 9/11 , we knew almost nothing about the enemy who had attacked us . We did not know that Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was the mastermind of 9/11 ; he wasn’t even on our charts . </s>
And we didn’t know who his accomplices were . And unbeknownst to us , there were two terrorist networks out there , at large , planning new attacks . The KSM network that had planned and carried out 9/11 , and the Hambali network which was a Southeast Asian terrorist that KSM had organized because he knew we’d be on the lookout for Arab men . And those terror networks were in the advanced stages of planning a series of attacks including a plot to blow up high-rise apartment buildings in the United States using natural gas , a plot to repeat 9/11 in Europe by flying airplanes into Heathrow Airport in downtown London , a plot to blow up the U.S. consulate in Karachi and western residences in Karachi , an al-Qaeda cell that was developing anthrax for attacks inside the United States and a cell , the Garaba cell , the southeast Asians who KSM had tasked to fly an airplane into the tallest building in the west coast , the Library Tower in Los Angeles . </s>
We did not know any of this , not a word . We didn’t know who those people were , what they had planned . And then we started capturing terrorists . </s>
Abu Zubaydah , Ramzi Binalshibh , KSM , and they provided us information that allowed us to round up and dismantle both of those terror networks . When KSM was captured and brought into custody , he was asked about upcoming attacks . You know what he said ? </s>
I’ll tell you everything when I get to New York and see my lawyer . Ladies and gentlemen , our opponents tonight would have granted that request . </s>
And if we had listened to their advice , if we had told KSM you have the right to remain silent , there would be craters in the ground in Los Angeles and Karachi and London and other cities in this country because of the attack that we did not stop . This debate is about more than Miranda rights . </s>
The Obama administration had eliminated the CIA program , but at least they’re killing terrorists using predator drones , right ? No , no , no say our opponents , that’s illegal too . The ACLU and Center for Constitutional Rights filed a lawsuit a couple weeks ago saying that because terrorists outside of Iraq and Afghanistan are criminals and not enemy combatants , we can not kill terrorists in those areas using predator drones . So if you believe that we should not kill terrorists using predator drones , then vote for them . The fact is that that program has killed half the al-Qaeda leadership and it is probably the only thing standing between us and another 9/11 . </s>
One final point , our opponents are going to try to turn this into a debate on waterboarding . I’m happy to have that debate . As John pointed out , I wrote a book defending it . But if they’re arguing about waterboarding , they’re losing and I’ll tell you why . </s>
It is a little known fact -- how many people think Barack Obama ended waterboarding ? He didn’t . </s>
My debate partner Mike Hayden ended waterboarding . When Mike Hayden handed over the CIA program to Barack Obama , the techniques involved were the tummy slap , the facial hold , mild sleep deprivation and a diet of liquid Ensure . I’m sure the makers of liquid Ensure will be thrilled to know that their product is torture . Bottom line is , there is a wide area between waterboarding on one hand and telling KSM and other terrorists , you have the right to remain silent . </s>
So you can be against waterboarding and for the proposition , that we should treat terrorists as criminals , as -- before the proposition , we should treat terrorists as enemy combatants and not criminals . So finally I’d just like to ask you , keep in mind , if you would like to keep killing terrorists with predator drones , if you would like -- if you think that our first priority in the war on terror , when we capture a terrorist should be interrogating them for intelligence , not obtaining evidence for prosecution ; if you want to continue the approach to counterterrorism that has prevented us from being struck again as we were on 9/11 , then I ask you to vote for our position . If you would like to eliminate all those tools , I suggest you vote for the other side and find a safe place to hide . Thank you . </s>
Our motion is “treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals.” We have heard the opening statement by the side for the motion and now to speak first against the motion , I’d like to introduce David Frakt who is a Lieutenant Colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserve JAG Corps . </s>
That means he’s a lawyer in the military . He served as lead defense counsel at the Office of Military Commissions . </s>
He represented detainees at Guantanamo . His most famous case is that of the teenager who was released finally after you made the case that his interrogation had been conducted improperly . He went home . David , I know you did him -- it worked out well for him . </s>
Is it your view that works out well for the United States ? </s>
Absolutely . Anytime an innocent man is released , that’s a very positive thing . </s>
And I -- it wasn’t my advocacy that got him out . Actually the Department of Justice , after seven years , acknowledged that actually he was not an enemy combatant , and so he was sent home and it was a great day for America . Ladies and gentlemen , David Frakt . Thank you . </s>
It’s a privilege to be here and against such august opposition . I’m going to start by disagreeing , and it’s probably not a good idea to disagree with your host , but Mr. Rosenkranz made a comment in his opening remarks that the criminal justice is about punishing criminals after the fact . </s>
And that’s a notion I would like to disabuse our audience of because the criminal justice system is much more robust than that . </s>
It’s there -- our law enforcement and working hand in hand with intelligence , is there to detect crime before it happens , to infiltrate terrorist networks , to deter attacks . And we don’t have to wait for a crime to be completed before stepping in . we’ve seen it over and over again where the police or the FBI or New York , NYPD breaks up a terrorist cell or just discovers a plot in progress or conspiracy , and those people can be arrested . They can be interrogated by law enforcement , and in those interrogations yield a lot of information . </s>
There’s this perception somehow that reading people Miranda rights automatically means that they’re never going to talk again . And it’s true that sometimes when advised to the right to an attorney and the right to remain silent , that people clam up , but not always . In fact quite often , they divulge a lot of information . And so we’re able to charge people with attempting crimes , with conspiracies to commit crimes and put a lot of terrorists away . In fact , since 9/11 we -- the federal -- and talking only about federal prosecutions , over 400 terrorists have been locked up for an average of 20 years apiece . </s>
Now contrast that with Guantanamo , which started with -- or at its peak had 787 detainees . Of course -- and all of whom were at one time accused of being enemy combatants . The Bush administration ended up releasing over two-thirds of those when they realized they had no evidence against the vast majority of them . Another 100 were cleared for release before President Obama took over . Another 100 have been cleared for release now . </s>
So what’s the scorecard now ? </s>
We have four detainees who have been prosecuted successfully in military commission : four convictions versus 400 . The Obama administration after a year-long review determined that there were 35 detainees that should be tried in some criminal form and there’s another 48 that they say are too dangerous . So we’re talking about 83 people , after seven or eight years that they’ve decided are really the bad guys . And this is the danger of simply labeling people with -- as enemy combatants . And you have to think about the implications of what is being proposed here because as a whole -- and Mr. Thiessen acknowledged it -- they want to go back to the program of the prior administration . </s>
And what did that entail ? It entailed locking people up indefinitely without charge , without access to courts , without access to counsel , subjecting them to a full range of interrogation techniques , many of which are abhorrent to American values . And they were not given the opportunity to defend themselves , to even find out what the basis for their detention was . </s>
And that’s the system that Mr. Thiessen would like to return to . And I think it’s a fundamentally un-American system . Terrorists are criminals , nothing more . It may be that they have particularly grandiose criminal plans . But by labeling them as combatants , we actually legitimize them . </s>
We elevate their status to a warrior status which is what they seek . And we engage in a war on their terms . </s>
And I don’t think that’s a good idea . Let me pose a question . </s>
Mr. Thiessen posed a question to you and he talked about the fact that there hasn’t been any attacks as if this is proof that those methods , the illegal interrogation methods and treating people as enemy combatants worked and that’s the reason we didn’t have any attacks . Let me tell you why we didn’t have any attacks . And of course there were a number of attempted attacks . But the reason is because we entered into -- by treating terrorism primarily as a military problem , as a war , we started two voluntary , unnecessary wars , in Afghanistan and Iraq , and we presented the terrorists with hundreds of thousands of targets , American soldiers . And as bad as 9/11 was , and 3,000 people died on that day , but we have lost 5700 American service members dead . </s>
Another 1100 coalition members dead in Iraq and Afghanistan and 39,000 American service members injured . </s>
It’s basically revived the Veterans Administration Hospitals because we have a whole generation of wounded warriors out there who have been fighting wars that really aren’t necessary . And are we safer ? That’s the question you really have to ask . </s>
Are we safer after eight years of this approach ? </s>
Ask yourself this question . Are there more people in the world -- according to Mr. Thiessen , there were two little terrorist cells of al-Qaeda after 9/11 . How many terrorists are there right now in the world or violent jihadists who are willing to strap a bomb to their bodies and kill Americans , or plant roadside bombs ? We have essentially launched a global war -- and that’s what we called it , the global war on terror that the Islamic world interpreted it as a war on them and we have alienated tens and hundreds of millions of people unnecessarily . And we are not safer . </s>
We are not safer when we abandon our core values . </s>
And that’s ostensibly -- they use coded language but that’s what they’re talking about because they’re talking about not using law enforcement methods , not using traditional tools . They want a world of perfect security where no crimes are ever committed , where no terrorists attack . That’s never going to happen . And when you seek , strive for that , we end up with a police state . </s>
The safest country in the world is North Korea , but we don’t want to live in North Korea . David Frakt , thank you very much . At this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate our motion is “treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals.” </s>
We have heard from the first two debaters arguing for and against this motion . Now our third debater to argue for the motion , I’d like to introduce Michael Hayden ; he is a retired four star Air Force general and former director of the CIA . And Michael , when you took over the interrogation program of the CIA that had been in place , had just about been called to a halt under political pressure and other complaints , you decided to take a look at it again , commissioned your own review , which you undertook personally , and you concluded what ? </s>
I spent the whole summer of 2006 getting what I would call a graduate degree on the CIA Interrogation and Detention Program . I was a blank slate ; I had no vested interest in what had gone on before . I could have chosen any course of action . At the end of the summer , I went to President Bush and said I wanted to make some modifications to the program , but as Marc has suggested , I could not in conscience , given my responsibility of the CIA to defend the republic , take this program off the table for him or for any future president . He needed this . </s>
In conscience I could not just say make it go away . It would have been a comfortable decision , John . </s>
It probably would have gotten credit in some circles , but it would have been immoral . Ladies and gentleman , Michael Hayden . Well , I think Marc and David have kind of teed up the question pretty nicely for us here . </s>
Are we a nation at war or are we not ? Should we perceive ourselves to be at war or should we not ? David said that our adversary in this thing out there , war or not , are criminals and nothing more . </s>
But if that’s the case , let me take you back almost a year to the day to the Horn of Africa , to Somalia , to American Navy SEAL , in a helicopter , a Seahawk , coming off a Navy carrier in the Indian Ocean , going after an individual named Sullah Nabhan , at the time was the leader of al-Qaeda in Somalia , al-Qaeda in the Horn of Africa . We killed him . We landed long enough to swab up portions of his remain to get DNA evidence that we had killed him . I wasn’t in the mission , I was out of government at this time , I wasn’t privy to the pre-brief . But I know what was asked by the field commander before he got on the helicopter . </s>
Sir , is this a kill or a capture ? And it’s very clear from what happened , he was told this is a kill . </s>
No probable cause , no warrant , no court . </s>
Because we are a nation at war and Saleh Ali Nabhan was part of an opposing armed enemy force . I became an advocate ; my epiphany that we are a nation at war took place about 10 minutes after 10:00 , September 11th , 2001 . </s>
It became clear to me at that point and I believe in few things more firmly than I believe in the fact that we are a nation at war . President Obama has said we are a nation at war . </s>
President Bush has said we are a nation at war . </s>
In March of 2007 , I went to the German residence to give a talk to all the ambassadors to the United States from the nations of the European Union . </s>
And Germany was in the chair of the E.U . ; they were inviting these ambassadors in ; they invited an American to come in and kind of be the lunchtime entertainment . Bob Gates was there at one point , Condi Rice at another ; this was my turn and I decided to say something interesting . I decided to talk our European friends about rendition , detention and interrogation . I had a wonderful speechwriting staff at CIA , but this was a speech that I took a personal hand at . </s>
On page two of that speech , I simply said to our European friends , let me tell you what I believe , what my agency believes , what I believe my country believes . We are a nation at war . We are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates . This war is global in scope and I can only fulfill my legal and moral responsibilities to the citizens of my republic by taking this fight to this enemy wherever he may be . </s>
A year ago last August , August of 2009 I was in Phoenix . President Obama was addressing the VFW . He said quite clearly we are at war ; we are at war with al-Qaeda and its affiliates . Now I know most of the American population doesn’t sense they are at war . </s>
I know that . The American Armed Forces know that we are . </s>
The American security establishment knows that we are . </s>
The American intelligence community knows that we are . You , your political processes have sent me , a career military officer , the director the CIA to war . You have told me to defend you . Do not take away from me the tools that I need to perform the service you demand . At some point in our conversation tonight , there will be a discussion here about we need to uphold the rule of law . </s>
I could not agree more . It just matters what model of law we are committed to upholding . Is this an issue best addressed through American criminal law or is this an issue best addressed through the laws of armed conflict ? I submit to you that it’s only the laws of armed conflict that will keep you safe . </s>
This isn’t theoretical for me ; this was real . I had a meeting with my general counsel and his team at CIA about two years ago . </s>
I said to the team , our enemy is opening a new front . They are beginning to attack us , with attack in quotes , it’s a bit metaphorical . They are beginning to attack us in the American legal system . </s>
We have to best them in the legal system the way we are defeating them in the tribal region of Pakistan . And I told my lawyers , I want you to lean as far forward and the hardest as you possibly can in terms of giving information to our court system . I want blood on the harness , you are leaning so far forward . </s>
We worked our tails off in those judicial processes , specifically habeas corpus . When we got a point where we could go no farther , one of the judges demanded that we provide not him , but the defendant , the name and the identity of the intelligence source we had used in order to determine that he was a member of al-Qaeda . I know you don’t live in the world I used to live in , but there is nothing that a director of CIA could do in those circumstances . You can not let the world know that sources who risk everything , who risk all to work for you , will have their names revealed in the American judicial process , to the individual they have identified as al-Qaeda . The Christmas attack is another little morality play . </s>
It really demonstrates the fallacy of treating this as a law enforcement matter . When Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab attempted to down an American aircraft , he was a member of al-Qaeda ; he was an enemy combatant . It was an attack mounted from outside the United States towards and in the United States . And because of a law enforcement mentality , we sent a clean team in there . </s>
A clean team ; that is somebody in the FBI who knew nothing of what Abdulmutallab had told us . After only 50 minutes of interrogation , every known al- Qaeda aircraft attack this country has involved multiple threats of attack : 9/11 , 2006 from London , the Bojinka plot over the Pacific . And yet after 50 minutes , our instincts were so strong to the law enforcement that we allowed him to lawyer up . That’s unconscionable . </s>
That’s a terrible decision . It is based upon a model that you know , he’s just a criminal and we just need to make sure we get him in jail . That’s not the objective here . The objective is to keep you safe . </s>
Thank you very much . Our motion is “treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals , ” and finally to speak against the motion , I’d like to introduce Stephen Jones who is an attorney from the Midwest , from Oklahoma I believe , managing partner of the law firm Jones , Otjen , and Davis . He has also defended a well-known terrorist , but not from the Middle East . </s>
He defended Timothy McVeigh , the Oklahoma City bomber . And you were a public defender in that role , so you were assigned to him and he to you . I’m curious , did you want that case when it came to you ? Well , I wasn’t the public defender ; I wasn’t even on the panel ; I was appointed as lawyer by the judges in the federal courts in Oklahoma City . </s>
And did you want the case ? Well , when the judge or judges ask you to take a case , what you want or don’t want is not relevant . Ladies and gentlemen , Stephen Jones . First of all , let me tell you that I am a Republican and I voted for George Bush both times , and I voted for John McCain and yes , Sarah Palin , and I don’t apologize for that . I don’t think the argument here is political . </s>
I think the argument is constitutional and it basically boils down to how far we are willing to sacrifice our ideals , our history , our beliefs as a nation for security . And is that security real or temporary ? Has the target of our adversaries simply moved offshore , much like banking and investment , or is the target here ? For various law enforcement agencies and members of the national intelligence establishment who have protected us and work long and devoted hours , there can be no criticism . But that’s hardly the issue , nor frankly is the ACLU the issue . </s>
The issue quite simply is whether we are a nation of laws , and there are three reasons , compelling reasons why you should vote against this resolution and vote no . The first is that the United States of America did not happen accidentally . There was a political deal , a bargain . </s>
The bargain was this ; that the twelve states that participated in the Philadelphia Convention would surrender some of their rights which they held very importantly , to a central government that they had no experience with . And in return for that surrender of their rights to that central government , that government would , as its first order of business , pass a series of amendments of the Constitution to restrict the power of that government which they had agreed to join . So the right , the freedom of speech , freedom of assembly , the right to petition , redress of grievances , the right to a fair trial , to due process , to protection against self-incrimination , to the assistance of counsel , to be safe and secure unless a warrant is issued by law enforcement to search it , the right to a public trial , the right to a speedy trial . </s>
For all of those , are in the first 10 amendments . And the bargain was redeemed . </s>
And 100 years later , or almost 100 years later , that bargain was purchased and redeemed by the blood of more Americans who died in the Civil War than all the other wars . By the Civil War , President Lincoln’s address at Gettysburg and the passage of the 14th amendment , we as a nation reaffirmed the ideal which is due process of law , equal protection of all people under the Constitution . Not something that we always follow , and there have been black holes in our history , but that is our ideal ; that is the American experience : a written Constitution that limits the power of government . Secondly , the United States is , for millions , hundreds of millions of people in the world , their ideal . One of our presidents once referred to a letter by one of the early English governors , that United States is a city upon a hill . </s>
Well it is a city upon a hill and what makes us special is that we try , every day and in every way , most of us , to uphold those ideals . And if we were to surrender even temporarily those ideals , if we were willing to say , to these individuals who are charged , charged not convicted , charged with terrorist offenses , that we will be like Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the early ‘70s and we will suspend these basic rights , these things that our national experience have taught us , we would lose many of the allies , supporters , and people who in their hearts look at the United States . And finally , having represented a terrorist -- and before 9/11 , the Oklahoma City bombing was the greatest act of domestic terrorism in this country . 168 people dead , 19 of them children under the age of six . </s>
Eight federal law enforcement agents , over a billion dollars of uninsured damages , 500 people seriously injured and 30,000 who sought and received mental or emotional intervention because of their disturbances . But Tim McVeigh was tried and convicted before a jury in a federal court . He had lawyers ; he got a change of venue ; he got a severance ; he got the money through the federal system to pay his lawyers , to investigate the case and bring witnesses to Denver , Colorado even in the last days of that trial , the G-7 summit was meeting in Denver . </s>
But in our country , our security forces , our law enforcement was able to provide both a fair trial for Tim McVeigh and protect the world’s leaders meeting five miles away . Now , ladies and gentlemen , the courts are a sanctuary in the jungle ; that’s what they are . They are to determine justice is blind ; we don’t have a special court for people we call a terrorist . We don’t have a special criminal court for drug dealers ; we don’t have a special criminal court for murderers or people who commit other crimes , whether serious or small . We have a federal judicial system and a state judicial system and then for the armed forces , the uniform code of military justice . </s>
Because 200 years national experience has taught us that our safety comes just as much from adherence to the rule of law as it does to the talents of our intelligence agencies and our law enforcement agencies . The history of our country is on the side that Dave and I represent . And I urge you to vote no and to affirm the rule of law , regardless of how despicable persons may be . For in the final analysis the justice of a society is measured by how it treats its worst , not its best . I’m John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
I’m host and moderator for this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York City at NYU . We’re on a stage surrounded by several hundred of you in the audience and on our stage , four debaters , two against two debating this motion : treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals . The team arguing for the motion include a former CIA director and a speechwriter for the Bush administration , now an author . They are arguing that we are in a war and that in war for the sake for security and survival , we may need , we have to at times undertake unpleasant actions . It may even be the moral thing to do . Their opponents include two attorneys , one who works for the military and one who defended Tim McVeigh , and they argued that terrorists are nothing more than criminals . </s>
And to treat them as more than criminals actually does them a favor . </s>
We are now into round two and I want to at this point , invite you into the debate . In a few minutes I’ll come to you for questions but in this part of the debate , the debaters can address one another directly and also will take questions from me . And my first question is actually to the side arguing against the motion . </s>
Your opponents include a former director of the CIA , a speechwriter for the Bush Administration who wrote the president’s speech in which he discussed these issues and he was briefed , as he tells us extensively on how the system actually works and what it actually produced . And they are painting a very dire picture . And my question to you , their opponents , is whether they may just know more than you do ? David Frakt . </s>
Well , I would hate to concede that , and I would note that I do have a top secret FBI clearance , but I did not get the opportunity to see much of the intelligence that would have come across the desk of general Hayden . I would hope that that intelligence did not come across the desk of Marc Thiessen . But -- but some of it somehow seems to have gotten its way into his book . So maybe we ought to be investigating that . But -- </s>
The person you 'd be investigating is Barack Obama , who released it . Back to David Frakt . </s>
I 'm sorry . One of the things that I want to -- </s>
Well , no , I 'm asking the question in a serious way , that you -- so you hear the director of the CIA , said this was on me . This was my responsibility . Not that I love doing these things or any of us love doing it , but I saw the impact . </s>
And that 's why I came to that decision . </s>
I do n't dispute that there is a possibility that some of the methods endorsed by the Bush administration may have worked at times . But what that boils down to is an “ends justify the means '' argument . And that 's the argument that we reject . </s>
Because there is -- you can not achieve perfect safety . </s>
Might we have found that information without using enhanced interrogation methods ? Might we have used it if we had prioritized our intelligence , gathering our law enforcement in other ways ? They talk about plots that were foiled . They do n't talk about all the blind alleys that they went down . They do n't talk about all of the lives that were ruined through false confessions that were wrung out of people in coercive interrogations . </s>
They do n't talk about the people that were falsely accused and only years later were released with no apology , no compensation . </s>
So it 's not entirely one sided . </s>
Yes , sometimes the methods may work . But if they 're un-American , then we should not be doing them . </s>
If you 're going to debate about what constitutes appropriate interrogation methods , invite me back . I 'd be happy to come . But that 's not what this is about . This is are these or are these not enemy combatants . And if they are enemy combatants , do I have the right to hold them , consistent with the laws of armed conflict because they are a danger to you . </s>
The Geneva Convention does n't require me to prove that they 're a criminal . </s>
I simply have to have reasonable belief that they 're enemy combatants . </s>
But General , the implications of -- the implications of that decision actually in practice have to do with the most important and critical information , the rationale for even heeling to your position is to be able to interrogate them using certain methods . No , no . The rationale , the primary purpose is to take the enemy combatant off the battlefield . And if you overcomplicate my taking them off the battlefield by capturing him , you will leave me with one other choice to take him off the battlefield , and that 's to kill him . </s>
Now , do you want to create that box ? If the American political process wants to create that box , the people who are left behind in the intelligence service will work in that box . </s>
But that is a far less noble box than continuing the war as we have traditionally fought wars . I was stunned -- Could I respond to that , John ? Wait . One comment . </s>
Okay , one comment , and then David . I was stunned that Stephen made the comment to follow American history . When in American history have we had habeas hearings for enemy combatants ? David ? I think we need to be very clear about who we 're talking about and define who we 're referring to when we 're talking about terrorists because from our perspective , we are not talking about people who were actually captured on a battlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan . </s>
There is no doubt that there is in fact an armed conflict going on in those places . </s>
And as a military attorney , as a judge advocate , certainly I acknowledge that under the laws of war , we do have the power to detain and remove from the battlefield people who are engaged in active conflict . The problem is that the war has been defined in such amorphous terms that there 's a claim of a global battlefield , including the United States , and that anyone who essentially is against America , and mostly we 're talking about -- their focus is on Islamic terrorists -- are enemy combatants . So a Major Hassan is a terrorist . But really , he 's a criminal . </s>
People -- if you are in the United States , and you attempt to commit a crime , the United States really is not a battlefield . I reject that . And even if it you think it is , the Constitution does apply here . So there is a limited group of people that , yes , if it 's in an active war in a theater of war that they can be captured and removed from the battlefield . But the solution -- we have captured a lot of people . </s>
We do not screen them well . We sent people who were brought in for ransom without , you know , any back checking , fact checking , and packed them off to Guantanamo . And that 's something that 's unprecedented in American history . Let me get Marc Thiessen into it . I 'd like to -- I 'm not a lawyer . </s>
You have an advantage over us . </s>
But I 'd like to enter some documents into evidence , right ? The inaugural address of Barack Obama . Objection Our nation is at war – Hearsay </s>
That is a true statement . The inaugural address of Barack Obama , our nation is at war against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred . Please pass that to the other side . Congressional authorization of use of military force passed by the House of Representatives 420 to 1 , Senate 98 to nothing . </s>
We are at war . </s>
Supreme Court of the United States in the Hamdi decision . We are at war , we can hold people captured in the war as enemy combatants . And , my final piece of evidence , Osama bin Laden’s fatwa , which is entitled : “Declaration of War Against the Americans.” What part of war do you not understand ? We are at war . </s>
The president , the Congress , the Supreme Court and the enemy all think we 're at war , and you do not . Stephen Jones </s>
Well I suppose the problem that I have , Marc , is that I 'm old enough to remember when Lyndon Johnson said we were at war with Vietnam and the legacy and the things that were done in the name of the declaration of war which was nonexistent . I regret to say that I 'm old enough to remember what one of the presidents of my own party did in the name of national security in Watergate and when he tried to use the CIA and the FBI in the name of national security . </s>
I remember what happened in Iran Contra . </s>
And I remember the efforts made to assassinate Patrice Lumumba , and Premier Castro , Dr. Castro , and how that backlashed in this country , and I 'm sorry . The powers of the federal government in the last 50 years destroyed any credibility when we were asked to believe people in power because frequently they know no more than what we can read in the Economist or the New York Times . Now , that information may be subject to different interpretation . But General Hayden talked about when in history have we had habeas for enemy combatants . </s>
General , your argument is not with me ; it 's with the Supreme Court , the majority of whom my presidents appointed . And they brought the argument three times that these people are entitled to habeas review . And if we look at our history , those things that we thought were good in a time of war because the national interest compelled it were wrong . And there is no greater example of that than the internment of 200,000 Japanese on the West Coast in World War II because we thought our national security required that we round them up , take them out of their homes and put them in detention camp because they had attacked Pearl Harbor . </s>
At least their Imperial Navy did . </s>
All of which , at least I want to say to the other side , all of which at least go to the issue of violation of core US values that we say define us . Your opponents are saying , essentially , and I think they used the word “un-American.” </s>
That your position is so at odds with what we value , including , equal protection under the law . That what you’re doing is un-American . Can you respond to that ? Well I will tell you something about that , Stephen mentioned American history . No no , I want the answer to his question . </s>
No , I’m answering his question . Since the Revolutionary War , the United Stateshas held over 5 million enemy combatants . Until the war on terror , not one of them was given habeas corpus rights to petition their detention . The Geneva Convention , which regulates the conduct of war , nowhere in there does it say that you have a right to contest your detention in a war . My mother is here . </s>
And my mother was a prisoner of war . </s>
She fought in the Warsaw uprising in Poland against the Nazis . She threw Molotov cocktails at German soldiers . </s>
And she was taken into a prisoner of war camp in Germany that would make Guantanamo look like the Four Seasons . </s>
And she was not given the right to petition . You would be referring to the Geneva Conventions that the Bush administration said did not apply . Excuse me . Yes . Well this is the point . </s>
You want to give Geneva Convention rights to terrorists . Well you don’t even want to give them Geneva Convention rights because you don’t accept that it’s a war . </s>
But to take the argument to argument . My mother followed the laws of war . She was in an army that carried its weapons openly , that did not target civilians , that wore uniforms or distinctive insignia . </s>
Terrorists do none of those things ; they violate all of the rules of war , and so you want to get more rights -- if I understand your position you want to get more rights to people who violate the laws of war , than rights to the people like my mother who followed the laws of war never had . It’s not that we don’t trust you , but I want to check all this with your mother . Is she here ? </s>
Can you stand up for just a moment ? Is it all true ? </s>
Is it all true , everything he says ? </s>
Are you proud of Marc ? David Frakt It’s ironic that I 'm being accused of not understanding war . </s>
I have been awarded Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Service Medal , two National Defense Service Medals , I understand that we are at war . My objection is to the conduct of that war in the way that we have particularly domestically , are operating and , yes , and I have freely acknowledged that we can detain combatants on the battlefield . Where there is a question about whether they’re -- what their status is , then they 're entitled to a hearing under the Geneva Conventions . At a minimum , they are entitled -- all persons are entitled to humane treatment . And this is what we got away from in the early years of the Bush administration until the Supreme Court over time reigned in these abuses . </s>
But these are the abuses that they would like to get back to . </s>
And I think , Marc suggested that we want to broaden and expand rights , and you know actually that 's not such a bad thing . Over time history marches forward and human rights are expanded . And sometimes we extend those rights even to people whom we despise . </s>
Actually , I’d like to hear from Michael Hayden . David , we both served in the Air Force and I commend you for your service but it’s unfair to make that -- again , if you want to talk about what was done in terms of interrogation , again , it’s a separate debate . This is a legal concept . Which of the equally valued legal systems do we want to use ? Domestic criminal law , or the laws of armed conflict ? </s>
I think we have the right as a nation to use the laws of armed conflict because we were attacked by an opposing armed enemy force . And Stephen , I have to say , you have a broad suspicion of government , and you went back to Vietnam , and Gulf of Tonkin , and I think the historical record is quite clouded whether or not the Turner Joy was fired on by North Korean patrol craft . I don’t think that there is any dispute that we were attacked in New York City and in Washington . Stephen Jones to respond . I concede that point , but it’s not the historical accuracy of the initiating incident that’s at issue . </s>
It’s what we do about the incident after it’s happened . </s>
I’d like to go to the audience for your questions now . And the way this will work , if you raise your hand , my system tends to be geographical , I start on the left and move to the right . </s>
A microphone will be brought to you . When the mic reaches you , if you could , stand up and hold it about this far away so the radio and television audience can hear you , we appreciate it , if you 're a member of the news media we 'd appreciate it if you 'd just identify yourself and I just need to shade my eyes for a moment , to see . Okay , on the far side in the dark shirt . </s>
Again I urge you to ask a real question and to keep it terse and you’re not here to debate the debaters , you’re here to help them to debate with each other . Thank you . Yes , I think that something has been left somewhat clouded in the discussion , and that is that we 've debated here and heard a lot pro and con of whether they should be treated— captured and the way that they’re treated as criminals versus enemy combatants . What I haven’t heard is a clear definition of what the treatment should be when it is declared that they are enemy combatants . In other words are we looking at recourse under military commissions ? </s>
Are we looking at a suspension of some of those concerns because of national security ? I think for a lot of people , we’re uneasy as to the definition behind enemy combatant and the set of prerogatives that would set in if that were to prevail , and we are leaving an open mind on that . </s>
So perhaps people can clarify that for us ? </s>
Thank you . Marc Thiessen , I’d like to go to Marc because you just wrote a whole book about this . Enemy combatants – when you capture someone who’s a member of Al Qaeda or the Taliban or is carrying , for example who tries to set his underwear on fire on a Detroit airplane and blow up a plane over Detroit that could’ve killed hundreds of people – our position is that that’s an enemy combatant . And that person , when you take him into custody , the first words out of your mouth are not , you have the right to remain silent . Because this is the problem with the difference between our approaches and practice , is that they believe , because they are lawyers and this is the world they live in , that the purpose of interrogation is to obtain evidence for a criminal trial . </s>
The criminal trial is a third order of interest for those who are involved with protecting the country . The first job is to get intelligence to stop another terrorist attack . So when , for example , the Christmas Day bomber is questioned for 50 minutes and then told he has the right to remain silent , you’re not going to get , even if he’s being incredibly cooperative , in 50 minutes you could not exhaust all the information . But the thing is that if you were trying to -- if you take the law enforcement approach to interrogation , patience is a virtue . You are trying to get evidence and you can take as much time as you want , build a relationship with the guy , you try to coerce them in an interview , try to co-opt them into giving you information , fool them into giving information . </s>
If you are trying to stop a terrorist attack , patience is deadly . This guy -- when the Christmas Day bomber was captured , he was supposed to be vaporized on that plane . </s>
As soon as Al Qaeda found out that he was alive and in U.S. custody , they started covering his tracks . They started shutting down e-mail addresses , they started shutting down camps where he was training , they started hiding operatives who he knows about , they started hiding safe houses and closing them down . So he takes three weeks to do -- and he’s even trained in interrogation resistance -- to buy time and use the legal system in order to buy his fellows on the outside time . We need to get that information quickly . </s>
Okay . I’d like to respond to that . I just wanted David Frakt to respond to this . A little bit of an unclarity and that is that even after a lawyer is assigned , I believe that interrogation can proceed . </s>
Isn’t that correct ? But he doesn’t have to answer any questions . Once he has a lawyer , he’s not going to answer any questions . </s>
I will tell you there were many people who did cooperate -- </s>
No , first of all , I will tell you who says this : Eric Holder . Eric Holder , after John Walker Lindh was captured in Afghanistan and brought over here , Eric Holder was being interviewed on CNN in 2002 and they said can they get tough with him in the interrogation and he said well he’s not going to tell you anything now that he has a lawyer and is in America . Speaking from experience , people with lawyers and confess all the time . They confess even though they’ve been given their Miranda rights . </s>
So maybe you think Osama bin Laden , to use the most extreme example , is not familiar with the rule of Miranda ? I mean they use -- most of those of us who practice law daily in the courts of law know that many police detectives are just as skilled as the people you want to use enhanced detection , that the purpose of interrogation is not prosecution , it’s to gather evidence frequently on an intelligence basis whether it’s financial crimes or drug crimes , and that many thousands of defendants who are told they have the right to remain silent , spill their guts . I’d like to get back to the question which was a good one and given that this was a motion that was proposed by our opponents , I thought that they would try to define it . </s>
But actually what we’re doing is constantly shifting back and forth because they say , well , we’re at war , so it’s enemy combatants . We acknowledge in the active battlefield and active theater of conflict in Iraq , in Afghanistan , those who are actively fighting against us are enemy combatants and can be treated under the laws of war . Now where it gets murky is when we’re talking about people here in the United States . </s>
And the prior administration’s policies were to treat Americans , American citizens as enemy combatants , American citizens were locked up in military prisons for years and before that case could ever go to the Supreme Court , they decided to drop it . So we have to differentiate between an active battlefield and what’s going on domestically . Now Mr. Thiessen says that membership , if we pick up someone who’s a member of Taliban or Al Qaeda -- I mean , these people do not carry membership cards . And we also have to distinguish between Al Qaeda and Taliban . </s>
The Taliban is a fighting force in Afghanistan and Pakistan . They just want us to leave . They are not terrorists . They 're not launching international terrorist attacks . Al-Qaeda is . </s>
I would argue that the Taliban was essentially the lawful military government and military force of Afghanistan at the time we attacked and therefore was entitled to Geneva Convention status protection as prisoners of war . But we did not afford them that . Another thing that 's important to talk about is when we say terrorist , what they 're really talking about are suspected terrorists , people that they believe may be terrorists . Now , if someone tries to light their underwear on fire in a plane , yes , you have a pretty good indication that they 're a terrorist . But it 's usually not that clear cut . </s>
It 's usually based on some intelligence from some source or method that we 're not allowed to know about that they suspect someone . And in that case , to simply lock that person up , incommunicado for potentially for years , if I 'm understanding what Marc is proposing , is problematic . And we have gotten a lot of the wrong people . </s>
Now , yes , if we interrogate . Wait , actually -- I have one point about interrogation -- Very quickly , because I have to -- We interrogate people -- yes , people have information . </s>
We may eventually get it . </s>
But why limit it to terrorists ? Why do n't we do that to every single person that 's suspected of any crime ? Why not drug traffickers because -- We 'll come back to that because we 're going to keep going in circles on the same territory , and I want to move it . And I bet we do come back to it . </s>
In uniform , the third row . I believe you 're -- are you part of the West Point contingent ? I am , sir . </s>
My name is Captain Cinnamon Macer , I 'm a judge advocate for the U.S. Army , currently assigned to the United States Military Academy , the department of law . </s>
I do teach Constitutional and military law . We have some work that put us here this evening . </s>
Let me clarify first this comes in my personal capacity . I 'm asking this question not anything to do with the army or West Point . I clearly acknowledge that you are more intelligent that I , that you have the access to information I never will . </s>
My question comes in the fact that I 'm assuming , aside from you , sir , that maybe you 've never been deployed . </s>
No , I have not . I 've been to Iraq . I 've been to Afghanistan . Without fail , every time I interacted with an Iraqi or an Afghan , their single question to me was this : How do you explain Guantanamo Bay ? Let me ask you my question . </s>
My question is not whether we should treat them like enemy combatants or criminals , but whichever we decide , there are always consequences to a decision . And if you take it out and extract what -- the implication this causes for those of us who are fighting these wars , who do know we are a nation at war , so in the next year as I leave for my third deployment , possibly , when I get out there , or as I 'm teaching my cadets , this is the way we do things because we 're America , how do I justify us giving it the moral high ground ? And do you think we are ? </s>
Absolutely . </s>
We ca n't go around and champion ourselves as the land of the free and the just -- Michael Hayden . In the case of vs. Bush , there was a -- I 'm going to let them get to the question . -- something . </s>
May I finish ? No . I -- you 're good . That 's all you get , 30 seconds . But the law says -- </s>
Ma'am , please . Ma'am , ma'am . nations principles of -- Michael Hayden -- </s>
-- of law . </s>
-- please . Yeah . First of all , captain , thank you for your service . I 'm puzzled . I understand the image of Guantanamo . </s>
And we had serious questions inside the Bush administration about Guantanamo . As David suggested , we took about two-thirds of the prison population out of Guantanamo , not as David suggested , because we thought they were innocent . We actually transferred them to third countries actually to kind of home of record with the assumption that they would then be held there or watched there so that they would no longer be a danger , all right ? I guess if you believe we are at war and that these are enemy combatants , we 've got to put them somewhere . I 'm not wedded to Guantanamo . </s>
I understand the image issue . </s>
But our right to detain them , I think , is unarguable under the laws of armed conflict . And -- -- to be held for eight years without trial or with evidence against you . No . Captain , I 'm sorry . </s>
You 're the lawyer , and I 'm not , all right ? </s>
But nowhere does Geneva require us to try enemy combatants . I sat with -- in my last capacity as head of CIA , I had multiple visits from the president of the International Red Cross as we were trying to get closer to some of the things they were suggesting to us . He never suggested we had to try anybody . They did have -- as David knows , they have CSRTs , combatant status review tribunals , which is what happens within the military . It is the tradition of the military to ensure through this process , due process , that the individual you have is indeed the individual you believe them to be . </s>
I just do n't understand what of this enemy is unlawful . </s>
And the unlawful combatant or unprivileged belligerent is the new phraseology . What does that give them rights that 6 million other prisoners of war we 've held as a nation have not had ? Marc Thiessen , do you want to join your partner on this one , because I think -- </s>
I do want to , because I -- I thank you also for your service , but I think my answer to you is what you say is you should defend the other people in uniform who serve proudly at Guantanamo and keep this country safe . The fact is that most of those people are asking those questions because of misstatements , mistruths and lies that have been spread about Guantanamo Bay . You mean the Iraqis are misinformed . Iraqis , people around the world because people in -- these allegations go out there and , as my old boss , Donald Rumsfeld used to say , the truth goes around the world 30 times before -- lies go around the world 30 times before troops get their boots off . Every investigation into conduct at Guantanamo Bay has found these allegations of widespread abuse are false . </s>
Brigadier generals Schmidt and Furlow did a careful investigation . </s>
No , quote , no evidence of torture or inhumane treatment at JCF Guantanamo . They 've made the inspector general A.T. Church , who I interviewed for my book , and who said he expected to find widespread abuse at Guantanamo said that when he investigated , conducted hundreds of interviews , interviewed detainees , interviewed everybody who had been there . He said we can confidently state , based upon this investigation , we found nothing that would any way substantiate detainees’ allegations of torture or violent physical abuse at Guantanamo . Now , I 'll tell you something . We are also hearing from the other side that people there are the poor sheep herders and goat herders who have been wrapped up and taken to Guantanamo . </s>
The combat leadership of the Taliban today is made up of Guantanamo alumni . </s>
Just last week in Yemen , the Yeminis arrested a Guantanamo alumnus who was joining al-Qaeda in the Arabian peninsula . And the man who is one of the leaders of al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula who sent the Christmas day bomber is a former Guantanamo inmate . These are dangerous , dangerous people . Okay . And even the Obama administration 's review found 95 percent of the people who are there right now are either leaders or fighters for al-Qaeda and the Taliban . </s>
Marc , thank you . David Frakt , do you want to respond ? </s>
But I sort of feel the captain did your work for you on that question . Well , I want to respond to a specific point made by Marc about this reports , investigations into detainee abuse at Guantanamo and the claim that they searched , and they did n't find anything . He referenced the Church report , the Schmidt-Furlow report . When I was representing Mohammed Jawad , a teenage boy from Afghanistan at Guantanamo , a prosecutor by the name of lieutenant colonel Darrel Vandeveld turned over some discovery materials to me that showed that my then , at that point , 16 or 17- year-old client had been subjected to what was called the frequent flyer sleep deprivation program . And according to the Schmidt-Furlow report , they had discovered that there had been a frequent flyer sleep deprivation program . </s>
And during this program , detainees were moved , and in the case of my client , 112 times from cell to cell during a two-week period . He was moved constantly back and forth in an effort to deprive him of sleep . And so -- but according to the Schmidt-Furlow report , this program had been stopped after a complaint by the FBI , it had been stopped in March of 2004 . The only problem with that was that my client had been subjected to the program in May of 2004 . </s>
And so I asked Colonel Vandeveld to continue digging , and he found additional records that showed that this program continued for at least another year . And dozens of other people were subjected to it . In fact , we had the person who ran the program . There was a major , who was an intelligence officer in the army , came to testify at Guantanamo in the hearing that -- in which I was representing a detainee and said this was standard operating procedure . The generals knew about it . </s>
Everybody was vetted and approved . So these investigations were white washes . </s>
They missed widespread abuses . I tried to bring this to the attention of the Department of Defense . </s>
I filed a report of a violation of the Law of Armed Conflict , as is my duty to do as a military officer . What did they do ? Nothing , no follow-up investigation , I was never contacted . So we have a very basic disagreement about what we think is happening inside the walls of Guantanamo . </s>
You say that basically there have been very few undocumented violations and David is saying that these are whitewashed , that there 's reports that say that . </s>
I think that 's a shocking thing to say about Admiral Church and those people who are -- you know , people who wore our uniform with honor -- hold on , no , you talked , now let me -- Marc , respond , please . Okay , let me get a word in here , please . </s>
Now wait , you 've had no problem on getting the words in . This frequent flier program you referred to , where for someone who 's moved once every four hours roughly , two to four hours , what do you think these detainees in Guantanamo do all day ? They 're not busting rocks . They 're not making a license plates . </s>
They sleep . They read the Koran . They play foosball . They play soccer . </s>
They eat whenever they want , sleep whenever they want . This is not torture . There is frequent flier . </s>
You may not like it . But I 'll tell you something , people -- interrogation , interrogation techniques , even interrogation techniques under the Geneva Convention people would find shocking if you 're not familiar with interrogation -- interrogation is not supposed to be pleasant . </s>
And you have in the case of some of these people who are at Guantanamo , people who are senior al-Qaeda leaders , senior Taliban leaders who have intelligence about the possibility of planned attacks against the United States and they have the responsibility to get them within the rules of law , and they did it . And these -- investigations were conducted , they were open , and they found no evidence of widespread abuse . And that 's because the senior al-Qaeda leaders were locked up in secret CIA ghost prisons in Eastern European countries and in Thailand and places that we were not allowed to know about , that 's where the worst abuses went on , but there were plenty of horrific abuses at Guantanamo -- Michael Hayden -- I 'll come back . </s>
-- was the Director of the CIA . </s>
I 'll come back with a debate on interrogation techniques , just sign me up . To summarize the last statement , I believe the American armed forces are competent and capable of holding enemy combatants as prisoners of war consistent with the laws of armed conflict . Discussion about that point or distraction from the basic question we have in front of us today . </s>
Another question from the audience ? </s>
And I just want to encourage you , again , the Captain 's question was terrific , but please to keep the rhetorical flourishes to a minimum because they chew up time and the question was so good all by itself . In the front row , and then I 'll start moving up after that . Could you -- so could you please rise just so the camera can find you ? Kayvon Afshari , CBS News . </s>
I do want to come back to David Frakt 's fundamental point , and I 'd like to get a response from Marc in particular . A lot of the guilt or innocence of these suspected enemy combatants is a lot more nebulous than that of Abdulmutallab , so I just want to know on a very practical level if we do n't go through the criminal justice system , how do we know if they are terrorists ? First of all , it 's not about guilt . You do n't have to prove guilt . </s>
These are not criminal defendants . You have to have a reasonable belief that these people were captured in the war and that they are members of al-Qaeda or the Taliban and were conducting operations against us . The fact is , we have detained in the War on Terror well over 100,000 people . Only 800 made it to Guantanamo . Only 100 made it into the CIA program . </s>
So these are -- we 're not just picking people up off the street and throwing them in Guantanamo . </s>
Were there some people that were sent there by accident , that we made a mistake ? Our enemy does n't wear uniforms . They don’t follow a chain of command is hard . There 's some mistakes made , absolutely , and we had a process in Guantanamo that was set up to review the evidence against them and to make sure that people who were not -- did n't belong there were sent back . But the reality is that we got - - you know , if we -- the left always wants to get this debate onto the topic of abuse . </s>
This is a debate about keeping this country safe with the exception of one of our debaters . Michael Hayden . </s>
What 's the judicial process you would use for killing the believed enemy combatant as opposed to capturing him ? Stephen Jones . Well , I think , Marc , the problem that I have , and I think David is right , capturing people on the battlefield is different than arresting someone at the Detroit Airport for committing or attempting to commit what is clearly a violation of the federal criminal law , and can not take that person consistent with the Constitution of the United States and Title 18 , which is the Criminal Code , and try him other than in a federal criminal court according to the federal rules of criminal procedure and the federal rules of evidence and to maintain that you can -- You’re wrong . </s>
Well , you’re wrong . No . We don’t have a separate criminal justice system for people that commit crimes in the United States . And it isn’t a question mark of politics or the Left or the Right -- </s>
Stephen , could you just stay with your mic please ? </s>
-- or Bush versus Obama . It’s a question of the Constitution . </s>
It’s not political , it’s Constitutional and there’s one system of law in this country . </s>
Now I will concede that in a battlefield situation abroad or outside the United States , the line is blurry . </s>
But when you start saying that you’re going to arrest people and try them in a military tribunal for crimes committed in the United States against American citizens , I don’t think the American people will tolerate that . Stephen -- This is an Intelligence Squared debate . </s>
I’m John Donvan of ABC and I’m serving as moderator as we debate this motion : “treat terrorists like enemy combatants not criminals.” We have two teams against two who are hashing it out . </s>
We are now going to Marc Thiessen to respond to the point just made . First of all , ex parte quirin 1942 , this is the Supreme Court : one who takes up arms against the United States in a foreign theater of war regardless of his position shall be regarded properly as an enemy combatant and treated as such . It doesn’t matter whether they’re a citizen or not . I would now assume that you now consider Franklin Roosevelt was a war criminal because of the military commissions for the saboteurs who were captured here are unconstitutional as well . And on top of that , military commissions that have been held outside of the Article Three court going back to George Washington . </s>
I assume he’s not a war criminal either . But again , you’re completely focused on the criminal justice system . </s>
I don’t care if we put Khalid Sheikh Mohammed on trial or not when we capture him . When Khalid Sheikh Mohammed is captured , I want to know what his plans for the next attack are . My question to you is you’re focused on where he’s going to be tried . I want to find out what he knows . When Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured , if you were the one who was responsible for getting the information , in the case he’s captured , he’s killed 3000 people just down the street from here . </s>
He admits to you that he has plans for new attacks in motion . Does Khalid Sheikh Mohammed have the right to remain silent ? Well of course he has the right to remain silent . The only difference between your position and mine is that you don’t think that he should be told he has the right to remain silent and I think it’s beside the point because of course he knows he has the right to remain silent . </s>
So you’re saying -- let’s say we captured Khalid Sheikh Mohammed before the 9/11 attacks . Put aside the litany of attacks that he had in play . You would have allowed 9/11 to go on rather that to get him to give the information that he had . </s>
Now Marc , let’s don’t defend the indefensible here . </s>
It’s not the indefensible . Khalid Sheikh Mohammed killed 3000 people in this country . He had information , a plot to blow up the Library Tower in Los Angeles , blow up a marine camp in Djibouti , to blow up the consulate in Karachi . These are real attacks . </s>
To commit , repeat 9/11 in London . Well that may be true but I don’t want to take “The Weekly Standard’s” word for it or frankly your book . If all of that is true , then it can be presented to an American jury . </s>
An American jury will convict him and give him the death penalty . What if the clock is ticking in the situation that Marc’s just described . You believe he knows about something that’s about to happen we’re five minutes away . Would it make a difference ? There’s a movie about that and I think that’s an over-dramatization of the issue . </s>
Those who look for a way to short-cut the system always first bring forward the most extreme example of what could happen . But the truth of the matter is those extreme examples rarely exist . </s>
Where they do exist , I believe the intelligence community and the law enforcement community have on numerous occasions shown the ability much better than politicians to protect individual security or , for that matter , national security . David Frakt , you wanted -- Yes . I mean the whole ticking time bomb scenario is really a red herring . </s>
First of all , police , in the situation where there is an urgent public safety emergency are not required to give the Miranda warning . So -- but if your question is should we use torture in that situation ? And that’s essentially what Marc is saying is that , you know , in order to prevent an attack , you have to be willing to do anything , whatever it takes . And that 's where we have a fundamental disagreement . </s>
If we captured Osama Bin Laden , I would not torture him . </s>
Is that possibly going to lead to an attack that might have been prevented ? It might . Are you okay with that ? </s>
I am okay with it because it would be a great tragedy . </s>
But it would be a greater tragedy to go down the road which we already went down of torturing , because that one attack may not be averted , but you are going to multiply the attacks for years to come because of the torture . And that is what we have done . Again , I -- -- I 'll come back and walk , if you like a debate on a different subject but as the only one on stage who has actually had the question in front of him as to whether or not it -- Except , Michael , that your partner brought these issues to the table himself in his opening remarks in talk -- in justifying and laying out several scenarios in which the actual methods did do it . </s>
I think they 're relevant . I do n't think it 's -- it 's not a vote on that , but I think it 's germane to understanding what the motion means . And I 'd like to see if Marc could respond to what was just said because this is where the rubber hit the road . </s>
Well , actually , no . Let me finish , because the rubber hit the road on my car , all right ? I 'm the one who has to make the decision , okay ? These are not easy decisions . There are conflicting values . </s>
There are moral responsibilities galore , okay ? </s>
No one should trivialize it , and no one should throw bumper stickers at the difficulty of the decision people like me , people like Leon Panetta , have to make , all right ? </s>
But I come back -- But I come back to the fundamental question , the American armed forces , the American intelligence community are capable of holding people , consistent with the laws of armed conflict . I feel as if we have gone through the looking glass in the last 30 to 40 minutes as we try to take people who are armed enemy combatants -- and David did not make the straw man that Iraq is okay to capture , it 's not okay to capture and keep enemy combatants in Brooklyn , okay ? What about Mali ? </s>
What about Djibouti , what about Yemen ? What about the horn of Africa ? What about Pakistan ? That is where the enemy is . That is where the enemy is mounting an attack against our citizens . </s>
They are enemy combatants . And as God is my judge , I will use the full authority that the law of armed conflict gives me as long as my president and my Congress has given me that authorization . And your partner , Marc Thiessen . </s>
I would add to that to complete . We 're not going to have time to debate all of the interrogation techniques . </s>
They were not torture . </s>
And I can walk you through it if you really want to . I 'd rather not . </s>
Well -- Well , I 'll tell you something . You said something , and this is – you’re sort of dismissive of the threat in a very sort of disturbing way . You said well , yeah , I 've let the -- you basically admitted you had let the attack happened and treat him as a criminal rather than an enemy combatant . You know , you said earlier , when -- about my introductory remark , two little terrorist networks . </s>
Well , you know what ? One of those two little terrorist networks killed 3,000 people down the street from here , 19 men with box cutters . This is a real threat . These people are out there every day trying to kill us . </s>
And I think it 's really shameful to dismiss them as two little terrorist networks . Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in Pakistan . You said unless he 's in Iraq or Afghanistan , he 's not an enemy combatant . So do you consider can a lead sheik Mohammed an enemy combatant , the master mind of 9/11 , the man who commanded the operation , the operational commander of al-Qaeda ? Is he an enemy combatant , yes or no ? </s>
How do you know that he is the mastermind of 9/11 ? What -- </s>
Oh , my God . </s>
He has not been put on trial . And you do n't want to put him on trial . And you are denying those 3,000 victims -- </s>
I 'm not denying them anything . You are denying -- you say it 's not important to have a trial . I say it is important to have a trial . It 's not the first priority . </s>
It is important to establish the truth of what happened and for people to get some closure . And it 's important for these people to be punished . I do not in any way diminish the seriousness of 9/11 . And I agree with General Hayden that these are difficult decisions . And I am not sure that I would want to be in the position he was in of having to make those . </s>
But what I will tell you is that the oath that we take , that we both took as officers in the United States military is to defend the Constitution of the United States . It is not to defend the people of the United States . Because what we are defending are our values and our history . And sometimes , yes , it may cost lives . </s>
But you can not achieve perfect security . And when you try to , by making shortcuts , you ultimately diminish us as a country . And it does not serve us in the long run . </s>
Yes from the -- the blue jacket and white -- blue shirt and dark blue Blazer . Yep . Your colleague is tapping you on the shoulder . Could you just wait for the microphone ? And again , to keep it as a question and -- </s>
My name is Les Shelton , and my question is that -- comes from the fact that it seems that what was really most difficult is what is the definition , operationally of a person whose terrorist that talking how can we be sure that a terrorist on a bus in Pakistan and the whole bus is grabbed because they know a terrorist is on the bus . And how do we understand , as people listening to all this , how we can feel comfortable with the shortcut because nobody wants their ass burned . </s>
And the fact of the matter is we need to feel a bit more -- I need to feel a bit more comfortable about the selection process for applying these definitions is somehow rational . And I have to say that our legal system is one of the ways those things are done . But again , we have a group of people who say they 're experts . And they know these people are . But we have a bad history . </s>
That is n't always the case . Sir , can you cut to your question . The question is how do we make this distinction so that all of us can feel more comfortable with what our government may be doing ? You mean the distinction who are the terrorists and who is not ? </s>
Yeah . You know , how to get the innocents off the bus . How and who ? I mean , there is also the question of who makes the distinction as well . </s>
Yeah . </s>
Let 's take that to the side for the motion . Mike , go ahead . It 's a process . </s>
It 's a rigorous process . I governed it while I was the director of CIA with regard to that portion of the war that CIA had responsibility for . To be clear , just being a terrorist does n't get much interest from us . The authorization we have from the Congress and the authorization for the use of military force is against al-Qaeda and its affiliates . </s>
So it 's not a global terrorist issue . We are at war with a select group of terrorists . </s>
President Obama has made that clear . The Congress has made that clear . President Bush has made that clear . We used same criteria to capture an individual as a terrorist that we use on the battlefield to kill . It is visual who is a terrorist . </s>
I am responding to the political processes of the American state . All three branches of government have said we are at war . I 'm using the full authority given to me . I use it in the clearest conscience I have . Are mistakes made on the battlefield ? </s>
Killing , capturing ? Of course , they are . </s>
What -- you have very good men and women working very hard to apply absolute precision to their task . Now , I will admit that the processes of intelligence are a bit different than the processes of the judicial system . </s>
Again , as I mentioned in the one habeas case , we had to fold our tent and admit defeat because I could not , in conscience , tell the enemy combatant who the source of our information was . </s>
If I did that , I would quickly not have sources of information anywhere in the world . </s>
And so we had to make a serious tradeoff . That 's what I mean by putting this into a law enforcement template , rather than using a vigorous and consistent with the rule of law , law of armed conflict . Thank you , Michael Hayden . Go ahead and take one more question . </s>
There is -- on the far aisle , almost near the top . Yes . Up seven steps . Thank you . I think my question is for General Hayden . </s>
You and your partner have admitted that mistakes are sometimes made as to who does get picked up as a terrorist . In the civilian justice system , we say it 's something of a cliché , that it 's better for 100 guilty men to walk free than to convict an innocent man unjustly . </s>
What 's your calculation in the war on terror ? </s>
How many non-terrorists can be rendered off the streets of Toronto or Amsterdam to make it okay ? Obviously there 's no precise answer to the question . Michael Hayden . We do the very best we can . </s>
And we review our data constantly . As I mentioned , to David 's point -- and he’s nodding in agreement because he 's familiar with the process . We have combatant status review teams even before we had the habeas process at Guantanamo . You go over the evidence routinely . It 's required by our regulations . </s>
It 's required by the regime that 's in place at Guantanamo . </s>
I hope the audience is not demanding 100 percent certitude and 100 percent perfection before your intelligence services or your military services can act in your defense . And that concludes round two of our debate . We are about to hear closing statements from each debater . There will be two minutes , each . This is their last chance to change your mind . </s>
You will be asked to vote once again immediately after they speak and to pick the winner in this debate just a few minutes from now . </s>
Our motion is `` Treat Enemy Terrorists Like -- '' excuse me -- our motion is `` Treat Terrorists Like Enemy Combatants , Not Criminals . '' And first , to summarize his position against the motion , Stephen Jones , who served as principal defense counsel for Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh . As we have listened to the debate tonight , I think two or three issues have emerged sharply . The issue is not just about the treatment of individuals at Guantanamo Bay . </s>
The issue is larger and that is , what is the system we will use to adjudicate the guilt of those persons charged with crimes against the United States . And I say that the line is indivisible . By that I mean you can not say , `` We have one set of justice over here for these categories of crimes , that one rule of evidence , one rule of procedure , one rule of appellate practice , and over here we have an entirely different rule of evidence and a different procedure.” First , that leaves the intelligence community who are largely anonymous and many law enforcement officers and prosecutors unaccountable in the final analysis for the decision made . </s>
General Hayden has been very correct in telling you that there is not 100 percent perfection and there is n't . </s>
After all , the 9/11 Commission in its report talked about the system was blinking red , so our intelligence and many of our law enforcement officials and indeed political leaders knew of the risks and did nothing . In the final analysis , accountability for responsible decisions has to be made somewhere , political process , the legal process , something done openly , but that is not what the argument is made by our colleagues to our right . </s>
Their argument is trust us , trust us , we 'll get it right this time . Unfortunately history shows too many examples of not getting it right . </s>
That 's why we have the rule of law . </s>
Thank you , Stephen Jones . For the motion to Treat Terrorists Like Enemy Combatants , Not Criminals , and summarizing his position for this motion , Marc Thiessen , a columnist for the Washington Post , a Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , and former speechwriter for President George W. Bush . We did get it right . In the period in the eight years before September 11th , 2001 , al- Qaeda killed roughly 3,500 people in a series of attacks starting with the 1993 World Trade Center bombing , followed by the attack on our embassies in Kenya and Tanzania , followed by the -- or the attack on the USS Cole and culminating in September 11th , 2001 . That was when we followed the law enforcement approach to interrogation . </s>
During that period of time , we prosecuted 29 people in connection with those attacks . If you think that is an approach -- and we did n't get the intelligence we needed to stop the September 11th terrorist attacks , in the period that followed we have not been hit again . So it 's a very stark question ; do you want to go back to the approach when al-Qaeda was mounting attacks of increasingly lethality , or do you want to follow the approach that we took which has kept this country safe for almost a decade ? Our opponents are trying to wiggle out of it . They want you to -- focus you on waterboarding and the interrogation techniques . </s>
If they do n't like the techniques we used , there 's a wide line between waterboarding on one hand and `` You have the right to remain silent , '' lawful techniques that can be used short of that . Choose other techniques , but what their position holds , if you hold that a terrorist is a criminal and not an enemy combatant , we can not kill them using predator drones outside of the war zones of Iraq and Afghanistan . We can not kill them in Pakistan . We can not kill them in Yemen . We can not kill them in East Africa . </s>
There are terrorists plotting to attack us right now that Barack Obama would not be allowed to kill . </s>
And second , we will not be able to interrogate them effectively as we found out after the Christmas Day bomber , as we found out with the Times Square bomber . </s>
So this is a very stark question . Do you want to go back to the approach that led to 3,500 American people getting killed and we were not able to get the intelligence to stop the attack . Or do you want to follow the approach that kept our country safe for almost a decade . Thank you , Marc Thiessen . </s>
The motion is “treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals , ” and summarizing his position against this motion , David Frakt , a lieutenant colonel in the Air Force Reserve , JAG Corps who served as lead defense counsel with the Office of Military Commissions . </s>
Our opponents seem to have valued American lives more than the lives of anybody else . They seem to forget about Madrid , about London , about Bali . </s>
The terrorists have not stopped . But simply because we’ve tightened security domestically and presented easy targets overseas , the action is moved overseas . </s>
We are not safer today than we were on September 12th , 2001 . We are in a worse position because of our actions in the war on terror , our lawlessness and our abandonment of the rule of law . General Hayden talks a lot about the rule of law and serving it but that was not really our experience under the prior administration . </s>
Let me tell you about my personal experience . I was assigned to represent two detainees in Guantanamo . Both had been determined to be enemy combatants in the combatant status tribunals that you heard about . </s>
But in fact , neither was an enemy combatant . One , Mr. Ali Hamza al Bahlul was , in fact , a terrorist . </s>
He was an Al Qaeda insider . He was a media advisor and created propaganda for Al Qaeda . He should have been tried in federal court for material support in terrorism . </s>
He was not an operational terrorist . He did not kill any Americans . He did not plot any attacks on Americans . </s>
The other was neither an enemy combatant nor a terrorist and , in fact , he was a child who had been tortured into confessing to something he didn’t do . A lot of mistakes were made . The rule of law was not observed . Over time , with the intervention of the Supreme Court , we gradually brought the pendulum back to something approaching equilibrium . </s>
But they’re advocating going back . I’m advocating going forward . So we urge you to vote against the proposition . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , David Frakt . Our motion is “treat terrorists as enemy combatants , not criminals , ” and to summarize for the motion , our final speaker , Michael Hayden , former CIA Director and the country’s first principal deputy director of National Intelligence and the former director of the NSA . As I predicted and somewhat feared , we’ve sidled into a discussion as to whether or not you are for or against the rule of law . </s>
I warned you that that was not the issue here , that there is plenty of law with the laws of conflict to govern our behavior and the American armed forces , the American intelligence community are quite capable and competent to function within that framework . I was taken aback a little bit by saying that the intelligence community is not accountable . Clearly Stephen has never been in front of the Senate Select Committee or the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and to go through the openness that we share within the confines of those committees . I was struck as Stephen said the system was blinking red and I think he was alleging some sort of incompetence . </s>
The attack still happened in the summer in September of 2001 . The attack still happened not because the intelligence was wanting -- although certainly you can always use better intelligence . The act took place because the model we were using , the model in which we placed the intelligence which was a law enforcement model . The difference between now and 9/11 is that we are a nation at war and we are taking the fight to the enemy . There’s an office in CIA , most operational office that we have on our Langley campus , responsible for many of the things the current administration is taking credit for . </s>
You walk into that office you hit a bulkhead , a wall , and there’s a sign there saying today’s date and you walk by it , very often don’t recognize it but every now and again you catch it . It actually says today’s date is September 12th , 2001 . It’s been up there for over eight years . When I was director and got in a car and drove down G.W . parkway to my home , it did n't feel like September 12th . It felt a lot like September 10th . </s>
That 's an attitude that we adopt at our peril . Thank you . Thank you , Michael . </s>
That concludes our closing statements . And now it 's time to learn which side argued best . I 'm going to ask you , once again , to vote . Go to those key pads at your seat that will register your vote . And we will get the readout and the results almost instantaneously . </s>
Our motion is “treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals.” If you agree with the motion , push number one . </s>
If you disagree , push number two . </s>
If you are undecided or became undecided , push number three . And you can ignore the other numbers . And if you want to correct your entry , go ahead and do so , and it 'll lock in the latest one . </s>
Yeah . It will be a while , no ? Or did you did you get persuaded to go to the other side ? </s>
I think not . I was undecided before , but I 'm definitely against now . I 'm going to have the results in just a moment . </s>
I think we 've locked out the system . </s>
And I just want to -- first of all , when I said -- when I was going to say the rubber hit the road , it 's rare that we actually -- and I know that it 's in your car . But that we actually came to a kind of moment I think of really essential truth about the difference between the two sides . And it was -- I applaud both sides for going to that point and for a very , very spirited debate from both teams today . And the questions from the audience , including with the rhetorical flourish from West Point , we 're quite good , quite on point and better than we normally get . So I want to thank you for those as well . </s>
This is only the first of our five-part debate series throughout the fall . Our next debate is going to be on Wednesday , October 6th . </s>
Our motion is Islam is a religion of peace . Panelists for this motion are Zeba Khan , a writer and an advocate for Muslim American civic engagement and Maajid Nawaz , a former member of a radical Islamist party who served four years in an Egyptian prison as a prisoner of conscience . Against the motion is Somali born Dutch parliamentarian who has a Fatwa on her head , Ayaan Hirsi Ali and Douglas Murray who is director of the Center for Social Cohesion , which is a London think tank that is focused on radicalism . Individual tickets are still available by visiting our website and at the Skirball box office . We also have outside DVDs of past debates and books by our panelists which obviously include Marc Thiessen 's book . </s>

We had you vote twice , one before the debate and once again at the conclusion . We asked you where you stood on our motion , which is “treat terrorists like enemy combatants , not criminals.” The team that has changed the most minds , that has moved the most percentage points will be declared our winner . Here is how it went . Before the debate , 33 percent of you were for the motion . </s>
32 percent were against . 35 percent were undecided . After the debate , 39 percent for , 55 percent against , 6 percent undecided . The side against the motion wins . Our congratulations to them . </s>
Thank you from me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S . </s>
And now I 'd like to invite all of our debaters to the stage . </s>
I 'm told there 's one exception to the no phone rule , and that is if you are Tweeting . You can Tweet to your heart 's content . </s>
And so that 's it . I also want to -- this is the last of our regular season in our fifth season of Intelligence Squared U.S . And all of them are because of the generosity of our chairman , the Rosenkranz Foundation , who makes this all possible . I 'd like to welcome to the stage Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Well , thank you very much . It 's great to see you all . And my task in these proceedings is to frame the debate , to give a sense of the arguments on both sides . And for more than a century , the statue of liberty has welcomed visitors with an Emma Lazarus poem engraved on its pedestal . Tonight 's motion comes from one of the most famous lines in that poem , `` Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free . '' </s>
Well , today , many would want to rewrite those lines to read “Give me your energetic , your affluent , your educated elites.” But how should we feel about poorly educated , unskilled immigrants , especially those here illegally ? If we analyze the question in terms of costs and benefits , we can see that those who benefit from immigrant labor are a very different group than those who shoulder the costs . </s>
And that may be why the issue is so controversial . Employers of low-wage immigrant labor reach the major benefits , large scale farming operations benefit . And as concerned as we all gain from lower food prices , owners and patrons of restaurants benefit . Affluent household benefit from child care , landscape maintenance , housecleaning and all manner of other services that only immigrants seem eager to provide . </s>
The costs are borne very differently . Low-wage immigrants receive more from government , especially state and local governments than they pay in taxes . The state provides education for their children . </s>
It provides emergency medical care and array of other benefits . In some communities , crime and drug issues disrupt the lives of law-abiding citizens and impose major costs for police , courts and prisons . All these costs add up to a major fiscal drag . And it 's no wonder that states like Arizona favor stricter enforcement of existing laws . And if we think about the question more philosophically , both sides of the debate can cite appealing principles . </s>
“Give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses” does express American generosity of spirit , the vision of our nation as a beacon of opportunity and invokes a rich history of immigrant groups that have succeeded here . But equally appealing principles point in the opposite direction , respect for the rule of law and a basic sense of fairness are also bedrock American values . </s>
Policies that reward those here illegally at the expense of those patiently waiting for legal status fly in the face of those principles . </s>
Considering the costs and the benefits , considering the conflicting principles , which side of the argument should prevail ? Well , it 's up to you to decide . And it 's now my privilege to turn the evening to our panelists and to our moderator , John Donvan . Thank you , John . </s>
Thank you . And I 'd just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible . The famous verse inscribed on a plaque at the base of the Statue of Liberty says `` Give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to be free . '' But do we really all agree on what that means ? </s>
Or if we flip it around and say , `` Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses , '' what does that mean ? Well , that 's what we are here to debate . This is another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We 're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . And here on the stage we have two teams of two members each to argue over this motion , `` Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . '' </s>
We have a Texas mayor . We have a man who has written laws on immigration . We have a former congressman and a journalist who has written about immigration who will be arguing this out and trying to change your minds because that 's what this is . This is a debate in which you , our live audience , are the judges . </s>
By the time the debate has ended , you will have been asked to vote twice , once before the debate and once again afterwards . </s>
And the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winners . So let 's go to your preliminary vote , where you stand on this issue before you actually hear the arguments . There are key pads at your seat on the right hand side . And if you agree with our motion , “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses , ” press number one . </s>
And , yes , you 're voting for a negative so , it 's a little bit tricky . Be careful with that . If you agree -- if you disagree with this motion , press number two . </s>
And if you are undecided , push number three . And if you think you made a mistake , just fix it , and the system will lock in your last vote . And we 're going to share the results of that vote at the end -- the vote that you just made at the end of the debate as we present both the before and the after votes to tell us who you chose as our winner . So on to round one . </s>
Round one , we have opening statements by each debater in turn . They are seven minutes each . </s>
And with our motion , “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses , ” speaking first for this motion , Tom Tancredo . He 's a former Colorado congressman who sought the 2008 Republican nomination for president to bring attention to the issue of illegal immigration . </s>
And while the language of this debate is a little bit spicy and to a degree metaphorical because we know that you 're not against all -- not against all immigration . It 's not that absolute . You did , nevertheless , sign up to argue for this side . That 's right . </s>
Do n't give us… And , Tom , so in a sentence , why have you identified yourself so powerfully with this battle on illegal immigration ? </s>
Well , I will be happy to answer that . Let me first tell you that I must say in response to your discussion about the title of this debate , about the proposition itself , I was a little bit uptight about it originally because , after all , we are debating this issue here in New York City a few miles from Ellis Island . And I have been -- I have participated in things in the past that have been a little bit skewed , and I can recall a spoof of me , a debate -- or actually it was supposed to be a little discussion between me and Vincente Fox , but it was a spoof on `` Saturday Night Live , '' and so they had someone who looked like -- and I knew it was biased from the beginning , from the very beginning because the guy playing me looked like me and the guy playing Vincente Fox was Antonio Banderas -- No fair , come on , guys . </s>
So to my question , in a sentence , why do you identify so powerfully with this ? Frankly , I -- you look at it and begin to think about the ramifications of immigration , both legal and illegal , and they are fascinating . It is really one of the most intellectually stimulating areas of public policy I think we can possibly talk about . </s>
Okay , we 'll let you go , ladies and gentlemen , Tom Tancredo . A great deal of mythology has built up around the Statue of Liberty , around the Emma Lazarus poem , and a lot of that mythology , of course , is just that . It 's mythology . But unfortunately we have a tendency in the United States , we look back sort of nostalgically at a period of time because most of us are either children of or grandchildren of immigrants , and so the whole idea of immigration has a sort of a nostalgic appeal to us , and that 's our first thought usually . And I am the same way . </s>
I am the grandson of Italian immigrants , came right here into Ellis Island . </s>
And my parents being first generation Americans were very , very strict about one thing and that was to become an American , to become -- and it meant a lot of things to them in different ways , and I 'll get to it in a minute , except that I do want you to understand I have that same nostalgic opinion to a large extent of what our immigration policy was , but we ca n't confuse that and make -- and develop true policy today based on mythology and , you know , some of the myths that we have to dispel . </s>
I think tonight 's a good place to do it , it’s -- first of all the Statue of Liberty was not a gift from France that was designed to explore the wonderful idea of open immigration . Indeed it had nothing to do with immigration policy . </s>
It had everything to do with extolling the virtues of a republic . </s>
In fact , the statue was called “Liberty Enlightening the World.” It was not called “Liberty Inviting the World.” As for the Emma Lazarus poem , it was added 30 years after the statue got here . And it was about that time that the author of the poem , Ms. Lazarus , was talking about the need to limit immigration to various groups . Remember also that a lot of the tired , and poor , and huddled masses got stamped “return to sender '' here at Ellis Island . </s>
There were people with dangerous elements and ailments like pinkeye or a cough or fever , and if anyone exhibited any degree of exhaustion by climbing the very steep stairway over at Ellis Island which was purposely built that way , that was one of the things that could get you sent home . It was not a take all comers time in American history . </s>
As for the poor , well , long before the Ellis Island experience , the colonies had enacted very , very stringent regulations about this particular aspect of immigration policy . In New York in 1691 , it required an immigrant to have , quote , `` A visible estate or manual occupation or give a sufficient surety that he shall not be a burden or a charge to the respective place that he shall come to inhabit . '' In 1996 in the Congress of the United States , they tried to actually expand on this and say that you had to have an affidavit signed by someone if you’re coming here , you had to have an affidavit of support . They put it in , it was part of the Welfare Reform Bill , never , not one time , never has it been enforced . And so the fact is we are in a -- unfortunately , we are importing a large degree of poverty into the United States . </s>
The National Academy of Sciences along with the Center for Immigration studies shows that welfare use , the rates for welfare use , are significantly higher for immigrant households than they are for nonimmigrant households . Federation for Immigration Reform could identify a net cost , net cost after taxes were paid by illegal immigrants , they were just focusing on that one part , a net cost to American taxpayers of over $ 150 billion annually . Now , my point here is to show that for a long period of time in American history , we had what I would think was , and believe , is a rational policy . It was rational for us to bring in a lot of people , especially during the hay-day of American immigration , the 1890s and 1900s , a lot of people who were low-skill , low-wage people . Why ? Because , of course , we were building the Industrial Revolution here . </s>
They were fueling it . That was appropriate . It was right . </s>
It served purpose for the people coming and it served a purpose for the people here . </s>
I hope -- well , also , as I see we’re getting toward the end of that 7-minute period , there is another myth I want to try to dispel quickly . And that is that immigration has always been sort of a straight-line increase from the time America started until today , that it’s always just been going up . Absolutely untrue . About 1830 is when immigration began to be statistically relevant in the United States . </s>
It started to climb . By 1850 , it started to go down . </s>
Around 1880 , it grew . Around 1890 , it declined . </s>
It rose dramatically right before the First World War , but declined dramatically after the First World War with the Immigration Act of 1924 . It stayed relatively low for a long period of time until , as a matter of fact , 1965 , when everything changed with the Immigration Act that was pushed by Senator Kennedy at the time , Senator Teddy Kennedy . </s>
And we’ve had now really massive immigration , low-skill , low-wage workers ever since that period of time . </s>
Now whether or not those -- that cyclical movement and that cyclical characterization I just gave you of immigration was purposeful or not . It had and served a good purpose , I think . We had periods of high immigration . We had periods of low immigration . </s>
And you know what happened during the periods of low immigration ? People used that time to assimilate . And let me tell you , from my point of view , this is by far the most important aspect of the debate . </s>
Assimilation -- we can have massive amounts of immigration to this country , the right time and the right type of immigration , especially , as I say , depending upon our needs here as long as we have assimilation along with it . Or , if it doesn’t happen along with it , it has to happen at that period of time that we take a break , which is not a bad idea for us to think about even now , because assimilation is not occurring . It’s not occurring to the extent -- I mean , I know you can’t categorically say that , but it is certainly not occurring to the extent that we need it to in this country . </s>
We desperately need , perhaps more than any country in the world , we need things to hold us together , to think about as being Americans , to connect together , not pull us apart . And I’m afraid our immigration policy is doing just that . Thank you , Tom Tancredo . Our motion is `` Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . '' </s>
And here to argue against the motion , I’d like to introduce Julián Castro . He is mayor of San Antonio , Texas . </s>
He is a superstar in his party . He was the youngest , at the time , the youngest member ever elected to the San Antonio Council and is now the youngest mayor of a major U.S. city , although , Julián , you know that if you stay in that job a lot longer , people are going to stop saying that . Julián Castro : I’m already starting to get the grey hair . Ladies and gentlemen , Julián Castro . </s>
Julián Castro : Thank you all very much . Thank you . Thank you very much , and let me say thank you , John , and to everyone here at “Intelligence Squared , ” to Congressman Tancredo , Secretary Kobach , and to all the folks who showed up tonight . We appreciate being here . </s>
Tamar Jacoby and I have the distinct pleasure of arguing against the motion on the table tonight . You know , last week , I’m a little bit embarrassed to say that at 3:20 in the morning , Central Time , I woke up to flip on CNN to watch the Royal Wedding . I admit it . I couldn’t help myself . </s>
It was one of those moments that you’d just rather see live than see on tape . My wife didn’t even wake up . </s>
She stayed asleep and I woke up . And they had about two hours of coverage before the bride actually showed up on the doorstep of Westminster Abbey . And in the background of the coverage in one of the shots on ABC or CNN -- -- one of the networks that was covering it , there was laid out on a fence post , the United States flag , the flag of America . And I was surprised to see that , although it was a welcome sight . But there was something in my mind that told me that that American flag looked out of place at the Royal Wedding . </s>
And as I thought about it more , the reason that our American flag looked out of place is because our country has never been a country about royalty or caste or one 's station in life . It has always been defined as a country for the strivers , for the aspirers , for the folks who can pull themselves up by their boot straps , who are willing to take the chance , the entrepreneurs , most of whom start off as folks of lesser means , folks who make themselves . And this country , the United States , of all the countries in the world and all the countries throughout history , has defined itself as the nation that has taken in folks from around the world and allowed them to pursue their dreams , to reach their American dream and to become , from some who was poor and huddled among masses , to someone who is successful and able to enjoy the fruits of the capitalist system . And so it is that I believe we need to continue to welcome not only the wealthy but the poor from other countries . </s>
We need to do that for several reasons . The first is that immigrants are vital to our national economy . Immigrants actually found companies at almost twice the rate of native born U.S. citizens . </s>
Companies founded by immigrants in the years between 1995 and 2005 actually created 450,000 jobs in the United States of America . In one single year , they generated $ 52 billion in sales in industries like high technology and engineering ; that the number of folks who start those companies is at 25 percent nationally . </s>
And in Silicon Valley , it 's at 52.4 percent . And remember , it is a false distinction to think that the folks who found these companies start off as wealthy . Oftentimes they do n't . </s>
Think about your own experience , either in your own family , or how many times have you heard someone tell the story of their family member who came here with just a few dollars in their pocket and were able to contribute great things to this country ? Congressman Tancredo also mentioned the idea of assimilation . And I believe that it is important for folks generally to assimilate to a common culture in the United States . </s>
And that 's exactly what has been happening in the United States of America throughout our history with immigrants . </s>
What we have seen consistently , and I think that Congressman Tancredo and I agree , what we have seen is that from time to time there has been this very intense concern about balkanization . Benjamin Franklin famously said that we should rid Pennsylvania of the Germans in 1751 . We had the Alien and Sedition Act of 1798 , the Chinese Exclusion Act . </s>
We had the fear in the early 1940s during World War II that Germans and Japanese would somehow try and overthrow the government of the United States . The reason that we have succeeded as a nation , that today we are the most powerful economy in the world is that we have been able to overcome those impulses . </s>
And I believe that we need to continue to overcome those impulses for the future . </s>
It 's also incorrect to say that immigrants only take , and they do n't give . In 1993 , the Urban Institute did a study that found that 94 percent of immigrants were not on welfare and that the distinction between immigrants and natives in terms of who was on welfare was less than three percent . They also contribute up to $ 240 billion in taxes overall into Social Security and Medicare that they 're actually never going to get a chance to use . And the National Conference of State Legislatures , a few years ago , did an analysis of 16 different states . And they found that in five of those , including some of the biggest ones , New York and Texas , that there was a net positive from immigrants , including illegal immigrants , versus a negative . </s>
And so this idea that they do n't pay taxes , that they only take , that they 're on welfare , the evidence clearly demonstrates that that 's not the case . I also believe , and I anticipate that some may argue that having so many folks come to our country is not good in terms of crime . </s>
The numbers bear out that immigrant communities are actually safer than nonimmigrant communities . </s>
Terrorism , the idea that somehow there are many folks walking across our borders that are going to commit acts of terror against folks in the United States . I do n't believe that 's true , either . In fact , in 2010 , of the 463,000 apprehensions that we had in the United States , two 10,000ths of one percent were apprehensions from folks that , excluding Cuba , were from countries that were listed as a state sponsor of terror . What we 're catching really are a whole bunch of folks who are yearning to breathe free , who are chasing the same values . </s>
Congressman Tancredo asked what 's going to keep us together . What 's going to keep us together is what always has kept us together as a nation , the fact that people come here to work . They 're entrepreneurial . They believe in democracy . </s>
They 're people of good faith . They have the same values that have always made America great . </s>
And I hope we 'll continue to do so if we can get the policy right . Thank you . </s>
Julián Castro , your time is up . Thank you very much . So a reminder of where we are . </s>
We are halfway through the opening statements of this “Intelligence Squared U.S.” debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . And we have four debaters , two teams of two , fighting it out over this motion , “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses.” You have heard two of the opening statements , and now on to the third . I 'd like to introduce Kris Kobach , who is secretary of State for the State of Kansas , and who also gets around the country quite a bit consulting as a lawyer for other states on immigration laws . </s>
He was the co-author of Arizona 's controversial SB1070 . You are also defending laws -- no hissing , please . You 're also defending laws in I believe Missouri , Texas . Where else ? Nebraska . </s>
Nebraska . Pennsylvania . Pennsylvania . Now , your -- do people in Kansas think you 're not taking this secretary of State thing not seriously if you 're getting around so much ? Well , I 'm making plenty of noise there too . </s>
Okay . </s>
I just want to remind you to move a little closer to your mic . And ladies and gentlemen , Kris Kobach . Thank you . My work in terms of immigration policy at the national level began in 2001 when I served as counsel to John Ashcroft at the Justice Department . And after I left the Justice Department in 2003 , I left with a very important idea in my head and that was that the rule of law has broken down in immigration , and much had to be done to restore it . </s>
But it had to be done not only at the national level , but also at the state level . </s>
And that 's why I got involved helping states like Arizona and many other states . In 2007 for the first time , every state in the country saw legislation introduced into the state legislature to , in some way , restrict or slow down the pace of immigration into that state . Not all of them passed , but that 's an important point . </s>
Every state is a border state now . The reason that nearly all of the states on the map are trying to take steps to discourage illegal immigration is several-fold . But the number one driver is a very important point in this debate , and I 'd like to start there . The fiscal cost , fiscal cost , the cost to governments , to taxpayers to the illegal immigration in particular is unsustainable . My point can be summarized in one sentence by Nobel laureate , Milton Friedman . </s>
He said , it 's just obvious . You ca n't have open immigration and a welfare state . You ca n't have open immigration and a welfare state . Now , my guess is that there are a few fans of the welfare state here in the audience . </s>
I am not a big fan myself , I accept the reality that it 's here to stay . And given that reality , there is an important distinction that needs to be made between the current wave of immigration , which started in the '80s and has been going unabated for three decades , and all preceding waves of immigration . They were not immigrating into a welfare state . </s>
They were immigrating into a situation where they rose or they fell based on their own merits . There was no safety net to catch them . That is a critical distinction that changes everything . When Emma Lazarus wrote that poem , she spoke of a lady holding the golden -- the lamp by the golden door . Now , the golden door she was referring to was a golden door of opportunity . </s>
You come here , you 're free to do whatever you can . You make it or you lose it , but it 's all up to you . Now that golden door represents goodies , public benefits , services that are available to people who come to the United States more than any other nation in the Western hemisphere . The golden door represents something completely different . </s>
Now , aliens are consuming those benefits far more than U.S. citizens are doing so . </s>
Now , the average per household consumption -- that consumption of public services and benefits , is estimated , from a 2007 figure , not 1993 numbers , 2007 , to be $ 19,400 per year net . They 're consuming -- and this is all immigrants , the illegal and legal combined . 19,400 per year more in services than they 're paying it in taxes . So that 's a net drag on the fiscal status of the country . </s>
Now , Julián mentioned this 1993 study . I have not seen that study . That is so old I would n't even know where to begin because the numbers are so different back then . Now we 're talking 11.3 million illegal aliens in the country . </s>
There was also a study that came out last month based on census figures from 2010 , and the number was generated by the Center for Immigration Studies , crunching the numbers , 71 percent of illegal alien households are consuming some form of welfare , 52 percent of lawfully present alien-headed households are consuming some form of welfare , in contrast to only 39 percent of the U.S. citizen-headed households are consuming some form of welfare . </s>
Now , the explanation for this is obvious . It has nothing to do with ethnicity or nationality , it has everything to do with economics and demographics . Poor people are more likely to consume welfare . And immigrants coming into the United States , especially illegal immigrants , are almost in all cases having less than a high school education . If you look at all immigrants combined , about two-thirds have a high school education or less , and so we are importing a very impoverished set of immigrants , both legal and illegal , into the country . </s>
Here 's another fact to chew on . The Mexico-American border has the greatest disparity in income levels of any border on the planet . </s>
There is no other national border where the difference between the rich country and the poor country per capita is greater . That fuels a lot of this fiscal cost , too . </s>
So since 1996 , Congress has passed laws trying to discourage this handing out of public benefits because it exacerbates the problem . </s>
Most states have ignored that law . New York is one of the states that continues to give public benefits to illegal aliens . </s>
New York also gives in-state tuition rates to certain illegal aliens . </s>
Think about that if you are a -- -- well , I do n't think any of the out-of-state students who are at a public institution are clapping right now because they 're paying out-of-state tuition rates . </s>
Now , the -- nationwide , as Tom mentioned , it 's over $ 100 billion a year net that is flowing out to illegal aliens , that is to say , they 're consuming that much more in benefits than they 're paying in taxes . And the burden falls overwhelmingly at the states . Indeed , I like to say illegal immigration is the ultimate unfunded federal mandate because the federal government , which is chiefly responsible for enforcing the laws , fails to do so , and then the states have to pay the burden . You can think of story after story about this . Hazelton , Pennsylvania , one of the cities that I 'm representing , they saw their population explode from 20,000 in the year 2000 to about 30,000 five years later , 50 percent increase in population , but they get most of their revenue from an earned income tax and their revenue remained flat . </s>
Population goes up 50 percent , no additional tax revenue , that was because most of the additional people coming in were working at a meat packing plant nearby , were illegal aliens , and they were either earning too little income to pay any taxes or they were earning purely cash income . And the city was n't getting any revenues . </s>
Look what happened . </s>
All the costs to the city went up 50 percent , all the costs contingent on population . The school districts , the budget was breaking , English as a Second Language , the expenditures in 2002 were 136,000 that year . In 2006 , they went up to 1.1 million . Talk about that kind of burden on a small town school district . </s>
The same thing is happening at the national level . And as a result , we have to recognize that there is a fiscal cost . Or take it on the individual level . </s>
Look at the jobs . There are 14 million Americans out of work . </s>
A vast majority of the 11.3 illegal -- million illegal aliens have those jobs , about seven million are in the workforce . Many states are realizing the simple truth , if you want to create a real job for a U.S. citizen tomorrow , deport an illegal alien today . </s>
It actually works . But of course many of you are probably thinking , and I 'm sure we 'll hear from the other side , that those are jobs Americans wo n't do , that those are jobs that are too low on the totem pole for Americans to do . Well , the statistics do n't bear that out because in every single one of the industry -- industrial sectors where illegal aliens are prominent , U.S. citizens still have the majority of jobs there , 74 percent of construction workers , U.S. citizens , 76 percent of food preparation workers , U.S. citizens , 56 percent of agriculture laborers , U.S. citizens . </s>
The U.S. citizens are there , and they 're working right alongside the illegal aliens who are depressing the wages or taking their jobs outright . So if we care about our fiscal health , and if we care about the Americans who are struggling to put food on the table , we should look very seriously at our immigration problem in the United States . This is our motion , `` Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . '' </s>
And now here to speak against the motion , Tamar Jacoby , actually had a long career as a journalist , was a writer , a justice reporter for Newsweek , then was deputy editor of the op-ed page in The New York Times . And then you went on to write books about immigration , and now you 're running an organization called `` ImmigrationWorks USA , '' and you 're not approaching this from the left but you 're actually looking at it from the point of the small businessmen whom your organization assists and , Tamar , I just want to say I’m very glad to hear about the post- journalism career success personally . It’s very heartening . You too can go into politics . Ladies and gentleman ladies and gentleman , Tamar Jacoby . </s>
Thank you so much , and thank you so much to the sponsors of this event . So , like all of us , I’m a descendant of immigrants . </s>
In my case , there were two kinds of immigrants . </s>
On one side were the Eastern European Jews , and on the other side were the people who came on The Mayflower . So , I grew up in a house where I had two lessons . One was that difference was really kind of what made us great . </s>
It’s certainly what made the two sides of my family great . And I learned to understand later it was what made the country great . But I also learned that , in many ways , what we have in common -- this was another lesson in my household -- what we have in common is more important than our differences . </s>
And so I see the challenge for the country going forward , as it was in my family , is to make sure that balance is in the right -- is in balance , that we’re getting the benefits of the difference , but we’re also holding together as one country . And that’s where I start when I’m considering immigration . It’s not -- there have been words thrown around here : nostalgia , generosity , I’m not sure anybody mentioned rights , but that’s another way that a lot of people come at it . I don’t come at immigration from any of those perspectives . I come at it from what is in America’s interest . </s>
What’s really good for us , for our economy , for our security , and for our future ? </s>
And that’s why I’m dead set against this motion . I don’t think it’s good for our economy or for our values . So let’s start by being honest . Immigration is about economics . </s>
It’s driven by economics , for the people who get up in their home villages and come here , and it’s driven by economics for the Americans who hire them . And the bottom line is it turns out to be an economic win- win . Immigrants create jobs . </s>
And contrary to what you’ve just heard from Kris Kobach , it’s counterintuitive , I know , but you heard me right . Immigrants create jobs . It’s easy to see how that works on the high end . The 25 percent of the patents in the United States that are taken out by people who are foreign-born , the 25 percent of the doctors in America who are foreign-born , the 25 percent of the nurses , the half of all of our science and engineering Ph.D.s who are foreign-born . And you heard it from my partner , Julián , the quarter of the tech startups that were started by foreign-born . </s>
As in the past , countries competed -- powerful countries competed for coal and iron-ore in colonies . Today , countries around the world are competing for high-end engineers and smart immigrants . But it’s true at the low end , too , that immigrants create jobs . And again , I know this gets even more counterintuitive , but , you know , I’ll never forget here -- and this is really what partly brought me to do exactly what I’m doing now -- -- hearing the man who ran a seafood processing plant on the Eastern Shore of Maryland talk about his company . </s>
He came to the floor of the Senate and he did this . He talked about how he had a 100-year-old family company . The native born people on the Eastern Shore no longer wanted to do the hard seasonal work . Americans like full -- year-round jobs . </s>
No one wanted to do the hard seasonal work of picking the crab out of the shell . So he brought Mexican women every summer to pick those crabs out of the shell -- very low-paid , uneducated people , seasonal workers . You know , that’s the low end of the economic totem pole . But because he had those seasonal workers , he could actually keep his company open in a way that he wouldn’t have been able to if he didn’t have them . </s>
And because he kept his company open , there was a job for the manager in the company and the people who packaged the seafood and the accountant in the company . And because he could keep his company open , there was seafood for the restaurants in the town where the tourists came to eat seafood . And because those restaurants and the seafood , hotels , gas stations , insurers , you can get the picture -- up and down the food chain , those lowly , lowest bottom-of-the-totem seafood pickers were keeping an economy going . </s>
And the point is that on both the top and the bottom end of our economy , the bottom of the skill ladder and the top of the skill ladder , we have holes that needs filling by a foreign workforce . The American workforce is changing . </s>
We’re getting older . People are -- we’re having smaller families . People are retiring sooner . We’ve created -- we have holes at the top and bottom of the workforce , and we’re lucky that they’re filled by immigrants who , because they’re different from Americans , either more or less skilled , they’re complementary , not competitive . </s>
They create jobs for Americans . Of course , there are costs , and we’ll talk more about the costs in this -- I don’t deny there are costs to immigration , but in the long run , ultimately , the good far outweighs the bad . </s>
Our need for workers also changes . </s>
That’s not so -- in a bad economy , we need fewer foreign workers and in a good economy , we need more . But ultimately , the point is the patents , those PhDs , the startups and the jobs for U.S. workers up and down the food chain . And the 64 million question for me is how are we as a country going to handle what I think is a given of the interconnected world . We 're lucky immigrants are coming to fill these niches at the top and bottom of our economy . And how are we going to handle it in a way that 's consistent with our values , that maximizes the benefits , minimizes the cost and is consistent with our values ? </s>
And this is really where I differ from my opponents in this debate . I too am for the rule of law . I too am for security and effective enforcement . But I also think we need to be honest about our needs . It does n't really work I do n't think to have two signs at the border , one that says , `` Help wanted , '' -- one that says , `` Keep Out '' and one that says `` Help Wanted . '' </s>
I do n't think that 's an honest standup way to go about our business . </s>
I do n't think we want to treat the people who come to work for us -- I think we want to treat them in an honest , standup way . We do n't want to say , `` Wink , wink , nudge , nudge , come on in '' when times are good and then harass them with policing laws when times are bad to so that they leave . Ultimately , that 's what I think today 's debate is about . It 's about how to do we deal with the reality of our economic needs in a way that 's consistent with our values ? </s>
And if you listen tonight , what I think you should be asking yourself is whose way is more likely to lead to a successful immigration and successful integration or assimilation ? Is the best way accepting reality , allowing people to be here legally , treating them with dignity , or is the best way pretending that we do n't need these workers , pretending that we can drive them out when we ca n't and driving them further underground ? Thank you . </s>
Tamar Jacoby . </s>
And that concludes round one , opening statements of this “Intelligence Squared” debate . </s>
So here 's where we are . We are past opening statements , and we 're about to go into round two , and that 's where the debaters address each other one on one . They take questions from me . And after a little bit , we 'll take questions from you as well . And I want to , again , urge you , when you 're formulating your question , to really think in terms of something that 's terse and on the point and that really is a question . </s>
So if it has a question mark at the end of it that 's there appropriately , that 's the telltale sign that it 's functioning as a question . What I 'm trying to discourage is your debating with the debaters , but to throw something in here that would actually make them continue to hash out the issues . So I 've got to do this part for radio . And I 'll do this from time to time . I just need to do a little make believe welcome backs kind of thing , and we 're taking a break , even though we really wo n't . </s>
So it would be a great help to me if you could do a round of applause that -- that will play coming back from a break in the radio broadcast , and then I 'll start talking . Thanks very much for doing this . Go ahead . So we are back , and now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly . </s>
I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We 're at an “Intelligence Squared U.S.” debate at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . Our motion is “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses.” We have two teams of two members each who have been arguing it out . </s>
The team arguing for the motion says that we 're working under an out-of-control immigration system where the wrong people are getting in the wrong way and exploiting America 's generosity , while also , in some cases , diluting America 's American-ness . The other side is arguing that immigration may need some fixing but that it is vital for the U.S. economy . And they 're also arguing that immigration actually is the American story . So I 'd like to go to the side that is arguing for the motion , arguing do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . </s>
And Tom Tancredo , you were talking about the notion that right now we 're importing poverty . </s>
And I want to ask you , who is welcome ? </s>
Who are the immigrants that are welcome ? Well , certainly , you could establish an immigration policy based upon the needs of the country in an economic sense . </s>
And that is a determination I think that we have made many times during our past . Are our needs primarily low-skill , low-wage workers , or are they with high skilled . The people that Tamar and the mayor referred to as being these startup companies , these affluent -- or at least people who became affluent , had all these skills , great , fine . </s>
It 's wonderful . But I 'm telling you that that 's not what our immigration policy is today . Today it is based almost entirely on something called family unification . </s>
And because we 've had so many people coming into the country over such a long period of time from such low-skilled , low-wage backgrounds that that 's who we get . And take 30 -- 15 seconds to describe the dynamic of family unification . Well , sure . It 's , if you get here , once you get here and get status here , status as someone here legally , you can begin the process of bringing in your family , bringing in the immediate family then bringing in extended family . </s>
And the problem being ? Being it 's coming exactly from the same group of people , the same economic group , especially , that is predominantly low-skilled , low-wage workers when we have , right now , at least -- by the way , this is also legal -- I 'm talking legal immigration . As well . Let alone the people that are coming across the borders illegally . Not many of those people have these kinds of skills that you 're talking about that are so desperately needed . </s>
Okay . Let 's do a response from the other side . Julián Castro is mayor of San Antonio . Julián Castro : Thank you very much . </s>
First , the argument is built on this idea again that immigrants , both legal and illegal , are somehow soaking up welfare payments and other state subsidies which is not borne out by the evidence . </s>
I would also say that last week , folks may have seen this news story . The Internal Revenue Service , the IRS , reported that 45 percent of households in this tax year will pay nothing in federal income taxes . So are we to say then that they have no value either because they 're not paying any federal income tax . It 's interesting that you mention that because , of course , when we also start talking about the taxes that immigrants and even people who are here illegally pay , there is -- your side suggests that they 're paying their fair share . But in reality , they pay nothing in terms of income taxes . </s>
Most of the people we 're talking about end up getting income tax credit and therefore money back from the federal government because again , it 's low-skilled , low-wage work . And low-skilled , low-wage people do n't pay income taxes . They usually pay -- they pay sales taxes and that sort of thing . But it never balances off with -- </s>
Julián Castro . -- the costs we incur for the infrastructure we provide . </s>
Julián Castro . </s>
Julián Castro : Let 's just be precise here . </s>
They do pay state income taxes and in some cases federal income taxes . They also pay sales taxes any time they go and buy something . They pay hotel occupancy taxes every time they go to a motel or a hotel . They pay car rental taxes when they rent a car . They pay all types of fees to the government that help the government run and also patronize businesses and spend their money . </s>
And they have a tremendous economic impact on every local community . They do . Let me ask Kris Kobach -- That is true . </s>
And economic impacts are not positive . Tom , let me bring in your -- let me bring in your partner . </s>
Kris Kobach , I just want -- Kris , I just want you to respond to what we just heard because I think that 's news to a lot of people , a long list of taxes in fact which the immigrants are paying . </s>
True or not ? </s>
It is true that aliens , legal and illegal , of course , pay sales taxes . They indirectly pay property taxes . They may pay some income taxes if they 're working under a false Social Security number . I 'm talking about the illegal aliens here . Which , by the way , they 'll never be able to claim . </s>
But the fiscal impact is undisputed . Now , there are some economic studies that look at the overall impact . Have we cheapened the price of some goods ? </s>
Have we given some economic benefits ? But if you narrow it to the fiscal impact , it is undisputed . Every single study in the last 10 years , whether you 're talking about Robert Rector 's study in 2007 or the Census Bureau numbers that I related just a moment ago where you have seven , eight percent of illegal aliens consuming welfare programs , 51 percent of legal aliens and 39 percent of U.S. citizens , which , by the way , matches up well with that 40 percent figure . </s>
It shows statistically that they are consuming the fiscal benefits . </s>
And if you just look at in terms of the benefit to us as taxpayers , we 're losing on -- Okay . Let 's go to Tamar Jacoby , your opponent . I mean , again , it all just depends on how you measure it and how you look at it . If you look at it most immigrants pay their taxes to the federal level because they have their income tax withheld from their paycheck . </s>
So if you look not just at the state level , but the federal level as well , and you look over their whole lifetimes , they actually pay in about as much as they take out because what costs is health and education -- Let me finish . </s>
Let me finish . </s>
The cost is health and education . But then they turn into earners and taxpayers . And so if you look over their whole lives , if you look at the federal story as well , it 's about an even-even . Social Security , they pay in every year about $ 7 billion that they do n't take out because they pay in on -- illegal immigrants pay in on Social Security numbers , and they do n't recoup the costs . </s>
So they get to keep the -- But your opponents have made the case that in other ways that immigrants and illegal immigrants especially are drawing on the welfare system . Well , they 're exaggerating their welfare numbers . But let me just make my -- 2010 census . </s>
Let me just make a closing point . </s>
The point is that what you 're leaving out is growth , is the growth they make possible . Okay . </s>
And let me just give you a couple numbers . </s>
So in the State of North Carolina , they measured over the '90s , what an immigrants -- what was the fiscal cost and what was the growth made possible in consumption and adding to businesses . Fiscal costs over 10 years , $ 61 million . Now , that 's real money , that 's those costs by Latinos coming to the States -- growth , growth , 11 billion -- </s>
All right . </s>
Tamar , I -- we see where you 're going with the growth -- Growth , 11 billion . -- take it , but I want your opponents to respond to your earlier point . </s>
That rightwing organization , the National Academy of Sciences , I mean , will you accept that as a legitimate entity that assesses these issues ? </s>
I mean , it does n't have -- to the best of my knowledge , it does n't have a dog in this fight , it does n't have a political bone to pick with anybody . It 's the National Academy of Sciences . You can argue with the -- with CIS and other studies , but the National Academy of Sciences shows that you 're not correct , Tamar , when you suggest that this is n't a fiscal drain on this country . It most certainly is . That 's not what that study found . </s>
It is also just common sense , it 's not even something that you have to go through reams of statistical evidence to prove it is common sense . If you come here without an ability to provide a service that is well paid for you are not going to be able to pay the income taxes you 're talking about , but you are undeniably going to require the services , the services for your children , the children who are in the public school system , the services for the -- the social services -- And I consider educating the workforce of the future -- </s>
-- the social service benefits . </s>
I consider educating the workforce for the future not as a welfare benefit but an investment . Yeah , or in the day today . Tamar cedes some time to her colleague , Julián Castro . </s>
Sure , an investment . Well , okay , how about the investment in our prison system ? Tom , Tom , Tom , I want to bring in Julián Castro . Julián Castro : Well , what Congressman Tancredo may remember as well is that in 2006 the Republican State Comptroller of Texas did an analysis that said that -- that analyzed how much revenue -- state revenue had been generated by illegal immigrants and found it at $ 1.58 billion and said that $ 1.16 billion in state resources had been taken by illegal immigrants , and so this idea that it is just is so clear cut across the country , that 's not true . </s>
Kris Kobach . I with that study , that Texas Comptroller study looked -- it did n't just look at fiscal income and outgo , then they went on and considered , `` Well , have there been generations in second and third degree effects of extra businesses or extra -- </s>
Right . </s>
-- consumption that might have occurred ? '' Now , that 's fine , and look , let 's get this straight , the fiscal debate is clear , they are a fiscal drag . Now , I will agree that there are - - we get cheaper vegetables because of this , but you have to realize there are winners and there are losers . The winners are the employers who are able to exploit the illegal labor , the losers are the consumer -- the winners are the consumers of some goods who really want that extra two pennies off the price of a head of lettuce , but the losers are the U.S. citizens who lose their jobs , the U.S. citizens who are still working in those fields and are getting paid a lower wage , and the taxpayers . There 's no doubt the taxpayers are the losers . </s>
None of this is true , that no economists -- -- no economists looking for a wage effect , there’s been people studying it for 20 years , even the most -- George Borjas -- -- yeah -- </s>
2007 . -- has found that over 20 years there 's a less than five percent wage effect for the people at the very -- for a high school dropout . So you can see there is a wage effect . </s>
And other -- economists challenge him and say -- I agree . -- it’s less than one percent , and other economists who studied it say that so the division is between over 20 years for the -- only the 10 percent of Americans who drop out of high school , that for them it’s between one and four , and for everyone else it’s actually gains is wages -- </s>
Can I see if we agree on this point ? -- for everyone else it’s gains in wages because having low skilled people there makes the productivity of the higher workers go up . </s>
So do we agree on -- do we agree on the Borjas numbers ? Says that if you have a 10 percent increase in the number of laborers in a given industrial sector you will have in the short term a decrease in wages of seven to eight percent , and in the long term a decrease in wages of three to four percent , in the long term . So we agree on that , they can decide whether that 's significant or not . Three to four , three to four . </s>
I think that’s significant . For other high school dropouts . Julián Castro , you -- no , no -- </s>
Julián , you heard your opponent . Moving on to a different part of this argument , and that’s the assimilation argument , your opponent 's raising the concern that the wave of immigrants that we’re talking about for the most part , poor immigrants and illegal immigrants as well , that they’re not coming -- they’re not really becoming part of the culture . They come to dip their toes and to remain speaking Spanish and to remain with the dream of going back home ultimately and not really buying in . </s>
Can you take that on ? Julián Castro : Sure , I’d say first that it’s been a common theme in American history , this impulse to believe that anyone who is other than the dominant majority is somehow going to poison the culture . And look at us all these years later as a nation , we are a very strong nation , we’re the number one economy in the world . </s>
We’re a nation where folks are learning English , where they are participating in democracy . You know , in my own family , for instance , just anecdotally , my grandmother that I grew up with , came to the United States when she was very young from Mexico , and tonight I’m speaking perfect English , not Spanish , so . By the way , I hear your Spanish is pretty terrible . </s>
Julián Castro : My English is about 100 times better than my Spanish , and really the idea is not that , you know -- the idea is that you see a common trajectory , no matter whether it’s the Germans that Benjamin Franklin was talking about , the Chinese that we tried to exclude , you know , the French that we were , we passed the Alien Sedition Act for , or today , the Hispanic culture , folks embrace America -- Right , but I think your opponents are arguing it in several ways . </s>
This time it’s different . </s>
And I want to go back to Tom Tancredo . And why is it different ? </s>
It would be exactly the same , quite frankly , if the numbers were close . What I mean by that is this -- all during the period of time that we talk about as being the heyday of immigration to this country , we of course witnessed exactly what you say in terms of people coming here and being , you know , sort of sequestered or put in -- or sequestering themselves . I mean , it didn’t always happen because we forced it that way . You know , groups settled where they were comfortable , settled in what we call ghettos sometimes . </s>
But that’s natural . It’s a natural phenomenon . They’re going to look for the people that they know , the language they understand , the customs and habits that they’re familiar with , perfectly natural . What happened in the past is that the numbers allowed for , and also the timeouts that I mentioned earlier , allowed for an assimilation process . </s>
Even if people didn’t want to , they were almost forced into it in order to get ahead in the country . </s>
Of course , there was the issue of English . My grandparents , I can remember so distinctly my grandmother and grandfather in the back seat of the car , Sunday afternoon drive , after a couple of hours , they had been together for probably long enough in close proximity so they started to argue about things . And my grandfather would lapse into Italian and my grandmother would yell at him , “Speak American , dammit ! ” </s>
And it was her purpose , and it -- But why are you saying that’s not happening in the Mexican communities as well ? Because the numbers today are so high of people coming from a particular area into a geographic area that bring the culture -- </s>
You’re saying there’s a critical mass -- you’re saying there’s a critical mass in this case that makes it different -- </s>
That makes is much more difficult to assimilate . I just want to see what the other side’s response to that . </s>
People in the second generation , even among poor -- children of poor Mexicans , everyone learns English . And the third generation , three-quarters of the people can’t speak Spanish anymore , can’t speak to their grandmother . People are learning English as they did in the past . No , it’s not , Tamar . Where I want to shift the conversation is , I believe that the policies of our opposing team would actually make integration or assimilation harder , not easier . </s>
They want to keep people on the wrong side of the law , not let them make restitution and get right with the law and come into society . They want to end birthright citizenship so that the children of immigrants grow up not as citizens , which every study that’s looked at it has shown makes the parents less likely to learn the language and integrate . </s>
All right , before you go through your list , I’d like to give them a chance to respond . Kris Kobach ? There are -- obviously , assimilation has occurred and obviously assimilation can occur in the future in America . But assimilation doesn’t happen automatically . </s>
As Tom mentioned , you have to have -- there’s a tipping point . </s>
If the percentage of the immigrant population is so high and is so disproportionately speaking one language or sharing one culture , then the pressure from the rest of us , the rest of the American society , on that group to assimilate is lower . </s>
Kris , the point that was just made by your -- the point that was just made was , for example , a policy that you mentioned before of denying in-state tuition prices to immigrants actually acts to stifle assimilation because those are going to be kids who won’t be going to school . Well , actually , it’s to encourage people to leave and comply with the law and go home . That’s the idea . </s>
Now , but let me -- let me give one more point on assimilation , and that is one of the greatest engines of assimilation -- I think we can all agree on this -- is the public schools . In the past for the last 100 years or so , the public schools have been the primary engine of assimilation . That engine is not working anymore . According to a study done at a high school in San Diego , I think in 2002 or 2003 , after three years of high school , the proportion of students self-identifying themselves as Americans went down 50 percent . The proportion saying they were hyphenated Americans , in other words , Mexican- American or something like that , went down 30 percent . </s>
And the number that they were saying they are a foreign nationality after three years of high school went up 52 percent . And that study was done in the middle of the battle over Prop 187 , which was denying benefits to immigrants -- That was in 1994 . -- had commercials on TV saying stop them coming -- I know the study you’re talking about , Rumbaugh’s study , and what he was showing was that when there’s an anti-immigrant climate , people get alienated and identify with their group . </s>
And that’s exactly what I would argue your side is creating , is an anti-immigrant climate that drives people to identify with their group and not assimilate . Do you see the logic ? </s>
I just want to -- I’m not taking sides , but Tamar Jacoby has presented a logical explanation there . </s>
I’d just like you to take it on . Tom Tancredo . Sure , the logical argument is this : If people come into this country illegally , especially illegally , we should all go , huh , well , you 're an immigrant , and therefore we should be happy about the fact you 're here . We should not -- we should not raise our concerns about it . We should not say that people should come into the country the legal way . </s>
There is a door . 180 -- 165,000 people a month come in today still legally . </s>
We are the most liberal country in the world regarding to legal immigration . But the minute we start talking about the fact that people are violating American laws to get here , that 's all of a sudden making it an uncomfortable place for immigrants . Well , bologna . I will not accept the idea that you ca n't talk the rule of law and be critical of people coming into this country illegally . </s>
I agree with you that illegal immigration -- I agree with you -- What 's wrong with that ? -- that illegal immigration is not what the country wants . And I agree with you -- </s>
But you want to grant an amnesty . that we need enforcement of the rule of law . </s>
But the problem is our system makes it hard to enter legally , and we do n't have enough places for the workers we need . </s>
And then we make it easy to enter illegally . </s>
A million -- a little over a million and a quarter people coming legally every year . And by the way , as you know , Tamar , the number of visas that are allowable for people to come here and work in the agricultural arena , H-2A , I believe , are unlimited . Right there you could have 10 million people come tomorrow and on their visas . But they do n't . </s>
You do n't because -- I want to bring in -- Just a moment . -- Julián Castro has not been heard from for more than four minutes , and I would like to - - which is rare for a politician . </s>
You do n't have that because -- </s>
Tom , let me -- More than four minutes , and you have . All right . Okay . </s>
Julián Castro : Yeah , a few months ago , the census released its 2010 figures . And I believe that the population was somewhere around 308 million . And the number of illegal immigrants in our country has been pegged at 11 million . Now , you know , almost half of those folks are not Mexicans . And so this idea that somehow one and a half percent of this population of folks who are illegal , or even if you take three percent , are going to Balkanize the United States of America is just absolutely ridiculous . </s>
In fact , I 've seen in San Antonio the effective generations of what has happened with the waves of Hispanic immigrants . San Antonio is now the seventh largest city in the United States , the second largest city in Texas . It has a very robust local economy , so much so that during these last couple of years and Forbes and others have ranked it as one of the most successful US cities . </s>
But Julián , can you address -- and to a degree , your partner did . But the numbers that your opponent Kris Kobach brought out about the number of kids in public schools who are identifying as not American , do you think that 's solely down to an anti-immigrant climate from the debate , because they obviously do n't . I 'd like to see what you think about that . </s>
Julián Castro : Well , first , I have n't seen that study . But Secretary Kobach said that that was from a San Diego high school . The first thing is I would question the sample and the breadth of that study . I do n't think that you can draw many conclusions from one high school in the United States , one class . But think about your own lives and the folks that you 've met here in New York or wherever you 've gone . </s>
Folks are very proud to be Americans . They came here for a reason . </s>
They came here to get ahead . They come here because of what America stands for . My experience has been that people very much identify themselves and are proud to be Americans . Just look at the names of the people who are fighting and dying in our wars . </s>
Hispanics are a representative proportion to their proportion of the population . These are newcomers , and they 're fighting and dying for us . </s>
Here legally . </s>
Kris Kobach . He says they 're not . Here legally and are U.S. citizens -- </s>
Yeah . -- primarily . But let me correct a number Julián mentioned . Kris Kobach . </s>
The census bureau , the actual number , you’re right , 308 million total people residing in America , approximately 36 million are aliens , and that includes legal and illegal . So it 's about 12 percent -- Julián Castro : Well , here you go -- -- of the population . And that is basically -- Julián Castro : Kris , I mean , you 're switching between legal and illegal and making some arguments only for legal . Okay , here , look . </s>
It 's 11.1 -- 11 . -- Julián Castro : You ca n't have it both ways . That 's the point . </s>
-- million is illegal . You do the math . </s>
That is a good question . Are you guys against just illegal immigration , or are you against immigration , period ? I 'm telling you what we are in favor of is increasing the percentage of aliens who are exactly the ones you 're talking about , the job creators , the entrepreneurs that are starting the companies . The way you increase that percentage is you reduce illegal immigration to zero , and you change our priorities about legal immigration , and you give higher preference to people who are skilled . </s>
And who -- We can accept the cream of the crop , and we should . And who 's going to grow our food ? And who 's going to take care of our old people ? And who 's going to work in hospitals ? </s>
Well , the 14 million unemployed Americans would be a starter . Okay . </s>
I 'd like to go to questions from the audience . And the way that this works , the lights will come up , and if you raise your hand , I 'll find you , and then a microphone will be brought to you . We 'd like you to stand up so that the camera can find you . </s>
Really , if you could keep your question to one sentence or two sentences , I mean , try to formulate it -- I 'm okay with a brief statement of premise , but we would like to keep it terse . </s>
And hold the mic about a fist 's distance from your mouth . And this gentleman in the front row in a blue shirt ? Hi . Yes . </s>
Actually , the mayor of New York City , Michael Bloomberg , he 's been talking a lot about an immigration policy that will allow a lot more individuals to come in from all different classes , but that would be focused on having these immigrants come in a little bit more quickly , a little bit easier if they would agree to stay in cities that are necessarily in decline like Detroit for a period of two to three years , five years . I 'm just curious . Does that change any positions on either side ? </s>
And could that be a viable plan that could maybe bring -- So he’s saying there is a place . Kris Kobach , do you want to -- </s>
Mayor of Detroit has already responded to that , I think . Yeah , Mayor Bloomberg , you notice he did n't suggest that the illegal aliens come to any particular borough of New York . And the citizens of Detroit were n't asked whether -- you know , they 're facing unemployment -- whether they would like a large number of unskilled folks to come in and help revive their economy by taking a job they 're already - - Julián Castro . Okay , Tamar Jacoby then Julián . </s>
You can make light of this , but I mean , it 's true . Go to any immigrant neighborhood , they revitalize the neighborhoods . They open shops . They open restaurants . </s>
They 've taken burnt out neighborhoods across the country and revitalized them on the same way they create small businesses , and they 're -- and they 're consumers . Yes , I do n't know if we really want to send them all to Detroit . But the truth is immigrants bring economic vitality , and they create jobs . </s>
Julián Castro . He 's on to something . Julián Castro : First , as I said earlier , the studies have shown that immigrants as a class have a higher rate of founding businesses than native born U.S. votes . Mayor Bloomberg is correct , and that 's why he has made the economic argument very powerfully for both more legal immigration and then doing something with the 11 million folks who are here illegally . </s>
It is not realistic that you 're going to deport 11 million people because it would decimate the American economy and because -- and this is n't about dollars and cents , but because these people are human beings . </s>
They 're human beings . Tom Tancredo , do you want to weigh in on this ? Yeah . </s>
What our opponents have done here is very skillful , really great at it , and I give them credit for setting up all kinds of straw man arguments , you know , that if you are opposed to immigration , you do n't understand that some people who are coming here are patriots and want to be -- well , of course , it 's absolutely true . Nobody 's suggesting that every single immigrant comes here under that premise . But the idea that you -- when you say you ca n't deport , I do n't have any -- I have never once , in as many millions of words as I have expended on this topic , suggested everybody 's got to be deported . </s>
All I 've ever said is , look , all you have to do is obey the law . All you have to do is restrict the ability of a employer to give a job to somebody who is here illegally . </s>
People self-deport when that happens . It happened in Arizona . You do not have to round people up . These are all cannards . These are all things that people on the other say to make it look as though we 're all people who are just waiting and biding our time until we can get these people out of our country . </s>
That 's -- Your policy is even worse than deportation . Why is it hard to suggest that obeying the law would be a good way to deal with -- Tamar Jacoby . </s>
-- the immigration problem ? How do you -- what 's the deal ? The theory behind this policy -- the theory behind the policy that Tom Tancredo and Kris Kobach are advocates for is called attrition through enforcement . It 's , let 's make immigrants ' lives so miserable that they go home of their own accord . First of all , it does n't work . </s>
Many immigrants who are here , the unauthorized immigrants , are people who have been here for five years , 10 years , 20 years , who own homes , who own businesses , who are married to legal Americans . They have citizen children . You might get a few to go home . But most are not going to go home . </s>
And honestly , I do n't think that 's how we want to deal with this population . These are people who we said , `` nudge , nudge , wink , wink , come on in . Do some work for us.” </s>
Do n't say `` we . '' And now we 're saying , let 's make their lives so miserable that -- Does it work , Kris Kobach ? -- it will drive them home . I do n't think that 's the way to deal with that . </s>
Statistically -- statistically , attrition through enforcement works . </s>
And it 's basically the idea . It 's the same law enforcement approach you have . You have a section of highway 95 where there are no police officers patrolling . </s>
You do n't say , well , the only options are to have an amnesty , i.e. , have no speed limit , or to catch 100 percent of the speeders . No . Which would mean to -- But Kris , I do n't want our eyes to glaze over with the answer . Okay . </s>
But when you say -- when you say statistically , can you give us a sense of what you mean ? Yeah . We have the numbers . Arizona , more than any other state , has tried to encourage people to leave . </s>
Give disincentives . Take away public benefits . </s>
From middle of 2008 to middle of 2009 , the overall illegal alien population in the United States dropped seven percent . Arizona -- In Arizona , in dropped 18 percent , more than double the national average . </s>
But most of them did n't go home . The only difference was the enforcement . But most of them did n't go home . They went to other neighboring states right next to -- Then why did the Mexican -- why did the Mexicans – why did the Mexican state of Sonora… </s>
That proves their point , though . You want to get out of Arizona . </s>
That 's true , but it does make the point that they . </s>
Why did president -- -- many of these people anymore . Mexico , they’ve been out of Mexico for 10 or 15 or more years , they 're married to Americans , they have citizen children , Mexico 's not home anymore . </s>
They leave and go to Oklahoma . Okay . I 'm getting in my ear to go to some more questions and there 's a woman in the fourth row , and thank you . Good evening , everyone . I just want to start out quoting another Nobel Laureate , it was Elie Wiesel who said in the ’80s , who in documented immigrants gave the slogan , “No human being is illegal.” </s>
And I think that 's a really brilliant place from which to start because sometimes we see that our laws have inhumane consequences . </s>
But my question is for Kris Kobach , how do you explain working for a designated hate group , the Federation for American Immigration Reform , founded by white nationalist John Tanton , who was recently profiled in The New York Times ? How do you explain the hate speech ? </s>
Okay , I 'm -- you two can talk afterwards . It 's not on our -- -- and I 'm not disrespecting the question or its validity or the conversation you two can have afterwards , it 's not on our topic . I 'd like to answer one her points , though . The designation , by the way , is by the Southern Poverty Law Center which designates lots of people lots of things , but the bit about no human being being illegal , the reason I use the term `` illegal alien '' or `` alien unlawfully present in the United States , '' is those are the terms used by federal law , and being a lawyer , I try to use the terms used by law . The word `` undocumented immigrant '' does not appear anywhere in the entire United States Code . </s>
Okay . the term `` undocumented worker '' does not appear . We take the point . I thought I saw a hand . </s>
Sir , with the yellow tie , goldish , I 'm not that good on the colors . Thank you . I noticed that Mr. Kobach is a professor of constitutional law , and yet he 's advocating that states have their own immigration policy . </s>
Do you not understand the Constitution you 're trying to teach ? I understand that perfectly well . I understand it perfectly well and -- I 'm again close to saying do you want to take this ? </s>
I 'd love to take it , because , yeah . I think he does . Because these questions really are a lot of fun -- I’ve got -- but -- -- now , let me just -- </s>
We 've got people here who have committed to really making arguments on the issue . Let me try to make this interesting because that 's what a constitutional law professor does . Really fast . </s>
Really , no , the question -- the doctrine you 're talking about is preemption doctrine . That is the idea that some things that Congress can only do and some things that they -- and the states can do alongside Congress . </s>
The United States Supreme Court last opined on this in 1976 about a California immigration law and said , yes , the states can do things to discourage illegal immigration . There is a case before the United States Supreme Court right now , Whiting versus Chamber of Commerce , we should have a decision within the next month or so , this will be the first time the Supreme Court has spoken in 35 years . </s>
So the precedents are very clearly there , and that 's why many of these cases , the states and cities are winning . </s>
Okay , can I ask -- -- just in phrasing the questions to restrain the tendency to want to attack the , you know , ad hominem -- -- please ? Because it -- I know you can take it but it’s not what we want to do . If you stand up . Oh no , no , no , you 've got to get to a microphone first . </s>
Can you hear me ? No , no , you get a mic . Yeah , wow . Even the radio listeners could hear you on that one . </s>
You have been tossing around this statistic about 11 million immigrants , illegal immigrants in this country and then you tossed something in about it dropped , you know , so many percentages , what illegal immigrant is telling you that he’s illegal ? And where are these statistics coming from ? Okay . It 's really interesting , the census has what’s called a current population survey and they do these every month and they do a really big one in March . </s>
And they actually give them to everybody and illegal aliens answer these surveys . And so they’re based on very large surveys done by the Census Bureau . And those numbers , the 11.3 million , those are generally agreed upon numbers by both the Pew Center and by the Center for Immigration Studies so I think there’s broad agreement -- Tamar Jacoby ? </s>
No , I 'm just going to say the same thing . Same thing , you agree on something ? Okay . Something technical , we agree on something technical . </s>
It 's very technical . You have a white collar and I believe gray shirt -- oh , it’s a white collared gray shirt . Earlier the mayor made a point that if you look into the future and you treat not just the snapshot of the economy but actually the dynamic picture of the economy , you see immigrants not just as one person , but as a pyramid of people who can contribute to the economy over many generations . </s>
Why do you folks on the pro side of this question always look at the snapshot and never at the long term picture ? </s>
Interesting question . Because I think , you know -- -- if many of the people in this room , if our immigrant descendants had come here now you would send them home . But in fact over the many generations we’ve contributed to this cause . </s>
Tom Tancredo . </s>
I think I at least attempted to address that when I spoke earlier when I talked about these periods of timeout . </s>
In fact , we have had immigrants -- immigration is an important part of America . </s>
There is nothing -- there is no argument about that . It’s just that it was rational over American history to create an immigration policy that fit the time , that fit the economic situation in the country . That’s exactly what happened in the 1890s and the 1900s , massive immigration , low-skilled people . Fine , worked , it’s okay . </s>
And so you can say over a long period of time , it worked . Well , it would work again today except that we have never had this timeout . And we continue to bring in the same category , low-skilled , low-wage worker , even though we don’t have enough jobs . </s>
Okay , that’s an argument that has a logic to it , and , sir , I just want to know what your -- we need a mic back to you , and briefly , if you can rise again . </s>
Did you hear it ? Yeah , I don’t think that really answers the question . The question , again , is why are we looking only at a snapshot and not at the full intergenerational contribution that immigrants and their families make ? </s>
Okay , he’s really saying why is it -- why are you not saying that 30 years from now , those folks that are here now , and you’re saying in an inappropriate time could not actually end up contributing . I think that’s what you’re saying , it’s a dynamic thing . What do we -- 30 years from now , could things be better ? </s>
Yeah . </s>
I mean , who’s supposed to be able to make that determination ? And why would we begin to think about creating -- exacerbating a problem we have today , a massive problem , with unemployment in this country -- 10 , well , nobody knows the real percentage . Well , let’s settle on what’s generally talked about as the real unemployment in America , at 10 percent -- why would we tell all those people who are unemployed today , that they’re going to have to figure out a way to think about their lives as being better in the long run because they can’t get a job today . Okay , Tamar Jacoby . I mean , it makes no sense . </s>
Tamar Jacoby . The problem with your arguments -- with our opponents’ arguments about integration and assimilation is they’re all based on hypotheticals . There’s no timeout . There was a timeout in the past . </s>
There’s too much welfare , that we didn’t have so much welfare in the past . But you’re not looking at the empirical evidence of whether today’s immigrants are integrating , and they are . </s>
99.9 percent of the children are learning English . Even in the first generation , the home ownership rates and the wealth accumulation rise to Americans of similar background . They’re owning homes . They’re starting businesses . </s>
They fighting our wars , and they’re integrating . Okay , I’m hearing from Tom Tancredo . He’s disagreeing with your points down the line . Almost every single study on this -- this is one of the -- another area where there is some degree of agreement in the number of studies out there . </s>
Hispanic immigrants in America -- although Hispanics make economic and educational gains from the first to the second generation , not disputed , the progress stops there . </s>
Third-generation Hispanics still earn significantly less than whites , graduate from college at less than 50 percent of whites , and , by the way , in terms of language , still do not accept English as the primary language , even at the third generation . That’s just not true . Julián Castro : That’s just not accurate . </s>
Come on . Well , that’s -- okay . So we have another argument about statistics . John Donvan : We have an impasse on that . </s>
There’s a -- ma’am in the third row . Yeah , there’s a -- if you look to your left , that mic’s closer . And if you could stand , thanks . Hi , I’m -- Could you -- would you mind standing up for the camera ? </s>
Thanks so much . Sorry . I’m wondering whether the premise should be concentrating on immigrants . Why are we not -- for job losses -- first of all , legal or illegal , why are we not concentrating on companies that export the jobs into the third world or the companies like GE that are allowed to take their disbursements and costing this country -- Okay , I -- </s>
No , but it has to do with immigrants because it is not about -- it’s pennywise and pound foolish . I agree , I agree . I agree that there’s a serious tension there , but it’s not going to move our discussion along . </s>
But thank you . I say that respectfully . Well , but there is actually something to say about this . Can I just -- can I say something to that ? </s>
It’s not about -- I’m not going to talk about -- I’m going to talk about immigration , I promise you , I promise you . Save it for your closing remarks . </s>
And for many industries , the choice is actually do we send the jobs abroad or do we have the immigrants come here ? For , in agriculture , if immigrants don’t come here , I guarantee you , Americans are not going to go out into the fields and pick lettuce and pick fruit . We will start outsourcing -- The majority of employees in those fields are Americans right now . We will start outsourcing agriculture . </s>
According to the census , the majority -- 56 percent are Americans in those fields right now . </s>
Okay , so ma’am , you did have a good question . </s>
I acknowledge . Sir ? But they’re supervisors , not the workers . I don’t see how our latest economic pitfalls of -- with the tours that we’re running and the enormous deficit are caused by -- how are the immigrants , illegal or legal are a drag to our economy or to causing a drag on our economy ? </s>
Well , see , you heard the numbers , although they 're somewhat disputed about the fiscal drag . I think everybody 's coming to an agreement , Democratic or Republican alike that we have to get a hold of this deficit , $ 1.4 trillion a year . million unemployed caused by the illegal immigrants ? </s>
Well , if we do n't create -- if we do not create , in this country , 200,000 jobs a month , that 's 200,000 new jobs every month have to be created in this country by the private sector in order for us to climb out of this recession , okay ? Most economists agree that that 's the number . We have n't had a 200,000 monthly increase in quite some time . But we do bring in 160 some thousand a month legally , let alone the numbers that come across the border and fly in this country and stay , which is a significant number . </s>
It 's not just people coming across the border who are illegal aliens in the country . And so they 're part of the problem . </s>
Where do those jobs go ? Okay . I 'm sorry . </s>
I ca n't have you debating with him . But thank you for your question . And we 're going to take a short break and come back with more of your questions . Welcome back . Our motion is “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses.” </s>
This is a debate from “Intelligence Squared U.S.” We are in the question-and- answer section of the debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have two teams of two sides each arguing this motion , “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses.” And now to some more questions . There 's a woman , if you did that -- talk about potential changes to our existing immigration policy , and I wonder if the against side would also talk about what changes you would make , because I think most people would agree that what we have now does n't work tremendously well . </s>
So the key and the most important change -- </s>
Tamar Jacoby . -- is that we give the workers who we 're going to need in the future a way to come legally . Right now , we do n't need that many foreign workers . We need some in agriculture . And at the high end , we do n't need that many . </s>
But in the future when the economy picks up , and Americans go back to their better jobs and their year-round jobs , and they start to go to restaurants , and they start to go to hotels , and we start to build houses again , we 're going to need immigrant workers . And on that day , I say we want to have them come legally as opposed to illegally . If our economy needs them , have them come legally . I also think we need enforcement . </s>
Our opponents are n't wrong about enforcement . </s>
We do need better enforcement on the border and better enforcement in the workplace to make sure -- we need to create legal channels and enforce against the people who are coming illegally . And we need some answer for the 11 million people who are already here and are not going home no matter how miserable we make them with police stops and other things . </s>
You know , maybe some of them will go home -- </s>
But does n't your argument for the enforcement that would keep the numbers down fight your argument that we need the workers and the -- No , no . You need -- the best answer for illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works . </s>
If people are coming to work here , give them a legal way to come and then stop the illegals coming -- Julián Castro : I would also just add really , very quickly , that this idea that everybody agrees that they broke the law . But there are a million different ways that people break the law every single day of the year . And for instance , if you break the law , and you 're speeding , you mentioned speeding earlier , or you 're breaking the law because you do n't have insurance , and you 're driving , or you 're breaking the law because , for some other reason , one of the models that 's out there is something called deferred adjudication . </s>
So as a lawyer you know , Kris , that basically under deferred adjudication , you still get punished either by paying a fine or doing community service . And as long as you do n't commit another crime within a certain amount of time , you 're able , basically , to wipe that off your record and get on with your life . That happens millions and millions of times . </s>
I would imagine in just about every state in the United States . </s>
Something like an amnesty . Julián Castro : It 's not like the model is not there already . </s>
Kris , it is . Kris Kobach . Amnesty is a horrible idea for four quick -- for four reasons . </s>
Number one , you 're going to see that the fiscal impact is going to triple . The 89.3 -- $ 89.1 billion a year that we 're losing fiscally is going to become 2.6 trillion over 10 years . That was according to the Robert Rector study in 2007 . </s>
The reason is simple . Right now , illegal aliens get food stamps , Medicaid , free school lunches , K through 12 education . </s>
If they become legalized , then they get the big ones . </s>
Then they get Medicare and Social Security . </s>
And the price goes way , way up . Talk about the golden door . Number two , it wo n't just be 11.3 million . The last time we had a major amnesty in 1986 , according to the INS 's own records , 398,000 illegal aliens quickly came across the border to falsely claim that they were already here and grabbed the amnesty . </s>
Number three , we 've been hearing about the terrorists . </s>
We mentioned that earlier about the terrorists coming in . The notion that we are going to suddenly sift through this population and know who the terrorists are and who they are n't is demonstrably false . </s>
Mahmud Abouhalima who was one of the ring leaders in the ’93 attack on the World Trade Center here in this city was given amnesty in the 1986 amnesty . And number four , it 's a slap in the face to the people -- Everybody who paid the price -- </s>
-- who did it the right way . And did it the right way . </s>
No one 's talking about amnesty . We 're talking about asking people to make restitution and get right with the law . Nobody 's talking about amnesty . A slap on the wrist , and then you get to stay . </s>
That 's called amnesty . Julián Castro : No . I would say , Kris , that that that 's an open question . </s>
In other words , how much are you going to punish , just bluntly , how can you punish them for having broken the law ? I think that there is room to maneuver among reasonable people there . </s>
Third row , beige sweater . Wait for the mic , okay ? </s>
I 'm really concerned about the argument , the fiscal argument that this group over here is making in regards to the fiscal impact . When you support the attrition through enforcement strategy , that strategy has detained thousands of -- hundreds of thousands of people over -- almost 400,000 people were deported last year . </s>
There is about 30,000 immigrants detained in facilities all across our country that is costing the American people , including immigrants , because they are contributing to the economy and to taxes , $ 1.7 billion . There 's 30,000 -- You 're saying there 's a cost to enforcement . </s>
There 's a cost . And that 's just the detention cost . Okay . Let 's let -- </s>
So that has -- and that is also , you know , in terms of our values of being here in the United States , what does that speak to to the people who are here , that we -- you know , do we want to be viewed as a country that is detaining 30,000 people in detention and deporting almost 400,000 people ? I do n't think that that 's the values that the United States is really portraying across the country . </s>
Kris Kobach . As a lawyer who has worked in this area , you 're right . It 's about 30,000 who are detained . Those are people in deportation proceedings . We call them removal proceedings . </s>
But that 's a small percentage of the total number of people who are being removed from the country at any given time . And the reason that 30,000 is actually too low is that if you do not detain an alien while he is in removal proceedings , and then the judge says , at the end of the immigration removal hearing , `` You are deported , '' hands him a removal letter , 93 percent will abscond . They will leave . They will disobey the letter . </s>
And it 's known among the immigration attorneys as a run letter . And so if you do n't detain , they do n't go . And if we believe that our courts have any meaning , and are nothing more than just a laughing stock , we have got to try to detain the ones that present the highest risk of leaving -- </s>
But the point is the whole system is broken . Of people in detention , a lot of these people in detention do n't even have an attorney , do n't have any due process . </s>
And that needs to be addressed . And do we want -- Okay . Every immigration hearing has a right to an attorney . </s>
-- as the American public , to be viewed as -- Kris , Kris , I do n't want you debating with the audience . But your passion has been registered and respected . </s>
Sir , on the same aisle to your left . </s>
Let the mic go back down . </s>
Gentleman in the purple tie . Oh , it 's coming the other way . </s>
And if you could stand up , sir . Thanks . The con side has both been saying there’s not enough legal immigration . But it 's been briefly mentioned we do accept 1 million permanent legal immigrants each year and about -- and nearly a million temporary workers , and that number has not gone down since the recession . </s>
Ms. Jacoby says that you support -- we do n't need it now . </s>
So would you support a moratorium until the jobs go back up ? </s>
And also how many people , 15 million people apply for the diversity lottery alone . </s>
So how many do you want in the country before you -- So the point is that the market -- Tamar Jacoby . -- works really well to attract people -- when times are good , the market attracts people . And when times are bad , people get the signal all the way to their villages in Mexico , and they do n't come . </s>
Since the downturn , half as many people have been coming every year from Mexico , half . People hear that there are no jobs , and so they do n't come . They 're not coming for welfare . They 're not coming for unemployment . </s>
They do n't get those things . They 're coming to work . And that 's -- we should be happy about that . That 's attrition by bad economy , though . Exactly . </s>
We should be happy that the market sends the signals . And the system that -- </s>
Tom Tancredo . -- I think we should have is a way for when the market is good and attracting people , those people who are coming to work should be able to come legally . I do n't think we need people working here and being -- Tom Tancredo . Tamar apparently agrees that jobs are the attraction . </s>
Without the jobs , they do n't come . Without the jobs , they go back . Therefore , it 's an enforcement issue . </s>
Something that 's called -- right now , it 's a program that 's voluntary . It should be mandatory . </s>
It 's called E- Verify , just a requirement that every employer use a process that -- I 'm for E-Verify . -- actually verifies whether the person is -- has got a good social security number . Now , can it be -- can there be problems ? </s>
Of course . </s>
You can steal the social security . </s>
But it 's a great use of a tool that 's out there that would not cost a great deal of money , it 's an easy process , and it would have the effect if Tamara 's right that people wo n't come if they hear there 's no jobs , it would have the effect I think also of saying I believe if there are no jobs -- Julián Castro . -- so many people left , by the way -- Julián Castro . </s>
-- so many people left in Arizona -- Julián Castro : Let me just say that I agree that jobs are what drive folks over here . I disagree with the idea that if those jobs are n't there at a given time that they 're necessarily just going to go back . You know , the point was made very early that these folks -- let 's say that you 've had a job for 12 years , 13 years , and you 've had -- and you 're married now and you have children who are United States citizens , you know , for the children the United States is home . Mexico or wherever they 're from is not home . </s>
And in many ways , Mexico is n't even the place that feels like home anymore . So it 's a much more complicated issue than just to say if you press this button then this is going to happen . That 's not reality . That 's not . </s>
Okay , we have time for one more question that I want to get in , sir , at the far edge , if you could stand up . </s>
Hi , this question’s for the pro side , what would you tell to the people like the teenagers , the low skilled American worker , people with the minority communities , who are trying to get jobs , but yet some of those jobs been taken by illegal immigrants and those are those jobs they could have probably had ? So I work with seasonal employers . I just did a survey of a couple hundred of -- actually probably up to 500 seasonal employers . These are like resorts in remote places and fruit picking and seasonal work . </s>
And I asked them , are more Americans showing up now in the downturn to apply for these jobs ? And what they tell me is in the past , no , Americans showed up to work in a seasonal job but , yes , this year a little uptick in the numbers of Americans showing up , but then when they learn that it 's only a seasonal job and that it 's physically -- that it 's outside and that it 's not going to lead to anything , that they 're going to have to leave at the end , people are not taking those jobs , staying for maybe a few weeks and then leaving . The Americans are not competing with immigrants . They 're mostly doing jobs that Americans do not -- are not wanting to do . </s>
They -- Kris Kobach . Let 's not talk about one anecdote , let 's talk about data in whole industries . There is no industry that expresses this more than the meatpacking industry . </s>
The meatpacking industry 30 years ago was almost entirely worked by U.S. citizens , the Green Bay Packers , a bunch of , you know , whole cities built on meatpacking . But today , the meatpacking industry is about half and half , about half illegal aliens , half U.S. citizens . We see exactly what happens when the INS , now ICE goes and shuts down a meatpacking company because -- or does a raid , and suddenly 300 employees have gone out . </s>
There was a raid in Georgia a few years ago , and they had two to 300 employees were arrested . What happened ? </s>
Wages went up . They had to go up . They went from $ 6.75 an hour , and then they went up to $ 7.75 an hour , and what happened was U.S. citizens and legal aliens started taking the jobs once the wages got high enough . </s>
But you 're leaving out the turnover also went up . That’s exactly what has to happen . The turnover went through the roof because people do the jobs for a little while and then they don’t want to do them anymore . </s>
Twenty years ago , the average wage in meatpacking was about $ 12 an hour . And that 's -- Now it’s about eight dollars an hour , that’s not in real dollars that’s in absolute dollars . </s>
There’s no other industry -- </s>
I have to separate the you because that concludes round two of our debate . Oh , no . And here’s where we are , we 're about to hear brief opening statements -- we 're about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn . They will be two minutes each , and remember how you voted before the debate because immediately after their closing statements we’re going to ask you to vote again and the team that has changed the most minds according to your votes will be picked -- declared our winner . So on to round three closing statements by each debater in turn . </s>
Our motion is `` Don’t give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses , '' and here to argue against the motion , against the don’t , Julián Castro , Mayor of San Antonio , Texas , the seventh largest city in the United States . Julián Castro : All right , well thank you very much for giving us this audience this evening . </s>
You 've heard arguments on both sides tonight . But I want you to think about at the end of the day what the United States of America stands for , what it stood for from its founding and what it stands for in this year 2011 . </s>
The United States has always stood for opening up the doors of opportunity to folks around the world . And that means that through the years there have been many folks who came here legally and there have also been many folks who came here illegally . It is undisputed that folks who are both legal and illegal are making an enormous economic contribution to the United States . In fact , depending on the studies whether it’s a one percent difference or a three percent difference , they are contributing in taxes , in creating jobs for others , in economic impact in founding companies , and our folks on the other side are trying to have it both ways , to say that , yes , throughout history we’ve become the number one economy in the world because of all of these immigrants . </s>
And many of them were illegal during that time as well . But something has changed . We have to change the entire identify of the country . I don’t believe that that’s true . </s>
I believe that the evidence bears out that , yes , we can strengthen our enforcement , but we need to deal with the 11 million folks who are here illegally , punish them for the fact that they broke the law , and then give them a chance at the back , at the end of the line , to become citizens eventually , and to deal with the fact that the American economy needs these influx of workers . In 2012 , we’ll have the oldest average age for an American worker in our history , 41.6 years . We have a declining workforce that must be replenished by immigrants to the United States . And there’s no better place to deliver that message than New York City , the city of immigrants that has become the greatest city in the world . </s>
Thank you , Julián Castro . </s>
Your time is up . Our motion is `` Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . '' And here to argue for the motion , for the “don’t , ” Tom Tancredo , a former Congressman from Colorado . </s>
I mentioned that I first got into this whole thing because of the intellectual stimulation I believe that it provides . </s>
And I think tonight’s a good example , that it certainly does that . It is a fascinating discussion , and I sincerely respect the opinions of the people on the other side of this . I would say that there is , for America , I think all of us at this table want exactly what has been expressed , Julián , by you , certainly an opportunity for people who come here , an opportunity to do great things . </s>
I also want for people who live here , for people who are on the lowest rung of the economic ladder in this country to also have an opportunity , to have the ability to actually get a job , progress through the system , and especially the ones -- I’m talking about the ones that have done it the right way . Nothing hurts -- there’s no group of people in the United States that’s more negatively impacted by massive immigration , both legal and illegal , of low-skilled , low-wage people , than the people who are here legally , who are low-skilled , low-wage people . They are our citizens . Why is it so hard for us to think about them , to think about their needs ? For the most part , you know , when we’re talking about the immigration process and these people , they came the right way . </s>
And , by the way , this has nothing to do with race , ethnicity , absolutely nothing . I assure you that if Italy was on our southern border , had as much poverty , as much population , we would have just as many problems with Italians coming across that border illegally . It’s got nothing to do with ethnicity , nothing . Although it’s always tried to be - - people try to cast it in that light because they want to move the discussion away from the real problem and to this bogeyman of racism . Is it out there ? </s>
Of course . But I’ll tell you what , it does not motivate me . All I want is for this country to achieve its goals . </s>
I want it to be the place , yeah , that , still , everybody wants to come because we have a vibrant economy in which most of the people here are doing well , in fact , all of the people are doing well , and this is -- Tom Tancredo , your time’s up . Thank you . Okay . Our motion is `` Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses . '' </s>
And here to argue against the motion , Tamar Jacoby , who is president and CEO of Immigration Works USA . Well , in conclusion , I would just like to sharpen the choice here a little bit . </s>
I think what you’ve heard is we all agree that the immigration system we have isn’t working , but we differ in a very sharp way about what the solution is . Our opponents say that the solution has one dimension . It’s enforcement and enforcement only . </s>
We say that the solution has several dimensions . Yes , it’s enforcement . </s>
Yes , it’s security . </s>
But it’s also a legal immigration system that works . The best antidote to illegal immigration is a legal immigration system that works . And I urge -- and the other place we disagree is we disagree over whether immigration and , really , the economy in America and American life is a zero-sum game or not . Our opponents are saying they have the vision of America that leaves no room for people with energy and grit and entrepreneurialism who want to come here and make better lives for their families , but also make America a better place . </s>
They have no room for -- their vision leaves no room for hope and for an expansive America . Their vision is that there’s never enough of anything and that’s it’s a zero-sum game . And our point is that that’s just not true in America . Yes , we’re in a hard time now , but that hard time is not going to last forever . Immigrants do n't take jobs . </s>
They create them . Immigrants do n't threaten us . They bring talent and vitality . American culture and society have n't lost their appeal . Immigrants are as drawn to them as ever , and immigrants are still integrating or assimilating every bit as fast as they did in the past . </s>
So I think the notion is exactly wrong . Shutting the gates now would be a disastrous policy . We need immigrants to create jobs and grow . And that need 's only going to get stronger as the economy recovers . </s>
Just saying no is n't an answer . It 's a fantasy , and it 's an un- American fantasy at that . Thank you , Tamar Jacoby . Our motion is “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses.” And here to argue for the motion , Kris Kobach , Secretary of State of Kansas and co-author of Arizona 's S.B . 1070 , the legal immigration law . </s>
I just want to address a couple of loose ends quickly . Julián just mentioned this notion that if we had an amnesty , it would be just fine . It 'd be fair because the illegal aliens would go to the end of the line . Legally speaking , that 's impossible . </s>
When you have an amnesty , you immediately give lawful status to the people who are here . They have been automatically given what four to five million people are waiting for who are trying to do it the right way . There is no such thing as the end of the line . </s>
As soon as you grant an amnesty , the person is automatically at the front of the line . </s>
And then we heard from them earlier that we should n't have a policy that fluctuates , encourages immigration some years , it discourages it depending on the needs of the U.S. economy . It should be pretty much wide open all the time . No . That 's exactly what we want . </s>
We want immigration policy that is legal and that meets the interests of the United States because we owe our highest duty to our own citizens . And finally , we hear about this point again and again , and they 're encouraging this myth of belief that there are jobs Americans wo n't do . And we have to bring them in for the lower end jobs because Americans wo n't do those jobs . Now , remember , I told you the statistics . </s>
Americans are doing those jobs . </s>
But there 's a cultural problem with that argument too . It 's encouraging high school kids today , many of whom have never pulled on the starter cord of a Briggs and Stratton lawnmower engine , to believe that certain jobs are beneath them . I would say that is un-American . Our country is built on manual labor , everybody going through a period in their life when they worked a job like that , and then they moved on . Well , this attitude of , let the immigrants do those jobs is a pernicious attitude in our society . </s>
And so I 'll conclude -- -- conclude with this . Do n't give us your tired and your poor because our tired and our poor American citizens , who are disproportionately minority and who are out of work need those jobs . They need also the welfare state to survive . And those things are not going to happen if you have a massive amnesty or you have unbridled illegal immigration continuing , which an amnesty would further . </s>
So let 's look after our own tired and our own poor and then look at immigration in terms of what services our national interests . </s>
Thank you , Kris Kobach . And that concludes our closing statements . And now it 's time to learn which side you feel argued best . We 're asking you to go again to the key pads to the right of your seat and to register your vote . We will get the readout almost immediately . </s>
So our motion is “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses.” </s>
And if you agree with this motion , if you agree with do n't give us , push number one . If you disagree , push number two . And if you are -- remain undecided or became undecided , push number three . </s>
And it 'll lock in . So we 're done with the excitement of the evening . </s>
And I just want to say that in an issue that was as contentious as this , I so respected how these two teams actually respected the argument and respected each other 's arguments enough to hear them , and I want to congratulate them all . And I personally stood to learn some things from the questioners , including yours , ma'am , which I rejected . Turned out to be a great question . And as far as your question and the argument that you want to have with Kris Kobach , he 'll be right there afterwards , and he 'll be waiting for you . But thank you , all of you for all of your questions . </s>
They really helped the process a great deal . So this spring , our theme has been “America 's house divided.” </s>
And tonight 's debate was the last part of this spring season of our regularly scheduled debates . But we now are happy to announce that we 're having a special sixth debate that 's going to take place next month . We 're just putting it together now . </s>
And it 's in partnership with the Film Society of Lincoln Center and in conjunction with the opening of the documentary called “Page One : A Year Inside the New York Times.” And the motion that we 're going to be debating is this : “The First Amendment does not entitle the press to print state secrets.” That debate’s going to be taking place here at the Skirball Center on Wednesday , June 8th . </s>
And we 're going to be announcing who our lineup of debaters is quite shortly . Tickets are available , though , already at the Skirball box office and also through our Web site . </s>
And do n't forget , you can follow “Intelligence Squared U.S.” on Twitter . You can see if any of you Tweeted tonight , let 's see what you had to say . </s>

So take a look at our homepage , and make sure to put those dates in your calendar . All of our debates -- we said this before , and you 've been very , very gracious in doing the radio bits . </s>
And if you listen to the NPR broadcast , you can hear your own applause . That will be you , especially you out there with that distinctive clap . They will be heard on NPR stations across the country . And you can watch the debate on Bloomberg Television networks starting next Monday . </s>
So visit bloomberg.com for your local channel . All right . So it 's all -- we 've been given the results . </s>
Remember , the team that changes the most minds is declared our victor . Our motion is “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses.” Before the debate , 16 percent of you were for the motion , 54 percent were against , and 30 percent undecided . </s>
After the debate , 35 percent are for the motion . </s>
That 's up 19 percent . 52 percent are against . That 's down 2 percent . </s>
13 percent are undecided . That means the team arguing for the motion carried the day . “Do n't give us your tired , your poor , your huddled masses” has been carried . </s>
Our congratulations to that side . </s>
Thanks from me , John Donvan and “Intelligence Squared U.S.” </s>
Thank you . Thank you very much , Bob . </s>
So I’d like to welcome you all to the eighth debate of the second Intelligence Squared series . The resolution being debated tonight , “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary.” Let me give you a brief rundown of the evening . It’s a really interesting format , members of each team will alternate in presenting their side of the argument , those presentations will be limited to seven minutes . </s>
When opening arguments are complete I’ll open up the floor to brief questions from the audience , and after the Q-and-A each debater will make a final two-minute summation . Finally , you’ll get to vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad attached to your armrest , and I will announce your decision on which side carried the day . But , let’s start with a pre-debate vote . Pick up the keypad attached to the armrest on your left… Looks like this . </s>
Close the buckle and secure it firmly around your waist when— no . For audience members sitting alongside the aisle on my right , your keypad is attached to the armrest on your right side next to your neighbors . Again , tonight’s resolution is , “Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary.” After my prompt , please press “1” to vote for the motion , “2” to vote against the motion , or “3” if you’re undecided . </s>
Vote now . Everybody done ? </s>
I will reveal the results of your vote later this evening , and now I’ll introduce the panel . Please hold your applause until all six are introduced . For the motion…retired Air Force lieutenant-colonel and military analyst for NBC News , Rick Francona . </s>
The John M. Olin Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and a contributing editor to City Journal , Heather Mac Donald . </s>
And a partner at Baker & Hostetler LLP and Visting Fellow at the Nixon Center who’s served in the Reagan and George H.W . Bush administrations , David Rivkin . Against the motion . 25-year veteran of the FBI and president of the global risk and crisis management firm Clayton Consultants , Jack Cloonan . </s>
Former Judge Advocate General of the Navy , President and Dean of the Franklin Pierce Law Center , retired rear admiral John Hutson . And professor of political science and Chair of the Political Science Department at Reed College , Darius Rejali . Okay . </s>
And now we’ll start the debate—for the motion , Heather Mac Donald . Thank you very much . I will argue that stress interrogation techniques are both necessary for getting information from suspected terrorists after 9-11 , and effective in doing so . </s>
I will base my arguments on the actual experience of interrogators in Afghanistan and elsewhere . </s>
This is not a debate about torture . The stress methods that interrogators developed , such as short periods of sleep deprivation and isolation , were light years from torture . And to call them such , degrades the moral opprobrium that rightly attaches to the term . As my colleagues will demonstrate , the use of stress techniques on terrorists is lawful . </s>
The burden therefore falls on our opponents , to explain why legal and essential methods to gain critical information about future terrorist attacks should be off-limits . </s>
It didn’t take long for interrogators working in Afghanistan , to realize that the traditional army interrogation techniques were nearly useless against the Al Qaeda operatives and Taliban fighters whom the military was picking up in the fall of 2001 . </s>
Those traditional techniques , a set of 16 psychological gambits assembled during the Cold War , were designed to help young Americans , soldiers , debrief Soviet prisoners of war on the battlefield . The 16 gambits have been crafted for use against conventional soldiers , lowly grunts , conscripted into a state army , who are often only too glad to be taken off the battlefield and out of the war . </s>
Army lore held that 95 percent of lawful prisoners of war would divulge information upon direct questioning . </s>
In Afghanistan , this ratio was reversed . Virtually none of the terror detainees was giving up information . Tried-and-true approaches , like appealing to a prisoner’s love of family , often had little purchase . If an interrogator offered a jihadist prisoner contact with his wife or children , in exchange for information , the jihadist might respond , quote , “I’ve divorced this life . I don’t care about my family , ” end quote . </s>
Unlike lawful prisoners of war , the terror detainees were never off the battlefield . They continued their vicious attacks against their captors at every opportunity while in detention . Some of the detainees had been trained in resistance techniques , and knew the limits of American interrogation rules . </s>
Others quickly learned what those limits were . So the interrogators began cautiously experimenting with stress techniques , such as marathon questioning sessions or aggressive behavior , to put a detainee on edge . </s>
The purpose of such methods was to recreate the shock of capture , that vulnerable mental state immediately following capture , when a prisoner is most frightened , uncertain , and likely to give up information . Uncertainty is an interrogator’s most powerful ally . </s>
It can lead the detainee to believe that the interrogator is in total control , and holds the key to his future . An interrogator facing a resistant Taliban explosives-maker , for example , might angrily hoist the prisoner up by his collar , and storm out of the interrogation booth . </s>
The detainee had previously understood that American interrogators couldn’t so much as lay a finger on them . Suddenly , he doesn’t know what the interrogator’s limits are . That frightening uncertainty can change his calculations about whether to cooperate . According to interrogators in—in Afghanistan and Guantanamo , stress worked . </s>
The harsher the methods that the questioners used , the sooner they got good information . Eventually , the military codified a set of stress techniques for use in Guantanamo and Iraq . These included keeping a detainee awake at night , putting him on cold Army rations instead of hot meals , isolation , environmental manipulation , and impersonating a foreign agent . All were hedged round with numerous bureaucratic and medical safeguards . None of the stress techniques that the military approved for use on terror detainees had anything to do otherwise with Abu Ghraib . </s>
Abu Ghraib was the result of the unconscionable and culpable breakdown of military discipline , throughout the detention camp . Soldiers sprayed graffiti on the walls , engaged in public sexual misbehaver , and operated bootlegging and prostitution rings . </s>
Elliot Spitzer is not known to have used any of them . The guards’ sadistic and sexualized treatment of prisoners was an extension of the chaos they were already wallowing in . It had nothing to do with interrogation . Had the rules for prisoner treatment and questioning been followed at Abu Ghraib , the abuse couldn’t have happened . In conclusion , the stress interrogation techniques that interrogators developed to break detainees’ resistance , were necessary , effective , and lawful . </s>
They were far from torture . </s>
In certain instances as—as Bob said , they resembled what army recruits and professionals go through as part of their training . </s>
As a reality check , here’s the Senate’s definition of torture . It is that barbaric cruelty which lies at the top of the pyramid of human rights misconduct—such as sustained systematic beating , application of electric currents to sensitive parts of the body , and tying up or hanging in positions that cause extreme pain . One . It would be reckless to ignore the experience of interrogators on the ground , who came up against detainee resistance that was potentially catastrophic in consequence . </s>
Intelligence about terror planning is our only sure defense against attack . </s>
Nothing else matters . </s>
Interrogators facing the urgent need to get life-saving information from terrorists with likely knowledge of future plots , should be allowed to use stress when the questioning techniques designed for lawful prisoners of war are not working . Thank you . </s>
Against the motion , John Hutson . Thank you . Gee , it all sounds so…sweet and benign . </s>
Uh…ask ‘em a few questions , have ‘em stand up for a while , you know…make them take their shirt off , get ‘em a little cold maybe . </s>
300-pound Iraqi general… stuffed in—head-first—into a sleeping bag , bound up with electrical wires , sat on by a Army warrant officer… Hand put over his face every time he screamed out for Allah… Released , put back in , died . Dead . That was a stress position . </s>
Guy was prosecuted , got six months for some orders violations , but , basically , was released because it was an authorized stress position . Taxi driver Dilawar , hung from the ceiling , by his wrists . Five days after he’s—not captured , but turned over , turned over , to American forces in exchange for a ransom , beaten to a point where , according to the autopsy , by an Army doctor , his legs are pulpified . Dead . By the DOD’s own count , approximately 40 people have been killed in the hands of the United States , in detention , as homicides . </s>
So let’s not kid ourselves that this is some sort of benign search for the truth . Torture was never intended to be that . </s>
Torture was intended originally , to be an effort to get false confessions . You’re a heretic , you’re a traitor to the king , you’re a witch . We’ve given a bad name to torture . </s>
We’ve misapplied torture , we’re trying to use it to find the truth , for Pete’s sake . My experience has been , in doing these kinds of things and these—with these kinds of groups , that there are a number of people who have a number of different points of view about it . </s>
Some of you are moved by history , tradition…some of you are moved by the morality of it , the moral imperative . </s>
Some of you are moved by diplomacy . Some of you are simply moved by the practicality of it . Are there better methods , or is this the best method . What I want to do is address six aspects of torture , or , benign interrogation , whatever you want to call it , stuffing people in sleeping bags head first and binding them up , and then give each of you the opportunity to pick the one that you kind of think works , and then my colleagues will hone in on some of them . First one is that it inflames , enrages the enemy , and causes them not to surrender . </s>
There’s a reason the Nazis surrendered to the Americans on the Eastern front and not to the Russians . In the first Iraq war , tens of thousands of Iraqis surrendered to us because they knew that they would be treated decently . My friends , they’re not surrendering to us anymore . It endangers our own troops . We’re the ones on the front lines . </s>
It’s the—it’s US troops at the pointy end of the spear , forward-deployed in more locations on more occasions in greater numbers than all the other forces of this world combined . There is a reason that the United States wanted there to be a Geneva Convention , it wasn’t to protect them from us , it was to protect us from them . </s>
And we’ve lost that . John McCain said , that he believes he was treated incrementally better because the Vietnamese knew—North Vietnam knew—that we were abiding by the Geneva Conventions in spite of the fact we didn’t have to . According to the arguments , based on the same rationale that the administration uses now . It interferes with our ability to build coalitions , in the future wars are gon na be fought by coalition forces . The United States should not and can not go alone . </s>
We were just put on the list of human-rights violators by Canada . </s>
We got them to take us off , but the point is…Canada , the Aussies , the Brits , aren’t going to want to fight with us if they can’t expect us to comply with the Geneva Conventions , and we’re going to be out there at the pointy end of the spear , all by our lone . </s>
It causes Americans to become torturers . It’s one thing for us to send our good men and women into battle and ask them to give that last full measure of devotion . It’s another thing to send them into battle and ask them to become torturers and come home that way . Fifthly , it’s simply not the most effective method . </s>
People say , “Does torture work ? ” Torture- , does torture work is n't the right question . The question is , is there another more effective way to do it . Let me quote to you from , say , General Petraeus , who one would think would know something about it . Some may argue that we would be more effective if we sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain information from the enemy . </s>
They would be wrong . Beyond the basic fact that such actions are illegal , tort history shows that they are frequently neither useful nor necessary . One . The fight depends on securing the pop- , boy , that went fast . I just… </s>
…got into this . The fight depends on securing the populations , which must understand that we , not our enemies , occupy the high moral ground . And then finally , and I’d like to return to this , because I think it’s , if I get another chance , I think it’s the most important issue . This is an asymmetric war . </s>
In an asymmetric war you want to , you want to pit your greatest strength against the enemy’s greatest weakness . Fortunately , in this war , that works for us , if we will do it . Because our greatest strength is our ideas and our ideals . The enemy is completely bereft of ideas and our- , and ideals . </s>
Thomas Paine said in 1776 , “The cause of America is the cause of all mankind.” Several hundred years later , that great geopolitical commentator Bono said America is n't just a country , it’s an idea . Ok , thank you . For the motion , David Rivkin . The critics invariably portray , as you just heard now , waterboarding and other stress techniques as torture . </s>
I would stipulate easily and readily that waterboarding and other stress techniques is a fairly unpleasant practice . It offends our 21st century sensibilities . </s>
It’s something that’s difficult to talk about . But I also believe we’re at war with an implacable and ruthless foe that thinks nothing about killing civilians by the thousands and is seeking to kill millions more . I do n't think anybody would disagree about obtaining intelligence is vital in this war . </s>
And we can debate , theoretically , the proposition that other techniques work , but it’s a matter of fact . There are instances where hardened anti-operatives did not prove susceptible to these kinder , gentler techniques , and yet provided intelligence when they were subjected to stressful interrogation techniques . But my overarching message to you is that this is a policy debate . </s>
It should be a policy debate , which is why asking the question that has been posed today is useful . The obsession of legalities is not helpful . The legal definition of torture is necessarily vague . The torture defined in the ’94 statute which was passed to implement obligations under an anti-torture convention , as quote , “Intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering , both physical and mental.” Much of the legal debate about torture boils down to the question of how severe is severe . </s>
As far as the physical pain and suffering is concerned , it’s almost certainly the case that some forms of waterboarding have been practiced by the CIA on only three occasions that we know of , with three different high-value detainees , rise to the level of torture . And some probably , particularly those that did not involve full inundation of the subject do not . </s>
The reason for this is because the physical discomfort suffered by the subject of- , being subjected to this technique while was not severe enough . As far as the mental severe pain and suffering is concerned , it bears emphasizing that Congress deliberately adopted a narrow definition of the term “severe” to encompass only , and I quote , “prolonged mental harm caused by or resulting from the threat of imminent death or mind altering substances.” In my view waterboarding and other techniques practiced by the CIA do not fit this definition for at least two reasons . </s>
First of all , the practice of waterboarding used by the CIA was extremely short , sixty to ninety seconds , which certainly suggests even to our lawyer that it’s not protracted . Significant to the question of what is , what constitutes protracted was further debated by Congress in 2005 and 2006 in the context of two key pieces of legislation when Congress handled- , and once again , the answer was that there has to be some duration , some timeline for something to be considered protracted . Second , the high-value terrorist being interrogated are perfectly aware that they’re not in any danger of death , that the CIA was after information , their lives were not in danger . When Congress passed in the Detainee Treatment Act something called “shocks the conscience standard” , which makes it even harder to argue that these techniques are always , inherently , and absolutely torture , because the shock , shocks the conscience standard , by definition -- and it’s something that borrows from American case law -- it is inherently a context- specific standard . It is not something that you would be able to answer in the abstract . </s>
It’s also worthy to point out that while the original Justice Department so-called “torture memo” was perhaps overly broad in its definition of what level of pain and suffering constitutes torture , lots of legal council came up with some more nuanced analysis . Significantly , ladies and gentlemen , this analysis was developed by lawyers , at least some of whom where critical of the administration’s policy . </s>
Indeed , as reported in the media , including by Stuart Taylor of the National Journal , the lead author of the subsequent memo by OLC on this issue was none other than senior DOJ official Daniel Levin , who himself had been subjected to waterboarding as a part of his research . I know that trusting the gallowman is not an argument most of you like these days , but I would certainly be inclined to trust Dan Levin , who by the way was reportedly forced out by Alberto Gonzales for not being sufficiently solicitous of the White House positions on various other issues . Now , presented with this argument , the critics claim , “Well maybe it’s not torture , but maybe it’s cruel inhuman degrading treatment” , which is another set of legal buzzwords . Yet cruel , inhuman and degrading are even more capacious terms than torture . </s>
For some detainees , the mere fact that they’re being questioned by a Jew or a woman is an intolerable humiliation . Are we supposed to countenance and approve this kind of racist sentiment ? Meanwhile , it’s also the case that there has to be some reasonable definition of what is cruel , inhuman and degrading , because I would submit to you that there is a degree of humiliation , cruelty , and degradation in any kind of custodial interrogation . </s>
There’s yelling , there’s screaming . Threats are being made against a person or his loved ones . Andy Fastow of Enron fame was told by his interrogators that his wife would be imprisoned for a long time , and I would submit to you that it was probably a cruel treatment . </s>
So there has to be some parameters of behavior that’s clearly- , is cruel and degrading and humiliating , but yet does not violate the law . My bottom line is this : while the waterboarding debate implicates legal issue , we can not simply abandon the field to the lawyers . </s>
The lawyers have no special right or expertise to deal with those issues . So our duty as a society is to approach these debates seriously , in a mature fashion . To ask what is really consistent with our values . </s>
Incidentally , we’ve talked about mistakes . My good friend John mentioned mistakes . And yes , shoving somebody’s head in a sleeping bag is not a good thing . </s>
But as you may recall , these problems occur in other contexts . When I was at the Justice Department , one of my responsibilities was investigating various bad things that happened in the Bureau of Prisons . And let me assure you ladies and gentlemen , in a situation when there is no blessing for stress techniques , instead in fact -- prisoners in federal and civil and state penitentiaries not being interrogated at all have… One . …fellow prisoners who commit horrible things . </s>
You have sadistic guards who do horrible things . Recently I had a case in Florida… One . …involving mistreatment by the guards of a child in a boot camp , where he was basically smothered and suffocated in the course of trying to set him straight . This is not an easy debate . </s>
We should not focus exclusively on the question of how to deal with enemy combatants . We should ask a broader set of questions of what level of coercion are we prepared to tolerate in our public policy , something that our government is doing . We should not come up with one set of regimen for captured unlawful enemy combatants when we waterboard our own personnel . Then there are things going on other spheres of public life , including as I mentioned , in boot camps that are harsh . </s>
And -- , but the last point is whatever we do , we should be honest and transparent about this debate . We should not use misdirection . We should not talk in terms of , “Well let’s adopt the same standards as an Army field manual.” Because ladies and gentlemen , the Army field manual , by the way , allows the level of “Mutt and Jeff” technique that does not allow the interrogator playing the bad cop to be disrespectful , to be tough on an individual . </s>
So here we have politicians advocating the level of kindness towards the unlawful enemy combatants that exceeds that that’s been adopted with regard to interrogation of criminal suspects . That is not… Thank you . …the good way to deal with this issue . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Thank you . Against the motion , Darius Rejali . All of us on both sides want good counterterrorism policy . Heather , David , John , all of us want to be safe . </s>
They just represent different fears . I’m here to represent the facts , not their fears . I have been working for 30 years on torture , on not- torture , and everything I’m about to say is in that 900-page book in the lobby . Bottom line , good torture is not good counter-terrorism policy . </s>
As the fascist military police said , torture for interrogation is , and I quote , the “clumsiest method , ” and only a , quote , “fool” would use it . And this is from their interrogation manual from Burma in 1943 . </s>
Now I don’t care whether you call it torture , tough stuff , muffin stuff , not torture . The only question really is , as you say , whether it gets the bad guys , and here is where everybody gets into storytelling -- you’ve heard a few . I have one too . A World War II vet came up to me after a lecture and he said , in France , we caught this German soldier and we pulled a knife to his throat and said , where are the other soldiers . And I said , did you get good info ? </s>
And he said yeah , sorta . I said I’m happy for you , I really am . I really am . Because if you had bad info , you’d be dead . </s>
You would be dead . The problem is that everyone who knows that torture or not-torture doesn’t work , is dead . For those for whom it works , they are walking around saying it worked for me , it worked for them , if… This is what we call in social science a biased sample . If you take real data from the best studies , armies using torture who carefully and selectively selected suspects , eighty—8,000 to 20,000 minimum is what you need to get the best-case scenario , and the best-case scenario that they manage to generate out of these cases is 20 to 78 innocent people had to be tortured for each bad guy they got . </s>
20 to 78 innocent people for each bad guy . Now , for every accurate piece of info then you have to torture in the thousands if you’re professional about it— this is not retail business . This is wholesale . So you tell me , does torture work ? I’ll give you the opinion of the professional Gestapo . </s>
In 1942 the Czech resistance assassinated Reinhard Heydrich , Reichsprotector of Czechoslovakia , Hitler wanted results , he didn’t care how , he said these guys don’t listen to anything , and the Gestapo got the three bad guys but to do that they tortured and killed 7,545 individuals , annihilating two villages . They also got 100 resistance members on the side they weren’t looking for but that’s pretty typical results , Battle of Algiers , Vietnam , we can go through them . At this point , enter Heinz von Panwitz , a career policeman and head of the Gestapo’s anti-sabotage unit from Prague , he said don’t be stupid . Depend on public cooperation , build up rapport , put out a reward . </s>
They got over a thousand tips and in fact what broke the case , what broke the case , was when Korda , a member of the Czech resistance betrayed the entire operation . Korda wasn’t tortured , he lived well , he collected a huge reward , in fact he lived long enough to be executed for treason after the war . </s>
The professional Gestapo repeatedly decimated the resistance through public cooperation and informers , in France , Denmark , Poland , Norway , Russia , Austria , Czechoslovakia , even in the concentration camps . The Gestapo turned to torture when they lost seasoned pros like Panwitz during the war . And then they had young men with whips running around and why learn good policing when you’ve got a whip . Huge government funded studies , our government-funded studies , have proven Panwitz was right . If you don’t have public cooperation the chances that a crime will be solved falls to 10 percent . </s>
Pathetic results . The Gestapo knew public cooperation was the best anti-terrorist method . Public cooperation works even when time is short . July 21st , London , seven guys get on buses with ticking bombs . The British police got all of these guys in 10 days , and the ticking bombs . </s>
The big break came in 24 hours when the parents of Mukhtar Said-Ibrahim turned their son over after seeing the security video . </s>
These were loyal British Muslims . Would they have turned their son over if they knew he was gon na be—not- tortured ? The answer is no . Good torture isn’t just a source of bad intel , it destroys the only thing that really works , public cooperation . Good rapport weakens even the strongest bond we know , good rapport…restores the bond between parent and child . </s>
Even when time is short . Using these techniques during World War II , the British managed to catch 290 German spies hiding among 42,000 refugees crossing over from Europe without torturing any of them . I don’t split hairs over what torture is and what is not torture . </s>
If what makes torture moral or not-torture moral , if it saves innocent lives then the truth has to be that torture is immoral . </s>
Because it takes far more innocent lives than it has ever saved , and that’s true for not-torture . </s>
Actually , some not-torture we use is even worse than torture . Take sleep deprivation . We use it all the time . Professional Spanish Inquisitors , professional Spanish Inquisitors , wouldn’t go near it . They knew sleep deprivation has hypnotic effects under repeated questioning , people will generate visions . </s>
Perfect for seeing packs of the devil and Al Qaeda everywhere . That’s why crazy Scottish witch-hunters used it . It was very effective . </s>
But that’s them Protestants , not—a Catholic inquisitor would not go near this , quote , not-torture . They knew it was unreliable , and yet we use it all the time as if it gets magical results , well it is , it’s magical thinking . That’s all it is . </s>
Good torture creates bad intelligence , involves torturing thousands of innocents , while the terrorists run free . </s>
It destroys our soldiers who are forced to put in these positions , we have the studies , and the organizations . </s>
And limited time makes all these effects worse , not better . That’s the data . The professional Gestapo knew this . </s>
The Japanese Kempei Tai knew this . Even occasionally a Spanish Inquisitor figured this one out . One . With great respect , why shouldn’t we not learn from them . Good counter-terrorism policy depends on winning public support and building up human intelligence . </s>
Look . </s>
I used to be on the other side . I grew up in Iran under the Shah . </s>
The Shah’s SAVAK tortured terrorists , and the Shah said I don’t torture , we just have different ways of doing that , we have to be tough on these medieval radical throwbacks . </s>
They’re different . And Khomeini said , medieval throwback , now look who’s talking , the guys who torture . Nothing was a better recruitment tool for Islamic radicalism than not-torture . And so the question is , how many countries in the Middle East do you want to lose ? How many witch-hunters do you want to follow . </s>
There is intelligence out there . It is time , it is really long past time for us to get our act together . Thank you . Before we begin the discussion part of this debate , I have a question for each side . </s>
And Darius , I’ll direct this to you . Oh , thank you . No exceptions . We’ve all heard about the ticking-bomb scenario , a moment is precious ; we need that information right away . </s>
If you agree that there can be exceptions , then where do you draw the line ? </s>
You know…ticking time-bomb scenarios are wonderful stories , it was actually in a wonderful novel from World—from the French Algerian story , it’s a wonderful fantasy novel , never happened . But I will tell you this . My book shows this . </s>
Ticking time scenarios -- if you want to torture under those circumstances , do you know what the best result—when it’s gon na get you the best result ? During peacetime non-emergency situations , when you need it least . It’s— I don’t understand . </s>
In other words , torture doesn’t work in wartime situations when you have a ticking time bomb , you have to do—it’s a volume business at that point . </s>
It is not a retail business . I still don’t understand , if you have the ticking bomb , whether it’s wartime or not , and you know—somebody knows that there is— </s>
Look , there was a ticking time bomb in World War II in England , right ? Those guys who got off the buses , had a ticking time bomb . It was sitting in the bushes in Brighton , outside a jail . The British got it , because they had public cooperation . </s>
And if you want to torture , fine , but you’ll not find that bomb . And now , to this side . David ? Yes . American leadership and our security , I think we can all agree are based at least in part on our alliances . </s>
And if America is seen as a—is seen in its interrogation methods as a renegade , as it has on such issues as say the ABM treaty and the Kyoto accords , won’t that endanger our leadership role , and thus our security , if we lose that moral high ground and that leadership ? Brooke , we certainly pay a high price for it but a couple of things need to be mentioned , first of all unfortunately the critics that promiscuously lump together , the kind of ordinary yelling , spittle-flying , psychological pressure , modest , sleep deprivation , and label it with the T word , are contributing to this problem . The notion that we as a society can not draw nuances , can not draw distinctions between a tough treatment , which my colleague Darius here referred to as non-torture and true torture , is frankly silly because that’s not what we do in ordinary life . </s>
In any other difficult issues . But more important than that , I am not convinced , I’ve heard this argument many times , I’m not convinced , Brooke , that the alleged… price we’re paying for this aspect of our policy , is sort of a but-for problem . There’re so many other things , that unfortunately our friends and allies do not like because they don’t take the threat of radical Islam seriously , they don’t believe in , in serious use of military power , they’re beyond that . But if we took that off the table it would make a difference . </s>
But the thing that makes me really angry is the notion that we are helping the recruitment of jihadis because we’re talking about a culture that countenances , without any problem , blowing up children , torturing American prisoners to death . </s>
See if you tell me…you know , that , we’re people who are not troubled by that , they think it’s okay . But if they ever read about some level of sexual degradation , humiliation being inflicted on somebody by us , that really ticks them off . I will tell you these are the people who are not gon na win their hearts and minds no matter what we try , I find this argument absolutely absurd , and the final point about how our soldiers are treated . Ladies and gentlemen , our soldiers have been tortured in every single war , since the end of World War II . So the notion that somehow there’s this nirvana , tell this to John McCain . </s>
Tell people in Korea when over 50 percent of American POW’s were tortured and starved to death . Look , we have to do the right thing because it’s the right thing . But let’s not pretend that it’s going to impact how our people are going to be…dealt with . </s>
By this enemy . Go ahead , Rick— </s>
I think one of the points you were trying to make is that it will staunch the willingness of our allies to join with us in these coalitions . I think John , you said coalition is the way we’re gon na go in the future . I agree with that , but I don’t think that this aspect is going to pay that big of a role because when you look at the interrogation techniques that our allies use , they’re much tougher than we are . Look at the way the French interrogate , look at the way the British interrogate , I— that they go far beyond our Army Field Manual . </s>
I would also say , in one sense , I take John Hutson’s argument as really a confirmation of what we’re arguing because he’s—you didn’t address stress , you talked about clear abuses of the interrogation rules . There was no license for stuffing somebody in a sleeping bag and suffocating him to death , that was a violation of the rules , not an interrogation pursuant to them— Nobody stopped it . </s>
And people that have killed detainees have rightly been prosecuted . Most of the deaths occurred at point of capture , not in interrogation at that point when you are sort of still at war , and it’s a very ambiguous state , but in any case , out of the tens of thousands of prisoners that have been taken , 40 criminal homicides is…compared to wars in the past is a pretty low rate , but in any case , we are not arguing for torture . My side here is talking about stress interrogation and I would say as David does , it is perfectly valid to distinguish between keeping somebody up late that it—according to the interrogators who’ve written about this and spoken about this , reversing somebody’s sleep schedules does get information , and burning somebody or destroying them and inflicting deliberate severe pain and stress on—and suffering on them . We have to be able to make these distinctions . </s>
And , again , to conflate the murder of detainees which is clearly a violation of the laws of war , with the calibrated use of stress I think , does no service to what we need to be debating in the future in the war on terror . Did you want to say something— Yes , the— —beforehand ? </s>
The—the point is that , in— This is not an existential war . World War II was an existential , Civil War was an existential war , this just happens to be the present war . And , for us to be here in 2008 , and turn these people into supermen , that the Nazis and Imperial Japan were not , is just kidding ourselves . The problem that we face now is that nobody , nobody in the administration has had said stop . </s>
Nobody said , they may be terrorists , they may be evildoers , but they’re human beings , and we will treat them with the dignity and respect that Americans have always treated human beings , instead , we just let it run rampant . In 1950 the armed forces officer said “Wanton killing , torture , cruelty or the working of unusual , unnecessary hardships on enemy prisoners or populations is not justified under any circumstance.” We have backed away from that standard , and we have permitted good American men and women to engage in a kind of interrogation policy , not because we said , go out and torture , because we didn’t . I mean how—I’d like to have a nickel for every time the President’s said , the United States doesn’t torture . We don’t engage in extraordinary rendition . </s>
But the reality of it is , what was going on there , continued on . You know , you look at the pictures at Abu Ghraib , you look at—you listen to the stories of , of what happened at Guantanamo , gloves off , fear down , and it was pretty clear that if it wasn’t the express policy it was the benign policy of the United States to engage in techniques that we had absolutely forbidden . In 1903 we sent an American major to prison for 10 years for waterboarding a Filipino . We prosecuted Japanese for waterboarding , and sent them to prison . John , to say it’s—we’ve let it run rampant is just not true , people that have abused prisoners have been prosecuted criminally . </s>
When Abu Ghraib came out— Some , some have been— </s>
—there has been— —some have been prosecuted— There has been investigation after investigation of that . I would agree , I think Abu Ghraib , there has not been sufficient , responsibility laid on the commanders that let that situation get out of control , I think it needs to go way far up the Pentagon chain of command but it hasn’t , but again , that happened in contravention of the interrogation rules , the interrogation rules , if they had been followed to the letter , they said that every interrogation technique had to be cleared , had to be monitored . What was going on was not interrogation , this was a bunch of deranged , sadistic guards , working in the middle of the night , that were getting their jollies on these prisoners , it had nothing to do with the interrogation rules— </s>
Let , let me— Rick ? You— Rick ? Well—and I think we need to but this Abu Ghraib thing to rest , and you’re absolutely right , this was not the interrogations we’re talking about . </s>
This was a bunch of military policemen running amok , it was a breakdown of—where were their officers , where were the NCO’s , it was a complete breakdown of the chain of command— That is— It was set up by the , by the command in Baghdad and there have been careers ruined for this , General Sanchez is out of the army now . And he’s—he set up an unworkable chain of command , he put the intelligence people in charge of the prison . You don’t do that— </s>
But some of the jollies that have been described here were techniques that were actually used in Vietnam . Somebody told them what to do , it wasn’t a simple improvisation— —we’re having this debate and the public should , I think , understand this . </s>
We’re having this debate as if , and I think Heather articulated this point , tried to make this point , that everybody that came in on the battlefield in Afghanistan , whether they be Taliban or a so-called Arab insurgent , really had a lot of information . Her position is that people were not cooperating . They were not cooperating , and because they had been trained . </s>
When the fact of the matter is they weren’t trained . The fact of the matter was the reason why they weren’t cooperating , was because they didn’t know anything . </s>
By and large , you have to separate the Taliban from the Arab Al Qaeda fighter . They’re two distinct groups . </s>
In point of fact , they don’t get along quite well . So if somebody is not cooperating , it doesn’t mean that they have been trained . The fact of the matter is that a lot of our people on the ground in Bagram , and I’m quite familiar with it , on the military side , had no idea what they were doing . I need— </s>
Had not received any training whatsoever . You , you— </s>
They were in the dark . I’d like to return to this discussion about Abu Ghraib and those prisoners after , but first , we have two more speakers to hear from , for the motion , Rick Francona . Well , we’ll just follow up on some of this , I had several pages of notes here , but Heather and David went through them quite quickly , so— I’ll speak to some of the subjects that we’ve brought up here—all this is great theory . I appreciate what all of the other speakers have brought to this , and most of the time we’re talking theory . </s>
I’d like to inject some reality into this . </s>
I’m going to submit that I’m probably the only one on the stage that’s been waterboarded . I don’t consider it torture , but by no means do I consider it pleasant and it’s not something you sign up to do , you know , for your summer camp . The Air Force did it during our training to show us what it was like , the purpose of it was to show us the treatment that we could expect as potential prisoners of war . And the point was made and I want to underscore this , never in our history have we gone into a conflict and our prisoners been treated right , the Geneva Convention was an attempt to make that happen . I submit that it has failed miserably . </s>
It restricts what we can do , we make sure we treat people right , and we get no reciprocal treatment at all . So it does not work—now . John McCain will tell you that torture doesn’t work , and that he’s against it because of his experiences in North Vietnam . No one can take away the fact that he was brutally treated , brutally tortured , and he has the gravitas to address this issue . </s>
But you have to understand that John McCain was the victim of torture for the infliction of pain . The Vietnamese were great at that . </s>
They could hurt you , they could make you say things that maybe you didn’t want to say . For the most part , our prisoners did very well . They gave up what they thought their interrogators wanted to hear which is the biggest threat you have when you resort to torture . Whoever you’re torturing , the subject , is going to tell you what he thinks you want to hear . Just like a defector , we’ve seen how bad information leads to bad actions , remember Curveball . </s>
The bad information about the Iraqi mobile labs . This is another instance where people tell you things they want to hear . </s>
Someone being tortured will tell you anything , anything , to stop the pain , to stop the treatment . Waterboarding , someone mentioned a figure 60 to 90 seconds . I can tell you that after about 35 seconds I was ready to tell them anything they wanted to hear . </s>
And I knew this was an exercise . You know , and in the back of your mind , your instructors are telling you , project yourself into a situation . Imagine this to be real . I survived by telling myself , I know this is a game . </s>
That they’re going to let me up before I drown . So , there is that reflex , and waterboarding is so powerful , that it will make you say something . </s>
So , in the hands of skilled interrogators , can waterboarding work ? Absolutely , but you have to know what you’re doing . </s>
The North Vietnamese did not know what they were doing . They were great at inflicting pain , lousy at extracting effective , useful intelligence . Now does it work ? Well , you hate to say trust the government . </s>
But we have two government officials that say it worked . That would be the former director of Central Intelligence , George Tenet , and the director of the bin Laden Unit , Alex Station . Dr. Mark Shore , you’ve seen him on television , he’s making the rounds , I think he has a book out . It can be effective if it’s done properly . </s>
The question is , not , can we do it , the question is , should we do it ? And that’s where we have to decide , or is the tough interrogation of these suspects necessary…do we want to go beyond whatever line that is . I can tell you the line that the government is trying to draw , is the Army Field Manual , I worked under the Army Field Manual , it’s pretty restrictive , the new one is even more restrictive , they rewrote it in November of 2006 . </s>
It’s online , type in to Google , “Army Field Manual Interrogation , ” it’s a voluminous document , it’s written in typical Army bureaucratese , there’s probably four pages in it worth reading . So , and those are the ones that tell you the 16 psychological approaches you can use , none of which will be effective against a terrorism suspect because those techniques were written , just as someone said , to break a captured enemy soldier . One probably with no resistance training whatsoever . When we started taking large amounts of prisoners , in Desert Storm , we had thousands , tens of thousands of Iraqi prisoners that we had to interrogate , we had to assess , and determine if they were worth questioning . And once we determined that they were worth questioning , most of the time if you asked them a question , they gave you the answer . </s>
It was very surprising to us , to learn that all these techniques really weren’t necessary because the Iraqis had no training , most of them were happy just to be away from Saddam Hussein . Very powerful tool . The ones that did not want to cooperate with us , usually you found some major or lieutenant-colonel in the Republican Guard that didn’t want to talk to you , and that’s when those techniques became somewhat effective , but there were always ones that would spit at you , because they knew you couldn’t hurt them . </s>
They knew the Americans followed the Geneva Conventions . They knew , that you weren’t gon na hurt them . </s>
You couldn’t touch them . Until some—and I won’t use any personal references here , some lieutenant-colonels I know , would throw them down to the ground , pull out a pistol , put it to their forehead and say , tell me what I need to know , whatever the question was , or I’m gon na blow your brains out . That now will get you thrown out of the Army , without your retirement . Back then it was not common use but it was pretty effective because , it’s real easy in theory to know that the Americans can’t hurt you . But , when the gun is on your forehead , you’re not sure if this is the one American that didn’t get the memo . </s>
So this can be effective . </s>
Now , I think we— One . Sorry— </s>
—we have to be somewhat reticent in applying these forms of interrogation . But I think we would be foolish , absolutely foolish to outlaw them . I think the President was right to veto any bill that limits what the CIA can do . </s>
And this is only limiting the CIA , the neutered Department of Defense is already constrained by the Army Field Manual . </s>
The idea is to extend that to the entire government . I think that’s a mistake , we still have to have this tool in our arsenal because some people in the government who’ve done this for a living , say that it works . George Tenet said it saved lives , I don’t know that to be true , I don’t know it to be not true . But I think we would be very foolish to take an arrow out of the quiver . And I do think this is an existential war . </s>
And I think it is a war that we’re gon na be fighting for a long time . </s>
I think we need to apply every weapon we have . Against the motion , Jack Cloonan . Good evening . </s>
I don’t believe that harsh interrogation techniques actually work . I’m going to explain to you why , and I’m going to explain a little of my background as to why I’ve come to that conclusion . The question before us tonight is actually very , very important and it’s very , very important to you personally . </s>
I’m going to take us down from this sort of nuanced , 30,000-foot view that we’ve had discussed thus far , and I’m gon na take it down to what I like to call the practical level , the operator’s viewpoint , because that’s where I come from . That’s what my job was . </s>
That’s what I was charged to do . I was charged in 1996 , to eliminate bin Laden , Ayman al-Zawahiri and others as a threat to US national security . </s>
And I found myself in the enviable position of having to travel around the world , and find members of Al Qaeda , and gain their cooperation . And I can assure you as I sit here tonight , being very proud of what the end result of that was , that I did not engage in any harsh interrogation techniques . </s>
It didn’t involve sleep deprivation , it didn’t involve threats from dogs . </s>
It didn’t involve hijinks , and all the other stuff that we’ve heard about . We have a deficit , ladies and gentlemen , that we are facing . And that deficit has to be , that we do not have as we sit here tonight , really good human intelligence . </s>
Yes , we spend an awful lot of money . </s>
We can intercept and suck up emails from all around the world . But we don’t really know what we have . We have a very hard time processing what we have . And when you have the opportunity to sit across the table from a real member of Al Qaeda , a person who has raised their right hand and swore bayat , or allegiance to Sheikh bin Laden , it’s your obligation to get information from them , and to ensure that that information is reliable . </s>
I would think even Rick would freely admit , in some of his writings he has stated that harsh interrogation techniques typically don’t work . In fact , rapport building is what works . We’re always having this discussion about the ticking bomb . </s>
The scenario that if we don’t get this information right away when we’re confronted with somebody who we believe has this sort of information , that lives will be at stake , and that we have to engage in these harsh interrogation techniques or , as we’ve just described , waterboarding . When Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded , and we now know that to be the case , he was waterboarded after he was in custody for thirty days . He was waterboarded because the agency , the CIA would argue , because what we were trying to get out of him we were n't getting out of him . Yet I have been able to speak to people who told me rhyme and verse about Abu Zubaydah . Abu Zubaydah is not what you think he was . </s>
Abu Zubaydah was a great travel agent . He was a logistics person . He was not what has been described , as a key Al Qaeda operative , quite the opposite . So when we engage in these techniques , there is a pushback from the opposition . And what does that pushback mean to you ? </s>
What does that mean to you and your families ? Because when we push back and when we engage in these type of techniques , the opposition is duty-bound , the enemy , as we’ve heard described here tonight , is duty-bound to get revenge . There is a constituency that you have not heard from tonight . And that is Al Qaeda . </s>
I am going to tell you what Al Qaeda has to say about torture . I am going to tell you what Sheikh bin Laden had to say about torture . And I 'm going to tell you that from the prospective of having to deal with Ali Abdul Saud Mohammed who created the Encyclopedia of Jihad . </s>
Who taught people what to do and not to do if in fact arrested by the unbelievers , we , the blood people . Bin Laden’s view was that any brother who was picked up and withstood torture for 72 hours , he and the other members of Al Qaeda would not seek revenge against him . Even bin Laden understood and did not take revenge against those who cooperated with the United States . </s>
Think about that for a moment . I can talk to you about Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi , which you’ve probably all heard about . </s>
I happened to be on the receiving end of a lot of information that Ibn al-Sheikh al-Libi was giving up to the FBI in Bagram , Afghanistan . Ibn al-Sheikh al- Libi is the man who’s alleged to have given information that was used in Colin Powell’s speech before the United Nations . Ibn al- Sheikh al-Libi agreed to cooperate with the United States… </s>
One . …through rapport building . And he agreed to cooperate with the United States , but he was duct taped , put into a cardboard- , or a , or plywood box , and shipped and rendered off to Egypt to be interrogated . He had agreed to cooperate with us . This was a policy decision that was made . </s>
Good counterterrorism policy has to include the end result of what we do , whether it’s on the battlefield or whether it’s on the streets of New York . Rapport building , treating people humanely , getting information , solid intelligence is what we’re after . </s>
There’s too much at stake , your safety is at stake , to engage in harsh interrogation techniques , which is going to cause the enemy to seek revenge against each of you . Thank you . I have one last question and only a few minutes to get an answer , and I 'm going to address the same question to both sides . And that is , is this foe different from the other foes that we’ve faced ? This foe has stated , especially the high-value prisoners , those on the inside of Al Qaeda have stated that it is- , they are ready for death . </s>
Can you break this foe by building a rapport ? Jack ? Rick ? </s>
Yeah , I’ll take that . Ideally , you want to break any foe . And Jack goes -- I mean , I agree that rapport building , if you have time , is the best way to go . The question is sometimes you don’t . </s>
The other point is sometimes you don’t have the time . But I believe this foe is a different one that we’ve ever -- than we’ve ever faced before . </s>
We’re not dealing with a state . We’re not dealing with someone with defined borders . </s>
The people -- these are not soldiers in an army . This is an ideal . This is a -- these are committed warriors in a religious battle . And I think that brings something that we’ve never dealt with before , and I do n't think we’re very well-prepared to do that . If just… </s>
And , and can I also add something that… Just briefly , here . …was already mentioned . The destructive power—this is an asymmetrical war as John said . </s>
The destructive power that now lies available to individuals that are not a member of the state , that can not be deterred as states can is unlike anything that we’ve faced before . With the… </s>
Let me just -- one sentence . …availability of nuclear weapons . Our distinguished colleagues don’t have their act together . Jack seems to be arguing that it is silly to counterproductively use stress techniques and accomplish reliable rapport . </s>
Nobody disagrees . Nobody would -- be a fool to suggest to promiscuously use stress techniques . But it’s equally foolish to say we should never use them . Because there may be circumstances where they’re necessary . And the true wisdom lies in ascertaining which one is which , and mistakes can be made . </s>
But wouldn’t it be a mistake , Jack , to just take something entirely off the table ? How… Do you think that everybody is subject to… So… …to the… </s>
Let me address… Where was the period ? …let me address this to Jack first . </s>
Because you raise the issue of rapport building as an effective way to get actionable intelligence… It’s the only effective way . …can… …well no , I -- that’s not what I 'm saying . </s>
I used the word rapport- building , certainly . Did I engage in harsh interrogation techniques ? Of course I did . But harsh doesn’t mean that I was engaging in sleep depravation . </s>
It doesn’t mean that I was engaging in some of these other techniques that we’ve now all identified . The harshest thing I ever had to do was to let somebody listen to Barry Manilow for twenty-four hours . That would be considered… Sounds awful . </s>
…you know… Doesn’t it ? Honestly . No . What , what I 'm saying is that we -- there is this supposition out there that Al Qaeda is everywhere . </s>
There’s a supposition that the Taliban , you know , is , is , is Al Qaeda and we fail to make distinctions between that . If I ask the audience tonight , and I’ll ask my distinguished colleagues up here , and David , you can be the first one . How many members of Al Qaeda do you think there are ? </s>
Oh boy . Is this , uh , multiple choice ? I mean , the other side is arguing that this enemy is so vast , so depraved , so craven , they want to kill thousands of us . There’s no question about that . There’s no question that , that what they want to do -- we saw that . </s>
But my point to you is , when I took the original membership lift off of Ali Mohammed , who are Al Qaeda , there were seventy-two members . There’s probably a lot more now . Well- , the sales stru- , the sales structure within Al Qaeda… Uh-huh . …consists of four to six operatives . </s>
You are trying to find , on a beach , a small dime . That’s what we’re up against . But Jack , that’s a different argument . </s>
I mean , it doesn’t matter whether they have a million or ten thousand , again , given the availability of weapons of mass destruction , that’s what we’re up against . </s>
And that’s the fear , that a small… </s>
What are the weapons of mass destruction that they have… …number of people… …airplanes ? </s>
You can- , there is the possibility of… </s>
They don’t have nuclear weapons . …nuclear weapons . Come on , Heather . </s>
Where , where ... . You don’t- , you think it’s not going to happen ? </s>
…you think Al Qaeda’s got nuclear weapons ? I 'm going to break in here . They’re seeking… Oh…come on… There’s- , it’s never- , it’s not a… </s>
They’re relentlessly seeking… a puzzle . I 'm glad , I 'm glad to… </s>
Rick may- , Rick may know this . Al Qaeda first tried to get fissionable material in 1993 . What they got was red mercury , they got scammed . And we got that from , what ? We got that from one of the guys that we cooperated with . </s>
So not only did we learn about what they were trying to do , we knew how they went about it . I hope that will prompt… There , the… </s>
…the audience to raise questions about the actual nature and the extent of the threat . I 'm going to be turning to you in just a moment . But first , I want to announce the results of the pre- debate vote . </s>
And before the debate , for the motion , which is -- , I want to have the exact wording here , “tough interrogation of terror suspects is necessary.” </s>
46 % of you voted for the motion . 35 % voted against the motion . 19 % were undecided . So , so much for some on the panel that thought this was going to be an excessively liberal audience . </s>
So , now I’d like to open up the floor for Q & A . Please stand up when you have your question . I ask that you don’t start to ask your question until you have the microphone , this is radio . Please make the questions short and to the point . </s>
And it would be great if members of the press would identify themselves as such . Have we got a question ready ? All right . The arguments on both sides so far have been mostly utilitarian . </s>
Torture works , torture doesn’t work . Torture has side effects . But there hasn’t been much said about the moral high ground , and America showing leadership in an ethical and moral universe . The “do unto others as you would have them do unto you.” What about the moral issue in here , which I think is a problem that many of us have ? </s>
Can I just say very briefly , let the record show , that nobody’s arguing on our side in favor of torture . </s>
The shame , frankly , the fault lies with the critics that damn everything with the T word and paint with a broad brush . </s>
We’re not talking about torture . We’re talking about the level of coerciveness and unpleasantness that permeates our spheres of public life without drawing any opposition from anybody . You tell me why in order for us to occupy the moral high ground we should eschew , give up , whatever verb you want to use , a level of coercion that is routinely used in other areas , including training of our own troops , specialized and advanced training , federal and state penitentiaries , boot camps for juvenile offenders . That makes no sense for us as a society to -- instead of having a common baseline that is not torture -- to have privileged , uniquely privileged- , only one set of people , captured Al Qaeda and Taliban terrorists . If that is morality , it’s silly . </s>
The… That’s David Rivkin . Darius Rejali ? </s>
Do you want to try this one on ? Sure . I’ll take that on . </s>
Look , you keep on saying that we do these things domestically and we should do them internationally and what’s the problem . Well , a couple of problems . First of all , let me just say a couple of things . </s>
A young professor comes to me and he says , “Could you tell me exactly what sexual harassment is ? </s>
I mean , if I do a little bit of it , is it ok ? ” You’d think that’s creepy , right ? These people are talking about , “Let’s do a little bit of it.” And it’s creepy . And it should creep you out , okay ? </s>
Because there are certain things you shouldn’t get anywhere near . The line between domestic and international , whatever you want to call these things , not torture , is a thin one . </s>
And every war that we have used torture , the Philippines , when we used that in the insurgency , those guys , they come home , what kind of jobs do they get ? They get jobs as policemen , prison guards , and your private security officials . And behind them follows torture . </s>
Or not torture , call it what you will . Chicago is paying twenty million dollars thanks to Mr. Burge and his fifty detectives who brought all their lovely techniques back from Vietnam . Look , at the end of this war , whether these guys get their way or not , people are coming back . And they’re going to be your cops , your neighborhood officials . </s>
They’re going to be your private people . And yes , there is a difference between domestic- international . But this stuff travels . </s>
Darius , do you… wait… Let me make another point , too . That if this… </s>
Why does… …is , if this is important for us to do , to save American lives because we’ve got this superhuman enemy that we have never faced before , because this foe is different and they are so dedicated , if this is important for us to do at some level , then to the moral imperative question , why should we stop at all ? Why not the rack ? Why not perfidy ? </s>
Why not treachery ? Why not all kinds of things ? Because if that’s the moral thing to do in order to save lives , then by George , we ought to be doing it across the board and not stopping ourselves anywhere short . </s>
I think that the world has relied , we’ve , the United States has been far from perfect . Our history is replete with examples of where we have failed in big things and in little things . But the world has relied on us to stand for the rule of law and for human rights . </s>
And it’s not a rule of law , if you only apply it when it’s convenient . And it’s not a human right if it only applies to some people . We need to stand tall in this , and not draw lines because this enemy is the worst enemy we have ever faced . I—I— </s>
I can—let me just argue that , first of all what we are doing is within the rule of law because a terrorist detainee is not covered by the Geneva Convention— It’s how you define the law— And—we are— he is covered by the Convention Against Torture , there is no question . We are obligated to follow the Convention Against Torture , that’s why it matters to make the distinctions that Darius refuses to . </s>
We are not arguing torture on this side . And Darius , you seem to think that the only possible set of questioning techniques are these random— it was rather arbitrary what got put into the Army Field Manual . </s>
You yourself know , there has been , contrary to the claims on the other side , there has been no serious empirical work on the—even on the Army Field Manual . Are you suggesting that those are the only possible… questioning techniques that can ever be used , and that somehow they are handed down from on high as the absolute way of questioning . </s>
There may have been 12 , if Mutt and Jeff had not originally been included in them , my guess is that if we were now pro—… Mutt and Jeff— —proposing— —are good cop-bad cop— </s>
Good cop-bad cop— —for people who don’t know the— </s>
—you would call that torture as well because that wouldn’t be in the Army Field Manual— No , actually , Heather , I think you’re getting— So that’s why I think again— </s>
—your distinctions quite all confused here— —we need to—we need to discuss— </s>
—whether stress is torture . All right— Heather , listen . </s>
I’m the one who argued for public cooperation , because Al Qaeda is living—is like a fish in a sea . </s>
You need to push it out of the water . It’s a small group of people , and you need to have Iraqi civilians come in and turn people and I have not been the one who argued for the interrogation manual . </s>
I have said , that all the studies show that unless you have public cooperation on your side , the chances that you will be able to clear and solve a crime will fall to 10 percent regardless of how you interrogate them , right . So it doesn’t matter what you throw at this problem , right . </s>
And the more you do your not-torture stuff , the more problematic it is , let me get to another thing . Barbaric , different kind of enemy , sure . </s>
They’re vengeful . And in the Middle East , they never forget . You know this . </s>
You know that in the Middle East they never forget . </s>
You can get away with this . Do they have weapons of mass destruction ? Well as I understand , Mr. al-Libi after he was beaten up by the Iraqis , by the Egyptians actually , said that , Saddam Hussein trained Al Qaeda in weapons of biological and chemical destruction . The Pentagon yesterday produced this huge report that proved that this was entirely false . But it went into the President’s speech in October in 2002 and it was part of the case that took us to war . </s>
And let me tell you , I don’t know how many lives these not- torture techniques have saved . But I can tell you how many lives it’s taken . It’s taken everybody who’s died . </s>
All right— </s>
Think—think about it— Now , wait a minute , I have to apologize , I have taken this debate out of sequence . And you guys are supposed to ask each other questions now , so— Let me hurry up and get some of those in . </s>
And if you don’t mind , I’ll begin with Heather . Heather , do you have a question for the other side . </s>
Well , I’m just puzzled by the idea that , with—if you have Khalid Shaikh Mohammed in detention , I’m not sure what the public cooperation is that you’re going to expect to get information from him . The 9-11 Commission report , you’re claiming that interrogation stress did not work . They said that half of the information in that report came from the interrogation of high- value— </s>
Is that the question ? Yeah , how do you—why are you disagreeing with the fact that , the interrogation of high-value detainees did produce valuable intelligence that allowed us to— </s>
Well , in—in the case of , in the case of Abu Zubaydah , the information that was of high value , was not stuff that he gave up after he was waterboarded . The real critical stuff was in the apartment where he was seized . He jumped out the back window and in the apartment was a treasure trove of computers , documents , cell phones and the like . And so when they end— started to do their routine grunt work , and do the document exploitation and all the other stuff , that’s what led ultimately to the arrest if you will or the capture of Khalid Shaikh , and Ramzi ben Al-Shif . </s>
That was Jack Cloonan . John Hutson , have you got a question for the other side ? Yes , I do . The side in favor of the proposition ? Yes . </s>
There’s been a lot of talk about the Army Field Manual and the difference now between DOD and the CIA . The President just recently vetoed the Intelligence Bill , which contained— would’ve made the CIA subject to the Army Field Manual . The Army Field Manual says , “Use of torture by US personnel would bring discredit upon the United States and its armed forces while undermining domestic and international support for the war effort.” Not making a distinction between the CIA and the army , just talking about domestic and intellectual support . </s>
“It could also place US and allied personnel in enemy hands at greater risk of abuse.” </s>
There’s a question there , right— Well , it—there’s going to be . </s>
Which of—now these— the Army Field Manual , or the Intelligence Bill that the Army Field—that would’ve incorporated the Army Field Manual , has the following prohibitions . Which of these prohibitions would you say is okay for the CIA , and therefore for the United States . Forcing a prisoner to be naked , perform sexual acts—and this is what the President vetoed . </s>
Forcing a prisoner to be naked , perform sexual acts or pose in a sexual manner . Placing hoods or sacks over the head of a prisoner , using duct tape over their eyes . Applying beatings , electric shocks , burns and other forms of physical pain , waterboarding , military working dogs , hypothermia or heat injure , mock-executions and depriving a prisoner if necessary of food , water and medical care . </s>
Now , which of those do you think it’s okay for the CIA on behalf of the United States to engage in , in order to get information . Rick , do you wan na take that one ? </s>
Well , since I think he’s reading from my article— No , actually I’m not . </s>
That’s the Field Manual , right . </s>
It’s— well , this is what the Army is prohibited from doing , I’m not saying the CIA should be allowed to do any or all of these , I’m just saying you shouldn’t extend this manual to the CIA , the CIA operates under different rules . But you were— </s>
But do you—do you want to go through and then the CIA— He—he’s asking—he gave you a multiple-choice question here because these were , this bill was vetoed— </s>
But that’s—with all due respect , John , that’s not all that the Army Field Manual does , my favorite example is , and I wish I had it in front of me . If you look at the definition of a good cop versus bad cop , there’s a restriction on how bad a bad cop can be . The bad cop can not act in a manner that’s disrespectful to the person being interrogated . </s>
I would submit to you it’s not a question of violating the law on the domestic side . In virtually every police station , the bad cop is pretty damn disrespectful to the drug dealers and rapists and muggers . We’re talking about using the rules we’re not using in our criminal justice system . That John is absurd , it’s insanity . It’s not morality— </s>
But he’s citing the— But he’s citing selectively . The Army Field Manual— </s>
And he’s asking you to respond selectively— My response is I have to defend all the good police officers and law enforcement officers out there . Because I can assure you that doesn’t go on as—as much as David suggested it does , it just doesn’t— What— Bad cop does not yell ? </s>
No— Spittle is not flying— I’m saying that— </s>
Threats are not made— </s>
But you keep— We’re not allowed to— —you keep talking—you keep talking— —grab somebody’s collar— </s>
—about these extreme views . You keep talking in the extreme . </s>
What I’m trying to argue here is and I think we’ve done it rather successfully , frankly , is to tell you— </s>
Little bias there Jack . —is to tell you…is to , is to tell you , that , that when you speak in the extremes and you speak in the absolutes , that there is going to be problems . I don’t think you have sat across the—maybe you have , maybe you have sat across the table from one of these guys , and tried to get information . </s>
Heather , maybe you have , I suspect that Rick has , I don’t know . But I will tell you if you had , you’d walk away from that experience being very humble…and understanding what you’re up against . To the gentleman’s question , about the moral imperative . If you think , ladies and gentlemen and my distinguished colleagues over here , that we can defeat this enemy , with guns and bullets , and throwing money at this , you’re wrong . </s>
This is an epic struggle , this is a struggle for the next generation , and it’s the biggest challenge that we’re gon na have to face . And I don’t want to make it any more difficult than what it is . </s>
And when you engage in some of the things that have been , I’m not saying some of the things that we’ve discussed here tonight , you make that challenge a lot harder for us . David , do you have a question— Two very good questions— </s>
—David Rivkin—do you— One question for the other side— Why—all right— —against the motion— Why do you claim , that false , misleading information and lying only emanates from people who are being interrogated stressfully , the last time I checked , every criminal , every terrorist routinely lies and your job as an interrogator is to sift the truth from fiction . Isn’t it the case that the biggest problem is , when a person says nothing , zero , nada . </s>
Not the fact that somebody’s lying because you have enough time to cross-reference things , you can learn as much from lying , as from a person doing truth- telling , but everybody lies . Okay . Does anybody want— There’s— No kidding . Well , look , there’s lots of collection— </s>
Bad guys—bad guys lie— —the question is analysis . </s>
Look . The guilty will lie no more nor —nor less , the problem is a selection problem . You have a fuzzy context in which you can’t tell who is a big fish , who’s a small fish . </s>
Who is Al Qaeda , who isn’t . These are people who hide as ordinary civilians , you’ve all admitted this , right ? So you have a selection problem . </s>
You have to pull in large numbers of people , and there , you have to decide who is guilty and who is innocent . The guilty , you’re right , absolutely will lie no more or less if you do whatever you want to do to them , right ? But the innocent , oh my God . If you start torturing—torturing the innocent to 20 to 78 at that rate , you’re going produce a mound of false information . You’re weighing down the exact war effort you want to win . </s>
And not only that , I ask you , what American value does it promote to torture 20 to 78 innocents to get your one hit ? Actually Darius—Darius , it’s your time to ask a question— </s>
And I just asked that question— Do you wan na ask that ? Yeah . </s>
Did you guys get that— But that’s a straw man , nobody is suggesting that this administration , much-maligned , has used— has used the stress interrogation techniques , against very few high- value detainees . And whether or not a given individual as Jack suggested , was more of a braggart , or , versus a real mastermind . He wasn’t innocent , the few people who were subjected to those things were anything but innocent . Look— </s>
Torture is like virginity— I don’t think— </s>
—once you’ve done it… Go ahead— —you’re torturer . You know , it’s a one-time deal , if we , it’s not necessary counting , or saying , well…these people above these lines are high-values , so we can torture them , below this line , they’re not , so , you know , once you’ve done it , once you’ve engaged in it , that’s who you are as a nation . John , we’re not talking— </s>
And you’ve got to— </s>
—here is what you are suggesting—first of all , you guys don’t have your act together . The two people on both sides are making a utilitarian argument , it doesn’t work , we don’t need it . You’re making an absolute argument that there are certain things called torture that you should never do . Actually we agree . The question is this , are we gon na be a mature society , have a serious discourse about what is or isn’t torture , it’s distasteful , but it’s necessary , are we just going to clap our hands and say everything is torture . </s>
Well , a mature society has to debate about what good counter- terrorism policy is , not what good torture is . Rick , have you raised— I’m sorry , hold on a moment . Rick Francona , do you have a question for the side against the motion— </s>
I suppose I can form this in a— Can I— —question . No , you can’t , Rick has to go . All right . </s>
I’m sorry— </s>
—I think it was Darius , you said that the motivation for cooperation the public…you used the public cooperation is how you would round these guys up . I don’t—I’m not sure that’s always the case , would you say that’s why Al Qaeda in Iraq is being taken apart by the Anbar cooperative group out there , they’re doing it because we’re gon na kill them , not because we’re not going to be nice to them . You know , one of the nasty things about Al Qaeda , and this is true about all terrorist torture , let’s be clear , these people are barbarians , right , they chop off heads . They’re incompetent at it , they know they’re going to get a rise out of us . </s>
I have relatives , let me just be—I’ll be honest with you . I have relatives who used to collect eyeballs . Right ? Beheading is ridiculous as , it’s clearly a bait , and it’s clearly designed to get us to make mistakes . </s>
Now , one of the things any Oriental ruler would have known , is not to fall for that bait , right ? Terrorists don’t have fixed assets , they don’t have jails , they don’t have places , they have to be on the run , they have to depend on safe houses . What I’m finding right now in Al-Anbar , is we’re finding torture chambers . </s>
You know what that means ? It means they’re feeling comfortable enough to build torture chambers . That is not good . But wait a minute , it doesn’t work so it must hurt them more than it helps them— Oh—it works— I’ll tell you what it works for . </s>
It works to intimidate , it works to make false confessions . </s>
I am happy to stipulate that , although I will say this too . We have all the records of French torture from the Ancien Regime . And we know that these guys boiled people’s feet in oil . </s>
They water- boarded . Do you know how many actually said anything ? </s>
Do we have a single document left of a confession , three to 14 percent . That’s what false confessions are . And let’s not even worry about the true and false confe— The other part of this is , you think that , well , if the guy breaks , oh , we’ll know whether it’s true or not . Again , 40 years of psychological research will tell you this , we’re really , really bad at telling the difference between truth and lies , even interrogators , we’ve tested them , I’m sorry . There is no argument here . </s>
Jack Cloonan— It sounds to me like— —Jack Cloonan , please direct the next question , to— I’ll direct this to Rick . </s>
Rick…what is the best way , to get quality , actionable intelligence to protect this audience . </s>
I don’t think there’s an argument , I agree with what you said . Establishing rapport— Come sit over here . </s>
Well—yeah— Yeah , Rick , I don’t understand what you’re doing over there , I honestly don’t . </s>
I mean— we got Rick . There’s a comma here . Given—you know , in a perfect world , and if you had time to establish that rapport . </s>
But many times , you don’t have the time to do that , you’re not sure you have the time to do that , the biggest problem is not what you know about a suspect , it’s about what you don’t know . And what you don’t know is what’s the timeline . And you have to get to that very quickly . And if you have any reason to believe that he’s got , you know , information of an imminent value , then you’ve got to ramp up the treatment . You know , ideally if you think this guy , okay , this is a low-level Taliban guy who probably doesn’t know much , let’s sit down and talk to him , and find out who he might know , where the training camps here , the routine order of battle kind of stuff you’d want to prosecute a war . </s>
But if you grab a guy , maybe bin Laden’s driver who was driving a set of orders somewhere , but you don’t know where , be nice to know where that is before the action happens . I would now like to open up the floor to a couple of other questions , we’ve run long . Sure , right over there . Hi , — </s>
Can you wait for the microphone , it’s coming your way . …from Commentary magazine , my question is for Heather Mac Donald . </s>
Heather , help me out here with your teammates on this waterboarding question . I heard Rick Francona say , when he was subjected to it voluntarily , he broke after 30 seconds . David Rivkin says 60 to 90 seconds , isn’t torture . </s>
That seems like a long time for some— if Rick Francona has it—has it right , and… Second , Rick Francona cites Michael Scheuer and George Tenet as sources saying that waterboarding was effective . But…are those two credible ? Is George Tenet credible , he of the slam-dunk assessments and Michael Scheuer , who is going around the country saying that Israel is running clandestine operations against the United States , through the Holocaust Museum ? Well , that’s—quite a question . </s>
Well , I wasn’t aware of Michael Schauer’s testimony , I would rely on the 9-11 Commission report , I don’t know what the relevance of the seconds that people have held out , but…clearly we have gotten actionable intelligence from the high-value CIA detainees . </s>
What I—what I don’t understand is obviously we do need to think about this , not just as a utilitarian matter but a moral one . But why is it necessary , the moral position , to say that , we are not going to use stress on a single Al Qaeda detainee , and risk the possible destruction of hundreds if not thousands of innocent civilians , I—to me it—it’s not clear that the moral position , puts more value on the protecting of temporary extreme discomfort of one person who is pledged to destroy as many Americans as he can , that that’s moral to protect him , and to sacrifice thousands of American lives , the idea that stress does not work , never works , is an easy out . The fact is is that , regimes have used…torture , again , which is not what we are arguing for today . </s>
But even torture , has been shown to work , the French used it in the Algerian war , and they got information— </s>
Oh— Oh , God— —they did— And now they know— They used— </s>
Let’s hear that one— That’s— Let’s hear the evidence , let’s hear the evidence . </s>
24,000 arrests . </s>
24,000 police arrests…let’s call them torture warrants , right ? To catch what , how many in the Casbah ? Do you know how many there were ? </s>
You guys don’t know how many Al Qaeda there were— I actually do— We— Okay . </s>
Well—there were— There were— All right , we are ready now for— 1400 . </s>
1400 . 24,000 torture for 1400 , most of whom actually died and went over to the French as informers . We’ve run nearly out of time , I want everybody to have their two- minute closing remarks . Can we begin with John Hutson , against the motion . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Thank you all for your patience . </s>
I started out some time ago now talking about the various considerations in—that we’ve been talking about today , tonight . Legal , moral , diplomatic , practical . But let me go to the one very quickly that I think is , for me , most convincing . </s>
The enemy can’t beat us militarily . They’ve gotten a lift—they’ve gotten very little communication . They’ve got IED’s , they’ve got suicide bombers , they can not defeat the United States of America militarily . But I’ll tell you how we can lose this war on terror…we can commit national suicide . </s>
And the way we’ll commit national suicide , is by disarming ourselves , giving up our greatest weapon , and our greatest weapon isn’t our military might , or our natural resources , or the essential island nature of our land-mass— One . It sure as heck isn’t our economy right now . </s>
Our great strength is—Bono and Thomas Paine had it right—is who we are . And if we give up who we are , who we are as a nation , that’s a victory for the enemy . The enemy knows he can’t defeat us militarily . Killing us isn’t their goal . Our will to win , defeating our will to win isn’t the enemy’s goal . </s>
The enemy’s goal in the war on terror is to bring us down to them , to make us ever so slightly more like they are . To make us as miserable and pathetic as they are . And if we engage in the same tactics…they will have won that particular battle . </s>
Thank you— Heather ? Thank you very much , John Hutson , now Heather Mac Donald for the motion . Well , I agree with the opponents that we need as many highly trained interrogators as we can get , they should be as fully versed in language and cultural skills and that has—clearly has been a weakness . </s>
But I would submit that the trained interrogators with the CIA were facing resistance that the existing tools that they had available to them were not able to overcome . And I don’t believe that the 16 army interrogation rules are the only possible interrogation techniques that should ever be available as we face an enemy that is not going to seek revenge because we are using stress , because they wanted to kill us 30 years ago , 40 years ago , and destroy as much as we can . I think that there are going to be times when— One . —stress is necessary . </s>
If we are facing an imminent threat , if we have somebody with , with knowledge of the next plot , we’re not going to have time to spend the months that it can take to build rapport . And if using stress on somebody with knowledge of the next terrorist attack is necessary to save thousands of American lives , I think that it is acceptable and lawful and moral to do so . Again— Against the motion , Darius Rejali . Is it better to be loved or feared . </s>
Loved or feared . The correct answer is that if you can fight with one hand tied behind your back and win , you will be loved and feared . If—and that’s the American way . If you want to be merely loved , you’ll be despised , if you really want to be feared , you’ll be despised . My great- grandfather wanted to be feared . </s>
He was a very powerful Persian prince . He didn’t hesitate to torture and kill anyone who got in his way . He cloaked his values in blood . And no one misses him today , and his world is gone . </s>
I accepted this invitation today , regardless of this debate , win or lose , just to tell you all one thing I know . Don’t make the same mistake my great-grandfather did . Don’t make the same mistake the Shah of Iran did . No one will miss you either . Do not close the values that I have come to this country for , do not close them in blood and make them a sham . </s>
I am really tired of having to move… One . </s>
…and your parents were really tired of having to move . </s>
Look , you can follow bagpipes into battle if you want , but the reality doesn’t change . In the end the Pied Piper keeps on playing all that hot air , the boys at the front die , and the pipers go back to the think tanks and have fine careers . </s>
You can’t have—you can’t win a football game with a bunch of Hail Marys , you can’t do it based on interrogation based on faith . We’ve told you the only thing that really works . Public cooperation , rapport-building . And if you’re still on the fence and you don’t know where to vote , I just have it on good authority by the way , that Rick Francona is a card-carrying member of Red Sox Nation . For the motion , David Rivkin . </s>
We are facing a very serious threat . One of the reasons that is the case , it’s not a question of numbers , it’s not a question of technology , it’s the question of dedication . It’s been decades since we fought people , who no matter how twisted and warped the ideology is , willing to commit the most inhuman acts , sacrificing not only themselves , mothers bringing their children up to die . </s>
Expressing pride at that . The force of that compulsion , of that conviction , is tremendously dangerous . I would suggest to you that we’ve heard a lot of emotional statements today . In my opinion not emanating from our side of , of this equation , but I ask you to use your rule of reason . </s>
We as human beings are all about making nuances , whether we’re dealing with our kids , our co-workers , dealing with our government . The human—what we’ve heard repeatedly from our opponents , is , extolling you not to try to draw distinctions , not to try to rule the rule of reason . One— But basically , adopt a rigid…unyielding framework , suggesting that anything that deviates from this framework , but degrees of coercion , which by the way are practiced in the criminal justice system , would absolutely allow most criminals to go free , because we’d not be able to suggest them to any psychological coercion , or frighten them , or their family members in any way . </s>
That is not the way America has gotten to where it is . This is not the way you’re gon na lead your own lives , this is not the way you’re gon na lead your professional lives , why should you lead that approach as citizens of this great body politic , use the rule of reason , and don’t worry about anecdotes about Spanish Inquisition , or the Iranian secret police . Against the motion , Jack Cloonan . I think honestly that we all on this stage tonight have learned something about each other and I think that we all want to get to the same position . </s>
I firmly believe that . I think that we have a different way of going about it . And we may differ in methodology . </s>
I believe on our side and our argument , and I’m not making this just based on moral grounds , I’m making this from the position of a utilitarian , practical application of what I know to work . And that because we have such a huge deficit in our ability to collect solid , good intelligence , I don’t want to waste the time trying to find that little dime I mentioned to you on the beach . </s>
We don’t have time to do that , the enemy as David suggested is very committed . </s>
Bin Laden has issued a fatwa and in that fatwa he has declared war on the United States and he has said it is the duty of every good Muslim to kill Americans . One— Where do they find them . The question is , how am I going to protect you . </s>
How is our government going to protect you . And the best way to do that it seems to me , is what we’ve been advocating on this side . </s>
Let’s be clear . </s>
Stress can be defined any number of ways . What we’re talking about are extreme measures . </s>
And those extreme measures don’t work…haven’t worked , and it sets us up for cataclysmic results , which means , as Darius pointed out , revenge of the worst sort . And we haven’t seen the worst yet . We haven’t seen the repercussions of what Abu Ghraib has represented and others . Trust me when I say that . For the motion , Rick Francona . </s>
I was struck by your question , sir , and I really appreciate you asking that , about the moral ground , you know , do we lose by not adhering to the moral high ground . </s>
Trust me , and I think all of us are on the same tier , no one wants to use these techniques as a matter of course . No one enjoys this , from those of us who have done this , it’s not a very pleasant experience . But we don’t live in a perfect world . </s>
We didn’t create that world , and it is inhabit by people who wan na kill us . And I’m not sure revenge is the factor it’s their stated goal in life , for whatever reason . Is this utilitarian ? Yes . It’s the mission of , of the intelligence community and the armed forces to protect the country , through whatever means are—is legally possible . </s>
And when you’re lucky enough to get your hands on one of these suspects—and it’s very difficult to do , how do you find them . These are all very good points . </s>
Once you get your hands on one , you have to be able to get the information you need . If the rapport-building works , great . If it doesn’t , you’ve got ta be able— </s>
One . —to ratchet it up , and get what you have to have . They can’t defeat us militarily , but I am not willing to risk the death of thousands of Americans just on the moral high ground . I just , you can’t have it both ways . </s>
Thank you all very much . Now it’s time , now it’s time for you to decide who carried the day , once again , please pick up the keypad attached to the left armrest of your seat , after my prompt , press “1” if you are for the motion…“Tough Interrogation of Terror Suspects is Necessary.” “2” if you are against the motion , “3” if you are undecided , please cast your vote now . </s>
I want to thank the debaters and the audience for their good work . Before I announce the results of the audience vote , I just want to take care of a couple of things . </s>
The next Intelligence Squared US debate will be on Tuesday , April 15th , here at Asia Society and Museum . The motion to be debated is , “Islam is Dominated by Radicals.” It will be moderated by NPR’s Robert Siegel , the panelists for the next debate are , for the motion , vice- president of research at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies , Daveed Gartenstein Ross , senior fellow at the Hudson Institute , Paul Marshall , and former reporter for The Wall Street Journal and visiting scholar at Georgetown University , Asra Q. Nomani . </s>
Against the motion will be assistant professor at the University of California , Riverside , and Senior Fellow at the USC Center on Public Diplomacy , Reza Aslan , Professor of History at Columbia University Richard Bulliet , and Edina Lekovic , Director of Communications for the Muslim Public Affairs Council . An edited version of tonight’s Intelligence Squared US debate can be heard here locally here on WNYC-AM 820 on Sunday , March 23rd , at 8 pm . These debates are also heard at 140 NPR stations across the country and you can check your local NPR member station listings for the time and dates for broadcasts outside of New York City . </s>
you had 46 percent in favor , 35 against , and 19 undecided . After the debate , you have 40 percent in favor , 53 percent against , and 7 percent undecided . </s>
Thank you very much . Ladies and gentlemen we are going to go right now to the vote where we ask for your party affiliation , or lack thereof . There’s a keypad to the left of your seat , and we’ve designated number 1 to stand for Democrat , number 2 for Republican , and 3 is Independent , and three would also cover Communist Party , Libertarian , etcetera… Sorry about that . But to a degree I think that’s what we’re discussing here tonight . So if you take just a minute to do that and we’ll lock it in and then we’ll begin the debate . </s>
Number 1 is for Democrat , number 2 is for Republican , and 3 is Other . We’d like your cell phones off except for the few who have decided to tweet throughout the event , about the event . </s>
Our name on Twitter is @ iq2us and we’re using # 2partydebate . </s>
And now let’s welcome our debaters to the stage . </s>
And it is a true pleasure to introduce the man who has made Intelligence Square U.S. possible . It 's why there is an IQ2 U.S. Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Well , thank you and welcome . It 's my task to frame the debate . Why did we do this particular debate ? </s>
And the question , of course , is , is America ungovernable ? Well , neither the most liberal Democrats nor the most conservative Republicans can govern the way they like . </s>
Our system demands compromise and change by slow increments . And that 's exactly what the founders intended . </s>
Both parties have always had different philosophy of government and different takes on major policy issues . But for most of the past 50 years , there 's been a sense that politics stops at the water 's edge , that we wo n't let partisan politics jeopardize America 's security or our standing in the world . And in domestic policy , the biggest initiatives such as civil rights , welfare reform , the NAFTA free trade pact , Medicare , Medicaid , all have substantial bipartisan support . </s>
Well , what I am describing is hardly what politics today are like . Both parties seem to be dominated by their most extreme elements . And the center is driven from the corridors of power . Indeed , the rarity of truly civil discourse in our society is precisely what prompted the creation of the Intelligence Squared debate series in the first instance . Well , how did things get this way ? </s>
I would point to three developments , each of which quite ironically seem , on the face of it , to enhance democracy . First , the primary system for selecting candidates has evolved into a highly compressed series of campaigns that require well over a hundred million dollars to contest effectively . Second , the campaign finance reform has required that those vast sums be raised in $ 2,000 pieces . And it 's often the most emotional and intemperate rhetoric that prompts folks to write those checks . Finally , the media environment has become highly fragmented , encouraging people to gravitate to news outlets that will enforce their views and drive them even further from centrist positions . </s>
But whether I 'm right or wrong about the reasons , it 's hard to dispute that the two parties are as far apart as they have been in our lifetimes . Does that mean that America is ungovernable ? To help you decide , we have with us tonight some of our most brilliant political commentators . And it 's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator , John Donvan . </s>
Thank you . </s>
And once again , I just want to say thank you to Robert Rosenkranz for making all of this possible . True or false , the two-party system is making America ungovernable . </s>
Let 's have it out . </s>
That 's what we are here to debate under the auspices of Intelligence Squared U.S. , I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University where we have two teams of debaters , two members each . Arianna Huffington and David Brooks are arguing for the motion . </s>
They want to convince you that the two-party system is making America ungovernable . Here to try to make nonsense of that argument , their opponents , Zev Chafets and P.J . O'Rourke . Now , this is a debate . There will be a winner and a loser . And you , our live audience here at the Skirball Center , will be the judges . </s>
By the time the debate has ended , we will have asked you to vote two times , once before you 've heard the arguments and once again afterward . </s>
And the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the debate will be declared our winner . So let 's go to your preliminary vote . Our motion is “The two-party system is making America ungovernable.” </s>
If you agree with this motion , press number one on your keypad . The keypad is to your left . </s>
If you disagree , press number two . </s>
And if you are undecided , press number three . And if you think that you have pressed a key in error , just correct your mistake , and the system will lock in your last vote . All right . It looks like everybody 's completed that . We 'll be presenting the results of that vote and the concluding vote at the end of the debate . </s>
So onto round one . Our motion is “The two-party system is making America ungovernable.” </s>
In round one , uninterrupted opening statements by each debater in turn . They are seven minutes each . And here to argue , to convince that you the two-party system is making America ungovernable , Arianna Huffington , who is now president and editor-in-chief of the Huffington Post media group . Interestingly , Arianna , you were born in a country that now has five viable parties in its parliament . </s>
You came of age intellectually in a country that has three viable parties in its parliaments and you are now living in a country that has two parties , is there a trend , meaningful trend ? Yes , I am fast moving toward one party rule . Ladies and gentlemen , Arianna Huffington . </s>
Thank you so much . David and I are here to convince you that indeed the two-party system has rendered this country ungovernable . And the evidence is all around us . </s>
Wherever you look you see that we can only produce suboptimal solutions to our deepest crisis . </s>
And if you have any doubt about that just look around . </s>
Why do we still have banks that we have deemed to be too big to fail ? Why did our two-party system produce three major disasters in recent years ? The financial meltdown , the mining disaster that left 29 miners dead in West Virginia , the BP oil spill , just to mention three major disasters , that were produced as a result of our completely dysfunctional two-party system . </s>
And , you know , for many , many years we’ve kind of postponed solving our big problems , we’ve postponed dealing with our deficit , we 've postponed dealing with the decline of the middleclass , we 've postponed dealing with our crumbling infrastructure , we 've postponed dealing with our deteriorating education system . Well , we can no longer keep postponing dealing with these problems . </s>
So while the two-party system might have been okay during the ordinary times , we’re not living in ordinary times right now . We actually have to solve our problems , we have no more reserves , we’ve run out of time , the chickens have come home to roost . And the problem with the two-party system is that is has made us all prisoners of conventional wisdom . </s>
It’s made us look at every political problem through that obsolete prism of right versus left . In fact our political problems are not susceptible to that easy completely reductionist way of looking at them . Let’s take Afghanistan , the media consider anybody who wants to leave Afghanistan as a lefty . In fact George Will , the Cato Institute , Pat Buchanan , Joe Scarborough , and many conservative intellectuals see no reason for us to be pursuing an unwinnable war at huge expense . Let’s look at reforming Wall Street . </s>
There are many good capitalists who sleep with a copy of Ayn Rand’s books under their pillow , who believe that Wall Street desperately needs reforming if it’s going to actually operate like a capitalist system as opposed to operating like an oligarchy , crony , system where losses are socialized and gains are privatized . </s>
Nevertheless the two-party system makes that kind of thinking impossible because we continue to see everything through that obsolete binary prism . But look around , the favorability ratings of the two parties are constantly declining . </s>
We now have Dems at about 39 percent favorability rating and Republicans at 34 percent . And the last election despite all the attention , despite all the media hoopla only 42 percent of the electorate voted . This is an enormous amount of dissatisfaction in the political system to have so many people not even participating in that most elementary duty of citizenship voting . And then let’s look at what would have happened in any other section of our life if we had such a vacuum . </s>
There would have been more competition ; there would have been more participation from others , but not in our political system . Indeed inordinate amounts of power is folded in the hands of a few so-called centrist senators , like Olympia Snowe , do you remember during the healthcare debate for 14 months Democrats did everything they could to woo Olympia Snowe . They are like lovelorn high schoolers who are just not getting the message that she was just not into them . And John Adams predicted what would happen when he said that “there is nothing I dread so much as a division of the Republic into two great parties each arranged under its leader and converting measures in opposition to each other.” </s>
But that’s exactly what we have done . And the hunger for change is overwhelming . The election of Barack Obama is evidence of that , the rise of the Tea Party is evidence of that . </s>
There is huge mistrust of our national institutions , politicians , business people , the media . And the rise of social media , the rise of the Internet has made it possible for young people especially to connect with each other , to reject the existing system , to opt out of politics and try to find solutions in their own communities , bypassing the political system . That’s not ultimately healthy because democracy is not a spectator sport . </s>
And if we’re going to revive democracy , if we’re going to overcome all the obstacles in the way of a truly Democratic system , you know , the way we have the huge advantages of incumbency , the difficulty of ballot access , the gerrymandering of our districts . </s>
If we’re going to overcome all these things , we need to actually bring more competition and more voices and fresh thinking to our political system . Because as Einstein put it , to paraphrase him , the problems we are facing right now can not be solved at the same level of thinking that created them . And that’s all that the two parties are capable of . </s>
So , let me just end by quoting Thomas Jefferson . In a letter to Francis Hopkinson , he said , “I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of man whatever , in religion , in philosophy , in politics , or in anything else , while I was capable of thinking for myself . Such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent . </s>
If I could not go to Heaven but with a party , I would not go to Heaven at all.” </s>
Well , it’s here that our two-party system is not taking us to Heaven . In fact , it’s rapidly taking us in the other direction . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Arianna Huffington . Our motion is “The two-party system is making America ungovernable , ” and here to speak against the motion is P.J . O’Rourke , a journalist , a political satirist . Does it say that on your business card ? </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Yes . He is the author of 13 books , including “Don’t Vote -- It Just Encourages the Bastards.” Ladies and gentlemen , P.J . O’Rourke . </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Thank you . </s>
Thank you . You know , I agree with Arianna about the utter cowardice and perfect ineffectuality of the two major political parties in dealing with any of the political problems that we face , and I would simply concede the debate if I were able to imagine some other political party or independent candidate -- left , right , or fanatically middle-of-the-road -- who would do a better job . It’s like trying to imagine a politician who would get up on the campaign stump and say , “No , I can’t fix public education . The problem isn’t under-funding or over-crowding or teachers’ unions or a lack of a voucher system or absence of computer equipment in the classroom . </s>
The problem is your damn kids.” He wouldn’t get elected . And the problem is us damn voters . And it’s not our political parties , be they few or many . We have voted ourselves more government benefits than we care to pay for . </s>
And we’re broke . And , you know , so are all the other democracies in the world , no matter how many political parties they have . Indeed , other countries that aren’t democracies face the same problem . Everybody’s broke except China . </s>
And China has a per capita GDP of just $ 7,400 a year , as compared to the Dominican Republic’s per capita GDP of $ 8,600 a year . So the Chinese are broke too . So , given that we’re the problem , we might as well stick with the system that we’ve got . I mean , after all , we’re the ones who invented it . </s>
It must suit our needs in some way . The American two-party system is not a very good political system , but we Americans are not very good at politics . </s>
We’re just not . I mean , we don’t seek the good things in life from politics . We seek the good things in life from pluck and luck . </s>
You will notice that more people are interested in the New York State Lottery than are interested in the New York State government . </s>
Now , I would argue in favor of America’s two-party system not because of America’s two political parties but because America doesn’t really have political parties at all . I mean , we certainly don’t have political parties in the ideological sense . Republicans and Democrats do n't have ideologies . They just have these vague platform planks made of rotten wood of political expediency ? </s>
If American party platforms were backyard tree forts , you would not let your children climb in them . Anyone can join an American political party , even a witch . No one can be thrown out of an American political party . God knows my fellow Republicans , I have been trying with Sarah Palin , and you see where it 's gotten us ? Instead of political parties , what we have in America is two fund- raising mechanisms for a pair of general human tendencies . </s>
The tendency to leave things all screwed up like they 've always been and the tendency to get the government involved and screw things up more . Democrats are the party that says government can make us all richer , smarter , taller , thinner . Get the crab grass out of our lawns , you know ? The Republicans are the party that says government does n't work and then they get elected , and then they prove it . We have the stupid party , and we have the silly party . </s>
Now , I belong to the stupid party . I vote Republican because Republicans have fewer ideas . Not few enough as you may have noticed in Iraq , but you know . Stupid party and the silly party . That would seem to me to cover the range of human political thought . </s>
What do we want to add to that ? The insane party ? The confused party , the violent party , the drunken , naked party . Well , maybe . </s>
Now , if the key question is governability , two-party system , they 've done pretty well by world historical systems , little glitch in 1860 . </s>
We 're used to the idea of political parties causing civil wars , Spain , Vietnam , Nicaragua . But in the case of our own civil war , both the Whigs and the Democrats split on the issue of slavery , thereby in fact actually delaying our civil war for more than a decade which may very well have ensured that the right side won in our civil war . </s>
Our two political parties , silly and stupid as they may be , they 've shown an ability to reconstitute or replace themselves when the nation needs it most . The Republican party came from the mess of the Whigs and the anti-slavery Democrats in time to win the Civil War . The Democratic party realigned , broke the power of the dixiecrats in time to win the battle for civil rights , you know . </s>
Even in these days of supposed extreme political polarization between Republicans and Democrats , there is a big overlap of feelings and ideas . You know , the rich should get richer but only if I 'm one of them , right ? The poor need help , but ca n't they knock it off with the drugs , the crime , the tattoos and the dumb music ? We see this overlap in the number of Americans -- I 'm sure many of you will be among them -- who tell pollsters they are independent or , as many of us put it when we 're phoned by pollsters , `` Go to hell . I 'm eating dinner . '' </s>
But to be completely outside the two-party system just deprives candidates of any need for a sort of broad appeal , which is why America 's third parties have been weird -- anti- Masonic party , trying to keep my dad from wearing a fez and riding around on a tiny motorcycle . The know-nothing party , the name says it all . The greenback party . They wanted money to be worth less . </s>
That dream came through . </s>
So , we Republicans had Teddy Roosevelt which got us Woodrow Wilson in World War I . You Democrats had Ralph Nader who got you George W. Bush and the Iraq war . In the matter of political systems , never believe that they ca n't get worse . </s>
And in the matter of our two-party political system , I would say dance with the one that brung ya ' . Thank you . Thank you , P.J . O'Rourke . </s>
Here 's where we are . </s>
We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have four debaters , two teams of two , who are fighting it out over this motion : “The two-party system is making America ungovernable.” </s>
You have heard the first two debaters and now on to the third to speak for this motion , to argue that the two-party system is making America ungovernable , I want to introduce David Brooks , who is a columnist , op/ed columnist for the New York Times and a commentator on the News Hour . And , David , I find it interesting that your debating partner , your teammate , Arianna Huffington , started on the right and moved to the left . And you as a young man making your way through the world started on the left and moved to the right . What happened in your case ? </s>
Wisdom . Ladies and gentlemen , David Brooks . Arianna , I ca n't explain . So the defender of the two-party system starts out by conceding that parties are cowardly , ineffectual and stupid and so stands by the proposition that we ca n't do any better , which is good counter programming toward Obama standing on a position of hopelessness and changelessness , more or less standing up for the `` Let 's go suck on a gas pipe '' party . </s>
And I suggest you support P.J . if you have Jack Kevorkian on your speed dial , that we ca n't do any better . But then in the middle of his remarks , a sort of miracle occurs , and after telling us how stupid the parties are , suddenly he decides they are about to reconstitute themselves into something not half bad . </s>
P.J . and I are old friends , and I know he took a lot of drugs in the '60s . Call Rockefeller University . Apparently , they 're still hanging around . Now , Arianna spoke about the broad dysfunction of our parties . </s>
I 'm going to speak about the narrow dysfunction , especially in Washington where I cover it . I cover politicians very closely . And I can tell you , from this context , politicians are all emotional freaks of one sort or another . They have what I call logorrhea dementia , which is they talk so much they drive themselves insane . </s>
But they do have these intense social antennae so they , if you meet them , they will guarantee to invade your personal space . They 'll stand too close , rub the back of your head . I was campaigning with Mitt Romney up in New Hampshire once , and he was campaigning in a diner with his five perfect sons , Bip , Chip , Rip , Lip , Sip and Dip . And we go in the diner . </s>
He introduces himself to a family and then says , “What village in New Hampshire are you from ? ” And then he describes the home he owned in their village . And then he goes around the diner and then first-names everybody on the way out . So they 're weird social creatures . Nonetheless , I would say in general , they are better people than one would anticipate . </s>
Most of them are in it for the right reason , but they 're stuck in a rotten system . They 're stuck in our current two-party system which forces them to behave in ways that are worse than they are . It 's a mind suck . First of all , they can not be entrepreneurial . </s>
They can not think for themselves because they have to hew the party line . They get -- every Tuesday . They go to a lunch . </s>
They get the message of the week . They have to parrot the message of the week . It 's a soul suck . They ca n't behave nicely or even get to know the people in the other party because there are unofficial barriers . </s>
I went to something called the Civility Conference where Annenberg took House members from both parties to the Green Briar Hotel and got them to work together , or to meet together . And I went to the dining room . </s>
It was like junior high , all the Republicans over here , all the Democrats over here . They know nothing about each other . When a member of a party starts describing to me the -- what 's going to happen on the other side , I know everything they 're about to tell me is wrong because they know nothing about each other . </s>
Finally , it 's freedom destroying . They come in wanting to cut deals , talking in private about what they 'd like to achieve . But they 're in a tribal mentality in what -- what they can achieve is severely limited by the tribal sort of Tutsi versus Hutu nature of our politics of the current two-party system . So as a result , they find themselves unable to lead the lives they 'd like to lead . </s>
Arianna talked about how the big problems are therefore not addressed because they are stuck in these little trenches . These problems come up every day , the squeezing of the middle class unaddressed . I would talk about today 's story , the issue of the budget . We are facing a fiscal meltdown in this country . </s>
And if you took individuals outside the party context that we have now , I bet we could all cut a deal . We could figure out what taxes needed to go up and what spending needs to go down . </s>
But we 're stuck in this dysfunctional marriage where , first of all , 85 percent of the budget is completely off the table because neither party wants to touch it . Secondly , you 've got the Republicans who at least have big ideas for cutting the spending . </s>
But they have no idea what spending should be cut and what is n't , so they 're cutting some of our most valuable programs like Head Start and early childhood education because that 's the party dogma . Then on the Democrat side , they 've got some decent ideas to save Head Start and early childhood education . </s>
But the present -- the Democrats have no persuasive ideas so we can actually cut the budget deficit and avoid national bankruptcy by 2015 or 2019 . In 2019 , we will be paying interest on the debt equal to about 800 , $ 900 billion . And this problem has been building and building and building . We are completely unable to solve it because the Republicans refuse to raise taxes , which is going to have to happen , the Democrats refuse to talk about Medicare and Social Security reductions , which are going to have to happen . </s>
We are stuck and we are heading toward a national disaster . So the first thing we need to do is get out of the system where we’re stuck in these party ruts . The University of Maryland had a very interesting study where they took Tea Party people , they took liberals , and they said , “Here’s our budget problem , you deal with it.” And the Tea Party people acknowledged that they had to raise taxes , the people on the far left acknowledged some spending had to be cut . </s>
They all could do it . But the two-party system can’t do it . </s>
The second thing we have to do is mobilize independence . We probably need a third party , but we certainly need a de- alignment , we need more movements to come in and affect the parties so people are less hewn to these tribal parties and that’s what the parties have become , they’ve become tribes , almost ethnic tribes . They are no longer the normal political groupings that they were 20 or 30 years ago . They’ve become tribes where your honor is attached to your tribe and any compromise seems like a sign of shame and dishonor and therefore they’re not willing to do it . So we need to get more movements involved , take up the two parties . </s>
And then finally we need a philosophy , we’ve got two parties in this country , but we’ve got three movements . The first movement is a liberal movement that believes in using government to enhance equality . </s>
The second movement is a conservative movement that believes in limited government to enhance freedom . But starting at the foundation of our Republic there was a movement starting with Alexander Hamilton going up to Abraham Lincoln going up to Teddy Roosevelt which believed in limited but energetic government to enhance social mobility , to give people the tools to compete . </s>
This is not big government , it’s not little government , it’s energetic government to give people the tools to thrive in a capitalist economy . That centrist movement is completely unrepresented by the two parties and yet it’s where the largest percentage of Americans are . So if you think , if you take a look at the fiscal situation , if you take a look at some of these big issues and you can see our current two-party system leading to a solution in the near term , you can vote for those guys , but if you can’t see a plausible way out of our problems I suggest you vote for us , thank you . Our motion at this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate , `` The two-party system is making America ungovernable , '' and here to argue against the motion , Zev Chafets , a columnist , the author of 12 books , the founding editor of The Jerusalem Report . We met when you were working for five years in Jerusalem as the government spokesman for Israel , and interesting to note , we’re talking about two-party system , Israel has proportional representation , which at this point has how many parties represented in Parliament ? </s>
Fourteen . And how’s that working out ? Great . Ladies and gentleman , Zev Chafets . </s>
I 'd like to begin by quoting something that I saw in the press just the other day , `` Things have n't been moving in Washington , a young Democratic president with an overwhelmingly Democratic Congress ca n't get much of anything passed except for defense and appropriations , which certainly does n't add up to dynamism , a sense of delusion has set in among friends as well as foes . '' That , from Time Magazine , September 7th , 1962 , and the young president they 're talking about is John F. Kennedy . And the point that I 'd like to begin with is that people always say and have always said that America is ungovernable and that these are times as Arianna put it which are extraordinary , different than other times , and require extraordinary and brand new solutions . </s>
But America has always been in unusual times . That 's how it always seems to people when they 're alive , that they 're living in unprecedented times . In the 1920s , America confronted Prohibition which made it seem that the country was ungovernable and also , you know , no place to get a drink . In the 1930s , there was a depression in this country which was far worse than the economic situation today obviously . In the 1940s , America was able to mobilize itself to go to war against Nazi Germany and Japan even though there was a strong sentiment in this country not to go to war , an America First Sentiment , which was overcome . </s>
In the 1950s , we all -- those of us who are old enough to remember , used to hide under our desks in the nuclear drills because we were sure that we were going to get bombed by the Russians . But , in the event , America won the Cold War . In the 1960s , the halcyon days of our youth -- my team anyway -- -- we not only were living in an ungovernable society , but we were contributing to it , and happily . </s>
The 1970s were Watergate , a disaster . It was the end of American democracy . The president was forced to step down , never happened before . Somehow the country survived those extraordinary times . </s>
And what brought it through each time was the two-party system , which is a stable and consistent system in this country . It’s what provides stability for the United States , politically speaking . The 1980s -- anybody -- some of you remember the 1980s , it looks like . That was the decade that Japan was going to take over and dwarf the American economy , something like the Chinese . And , by the way , the Japanese growth national product per capita is less than America’s today . </s>
And then , of course , we’re living in New York , the ungovernable city , as it was called by Nathan Glazer in 1961 , and as it was referred to by others before Rudy Giuliani became mayor . And if you look out the window , those of you who came here today , you don’t see an ungovernable city . You see a well governed city , both under Giuliani and also under Bloomberg . This was a miracle , but here we are . The American system is a resilient system . </s>
And the notion that this country’s ungovernable is a media trope . It’s not true . </s>
It hasn’t been true . I can prove it to you , if you want , with statistics . The World -- is it the World Bank ? I’m not too good at my notes here . </s>
Because they’re in Hebrew and who can read -- You know , seriously , I’m reading backwards . It’s not funny . I had some -- actually , I did have some great statistics . </s>
I thought I was going to impress David Brooks with them , but you’ll have to take my -- oh , here it is . </s>
Okay , the World Bank index -- it has a thing called the Index of Governability , which is so handy for a debate like this . </s>
And I just looked it up . You know , why argue when you can have fact-based , evidence-based arguements . All right . The World Bank takes into account one , two , three , four , five metrics . Accountability and voice , which goes to what Arianna was discussing , effectiveness of the government , the quality of regulation , the rule of law , and the control of corruption -- in all of those indices , the United States scored above the 90th percentile in the world , which is an “A , ” even at NYU . </s>
And only in public stability , which is a function of terrorism , does it get a “B.” In other words , the American system is a -- if you say compared to what ? Compared to utopia , it’s a replaceable system . </s>
If you compare it to the rest of the systems of the world , it’s a pretty good system . And , as P.J . said , it’s also the system that fits this country . It was built for this country . </s>
And it has lasted a very long time . </s>
Back in the day , there was a columnist that we grew up on , Walter Lippmann . And here’s what he wrote , and I like to close with it . This is about force of representation , proportional voting , but it stands for the system in general . He said that “the objection that popular government can not be conducted without the two-party system is , I believe , refuted by the experience of Europe.” </s>
“If I had to choose between a congressional caucus and a coalition ministry , I should not have to hesitate very long.” That was written in 1914 , the year that World War I began inexplicably . </s>
And I would say that if you look at that system , the European system and the American system , which are the only two real Democratic systems in the world , the American system has done pretty well in the last 80 years . And I think it 's a -- Thank you , Zev Chafets . </s>
Your time is up . Thank you . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . We 'll be right back . </s>
We are back at this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . Our motion is “The two-party system is making America ungovernable.” We have to teams of two members each . Arianna Huffington and David Brooks are arguing for the motion . And arguing against , we have P.J . O'Rourke and Zev Chafets . </s>
The team arguing for the motion has been arguing that we are stuck in , as they have put it , an obsolete prism of right and left . And the team arguing has been saying , well , actually , we 've been stuck before in our long history . And we had a two-party system , and we worked through those crises , and the crises we 're facing now are no more daunting relative to the system than they have been in the past . And we 'll get through again . </s>
I want to put to P.J . O'Rourke -- I do n't know if you 're a founding father kind of guy -- but your opponents have quoted John Adams as saying he dreaded the thought of the body politic dividing into a two-party system . And they 're arguing that there 's no room for many voices when the structure is right and left . Can you take on that argument ? </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Well , Washington went further than that . I have his quote around here someplace , written also in Hebrew . </s>
But Washington said that the -- </s>
I wrote -- I write the quotes for both of us . P.J . O’Rourke : Yeah , yeah . Washington warned against the spirit of party , period . He did n't go so far as to just worry about two . He worried about the system of party absolutely . </s>
And I would say that Americans have taken that to heart , that while there are core Democratic and Republican supporters , and while they probably have more influence over our political system than they ought to , that Americans themselves have always been a bit dubious about both of the major political tendencies . And there is no golden period that we can go back to in American history to find , you know , some sort of political system that would be better for us . </s>
The original divide between Jeffersonian Democrats and the Federalists , the Jeffersonian Democrats were an unholy alliance of New York demagogues -- New York demagogues , who would imagine ? -- New York demagogues who favored the French revolution and all the fun they were having in France and Southern slave owners who favored states ' rights . Meanwhile , the supposedly more respectable Federalists were the authors of the alien -- naturalization alien and sedition acts and the first major political witch hunt in the United States . I think Americans have always been quite aware that both parties stink . </s>
Let me bring in Arianna Huffington to pick up on it . You know , P.J. , I would argue that if we really had -- believed what you believe now throughout the course of American history , we would never have made any moves towards a more perfect union because when we had slavery , you would say , oh , it 's as good as it gets . When women did n't have the vote , you would say , well , you know , it could have been worse . </s>
When we did n't have -- when African-Americans could not vote , you would say , well , you know , just think of it . In other countries , it 's just infinitely worse , and the World Bank probably would have given us an “A” rating . But -- That World Bank “A” rating really worries me . </s>
It must have been the same kind of credit -- credit rating agencies that were giving junk bonds AAA ratings . So , you know , the idea that we 're not living through unprecedented times , you know , is an unbelievably elitist idea that stems -- P.J . O’Rourke : But you see , Arianna -- No , no . Let me just finish . </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Okay . Because this is like from people who are comfortable like we are privileged to be , those of us here on the stage . But just look at what 's happening . </s>
A hundred million Americans right now are worse off than their parents were -- So you 're saying , Arianna , we are in an un-govern -- a situation that reflects un- governability . And also that throughout our history , we 've always aimed to do better . We believe that we can do better . Zev Chafets , are we -- are we in the mess -- the mess of absolute gridlock that I think is being described by your opponent ? </s>
Well , I think that Arianna put it very -- very well . There was a time when there was slavery . And there was a time when women could n't vote . And there was a time when African-Americans could n't -- when African-Americans could n't vote . And all those things no longer are the case . </s>
They all changed . And they all changed under the two- party system , which is the subject that we 're debating tonight . The fact that there are imperfections in America is obvious . </s>
And the fact that there are people in America who are suffering is a constant . So , David Brooks , why is it different this time ? Because it was n't always thus . If you go back to , say , 30 years ago , and you look at the two parties . </s>
In the first place , the two parties overlapped in Congress . Now they do not . There 's no common ground between them . </s>
In the second place , if you look at the things they were able to do , like tax reform in 1986 , you had a whole series of bipartisan agreements . If you cover Congress the way I do , you had , in those days , a whole series of personal relationships . That simply does n't exist . And that 's what -- -- there was something of a golden era , a silver area . </s>
No . There was a period of constructive competition . They fought . </s>
Aaron Burr killed Alexander Hamilton . I would write that as highly polarizing . </s>
But they fought to balance each other 's weaknesses . And now they do n't -- they do n't -- they fight to stagnate . P.J . P.J . O'Rourke . P.J . O’Rourke : I think this is normal -- it 's a normal sine wave in American politics . </s>
After all the 1930s , the New Deal was not exactly a period of huge bipartisanship in them . Bipartisan ideal is always a little worrisome to me . I consider actually the two most dangerous words in Washington to be “bipartisan consensus.” </s>
It 's kind of like when my wife and my doctor and my lawyer all agree that I need help . </s>
I just -- it just -- it concerns me a little bit . But finally where I come apart from -- I 'm glad to sit here and criticize the two-party system . </s>
I do n't have that much good to say about it . The alternative . What is the alternative ? </s>
My biggest concern is that in a multiparty system , it leads to power in small screwy ideology . arguing that , you think that the system is making America ungovernable . </s>
Are you arguing for a better-functioning two-party system , or are you arguing for a multiparty system ? Well , we are arguing for something that will shake up the current dysfunctional system . P.J . O’Rourke : But what ? </s>
But what ? </s>
I do n't want the garden gnome party holding the balance of power . Arianna Huffington . P.J . O’Rourke : Subsidized garden gnomes everywhere . </s>
Let Arianna have the mic . </s>
I thought that was Michael Dukakis . For the record that was David Brooks . </s>
Yeah . Your notes are in Hebrew and mine are in Greek so we all have a problem . But the truth of the moment is that as an immigrant to this country who has lived the American dream . </s>
I 'm fully aware of the fact that the American dream is dying for millions of Americans . And I have two daughters in college . And a growing number of their friends are graduating from college , and they ca n't get jobs . We have 26 million Americans at the moment who are either unemployed or underemployed . And we do n't have any plan that the two parties seem to be capable of , of how to bring jobs about . </s>
So there is a huge dysfunctionality . And the results are really incredibly profound . I mean , they are changing the nature of this country . Upward mobility has been at the heart of the American dream . Now we are number ten when it comes to upward mobility . </s>
We are behind France and Germany . Excuse me , but being behind France in upward mobility is like France being behind us in croissants and afternoon sex . But to P.J . 's point about this it’s just your dumb kids . Why is that about the two-party system and not about everything else ? </s>
Well , the idea that it’s dumb kids that are the problem is just charming P.J . I mean , whatever P.J . says , he 's charming because he 's funny . But it 's not true . And that 's our debate for this evening . Zev Chafets , come on in . </s>
Well , I would say not true is -- that 's pretty definitive . The notion of being in a debate with Arianna Huffington arguing that America has lost its ability to have upward mobility is a startling experience . And I want to say something about David 's notion about bipartisanship . Two things quickly , first of all , polarization is a good thing , not a bad thing . In countries where you do n't have polarized political debate , you have no debate . </s>
Severity does not equal democracy . And in the many countries that I 've visited , and you 've all visited and been to and I’m sure many of you where you haven’t heard harsh debate , you have been in the countries that are being ruled , not in Democratic ways and societies that are open . And the other thing about this golden age of advise and consent when all the Congressmen got together , the Senators got together and had cocktails and so on , and there’s no bipartisanship anymore , I just want to say the following words , No Child Left Behind which was passed in a bipartisan way , the Medicaid prescription -- Medicare prescription , the tax cuts , the Bush tax cuts , the Iraq War which like it or not was a bipartisan affair , the TARP stuff , the healthcare bill which was passed in a – a mono- partisan way -- All right , let me -- -- all of these things have been passed in the last 10 years . </s>
First , on the civility point , screw off , you fat bastard . </s>
Let’s go , let’s go ! No , I believe in conflict , I’m a columnist , conflict is fine with me . And I’m fine with that as long as it’s constructive . </s>
The problem is we have parties that don’t represent the country . We now have , here’s a fact from Morris Fiorina , Stanford political scientist , more people own ferrets than watch Fox News . And so , but we have a party -- P.J . O’Rourke : Is n't there a lot of overlap ? That 's a good point , yeah . Glenn Beck’s ferret is loose . </s>
But we have a party that’s sort of dictated by that small group , and in the Democratic party we have a party dictated by the public sector employee unions . And you’ve got vast numbers of people whose views are not basically represented , so the country is still a bell curve country , and the rest of the -- and the two-party system is not . And therefore you don’t have -- Just tell us what you mean by bell curve ? </s>
A bell curve is like this , most people in the middle . </s>
And so you don’t have constructive competition , which would be us talking and then reaching an agreement after an hour , you just have , eh , you guys suck . But , David , can I just say that in the last election the Republicans nominated John McCain , a more reasonable Republican than that would be hard to find . And the Democrats nominated Barack Obama who was the soul of reasonableness , and so much is in favor of civility that he said at my alma mater , the University of Michigan , “If you are people who listen to Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck , then read some articles on the Huffington Post.” That 's what you have . Those are the two leaders of the major parties at least until the next election . </s>
I do n't think that you can make the case that these are extremists who do n't talk to one another or who are civil with one another . Compare pre-nomination John McCain to post-nomination John McCain and see what a guy has to do to get elected . Arianna Huffington , if you -- you said that democracy can not be a spectator sport . </s>
Your opponents are saying that Americans by nature are not ideological . Maybe those two things are not necessarily in conflict with each other , but do you take their point that for the most part , Americans are n't that into politics and therefore that makes the parties rather irrelevant ? </s>
I think Americans do n't believe that our current -- Could I just ask you just to move a little closer to your mic . Thank you . Oh , sorry . </s>
Americans do n't believe that our current political system is working . That 's why you have 37 percent of Americans who are registered as independents because they do n't believe our current two-party system is delivering what the country needs . </s>
And increasingly young people who really do want to find solutions to our problems are choosing civic engagement instead of political engagement . Who have long waiting lists for people to join teach for America , so it 's not as if they 've given up on making the world better . </s>
I mean , P.J . and Zev may have given up on making the world better but -- -- young people have n't , they just do n't see the political route through the two-party system as the way to make the world better , but if we give up on making the world better then we might as well give up on everything . You know , I mean , I think in the end Churchill was right , he said Americans can be counted to do the right thing after they have exhausted all other possibility . </s>
And the two-party system is one of the other possibilities we have now exhausted . P.J . O'Rourke . P.J . O’Rourke : I do n't at all feel fatalist about this . And I do n't feel like standing pat . </s>
I think we are in the middle of a huge fight . I think Tea Party is a very good example . I keep waiting for the Democratic party to have the equivalent . I hope that it will . </s>
I think we 're in the midst of a political realignment going on in the United States . </s>
I think our opponents mistake a current situation for a permanent situation . </s>
I think that the American politics goes through phases like this , and you know people say , “Oh , it 's more polarized now than it 's ever been , ” and I 'm going , like the 60s ? That wasn’t polarized ? You know , the 1860s , that wasn’t polarized ? So , are you saying , P.J. , we may be temporarily ungovernable ? </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Yeah , I mean , we’re temporarily badly governed . You know , and I think that that happens a lot , and I think that , you know -- this budget crisis will not go away . Sooner or later , these dumb SOBs down in Washington are going to have to face up to this fact . And , you know , if the pass is anything to go by , they will . </s>
I still keep waiting for hearing what is the alternative to the system that we have now . </s>
I’m open to the idea that there might be an alternative , but I’m not hearing any alternative . I’m hearing merely a criticism of the system that we’ve got now . Well , that’s all they actually need to prove . </s>
Exactly . P.J . O’Rourke : Well fine -- </s>
But it does raise the point… It’s a very , very important point that I think the audience will want to hear from you , Arianna . As opposed to what ? </s>
Well , first of all , let me just say that the motion is “The two-party system is making American ungovernable.” And I hope you’ve all heard our opponents make our case again and again and again . In fact , P.J . just said , it’s not good right now , but it doesn’t mean it’s not going to get better . </s>
Absolutely . All we are saying is that we need to take steps to make it better . </s>
We can’t just wait by the sidelines and expect it to get better . And the fastest way to make it better is to shake up a dysfunctional and stagnant two- party system . That’s all we have to prove . But how ? </s>
That’s all we are arguing . Well , the primary way is to allow more competition . All of us believe in competition , right ? </s>
It’s the essence of a private enterprise , freedom- based system . We believe in competition in everything except politics . When it comes to politics , you’ve got to pick your party and run with your party , and actually espouse whatever the party stands for at that particular moment . One election cycle , it may be abortion or no abortion -- the social issues , this election cycle , and it’s around issues that have to do with the shrinking government on the Republican side . So , that’s not the way to fundamentally change the conditions we are all living under . </s>
Zev Chafets or P.J. , if you are ready to move on , I can go to the audience for questions , but if you’d like to respond ? P.J . O’Rourke : I’m still not hearing -- I don’t -- I’m with P.J . We’re talking about a two-party system in an actual world , or a different political system in an actual world . The two-party system is a very long-standing -- and by the way , it has plenty of room for Independents , which are part of the system , and also for third-party candidates , which are a function of every election , whether it’s Ross Perot or whether it’s Pat Buchanan , or you can’t name an election -- or Henry Wallace , or George Wallace or -- you can’t name an election that hasn’t had a third-party candidate or more -- P.J . O’Rourke : Or usually a big nut . The fact that people don’t want to vote for them is not the same thing as saying that they don’t exist . </s>
And I think that we have to -- since we’re talking about reality and not utopia , I think we have to ask ourselves , who , on this stage , the four of us -- the three of you are all brilliant , and John , of course , is also . </s>
If the five of us , and I’m just old -- I have more age . I’m older than P.J . by a couple of months , so I have seniority . </s>
But if the five of us had to sit down and devise a better political system , even with the wizards on this panel , I don’t think we would be able to do it . And even if the whole audience participated , we probably might not get there . We have a political -- there is a political system in this country , and thank God there is . It provides stability , and it’s grown organically . P.J . O’Rourke : It’s grown organically over the course of 235 years – </s>
Okay , you’ve had a good run . Let’s let David Brooks -- Speaking of this long duration , you know , I grew up here at NYU . I went to the University of Chicago , a Baptist school where atheist professors teach Jewish students Saint Thomas Aquinas . </s>
I’m used to long historical visions , and the idea that “Oh , it’s sort of always been like this , ” it’s just not true . Let’s take my pet issue , the deficit . Every generation has an incentive to pass debt off on the future generations , but no generation until the current one has done it because the political system -- P.J . O’Rourke : Finally , our dream come true . </s>
-- was able to mobilize and basically exercise some self control and cut deals . Ronald Reagan did the biggest tax increase in American history because the political system then basically worked . The parties are now different than they were then . All right , we’re going to go to some audience questions when we come back . </s>
We are back . This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S . That didn’t last long . Wouldn’t it be great if commercials really worked that way ? </s>
TiVo for life . We are back . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. Our motion is “The two-party system is making America ungovernable.” We have two teans of two debaters each trying to change your minds . </s>
And I 'd like to go now to the audience for some questions . And gentleman with the glasses and neck tie . A mic will come to you . And if you could stand up just so that the camera can find you . And if you can keep it terse and questioning . </s>
Thank you very much . This is terrific . My question is to the panelists in favor of the resolution . </s>
And it 's at the theme that you were just discussing . Given the fact that the two-party system happened by itself , bottom up , organically , to use P.J . 's word , how exactly would you get rid of it , or perhaps worse , what would you impose and in what way ? </s>
David Brooks . First , I 'm not necessarily for realignment , but de-alignment . We 're seeing all sorts of social movements that are growing up organically like the Tea party , like the Obama movement , like Move On . I 'd like to see a lot more of those movements in order to loosen up the parties . </s>
And the second thing , I do think there has been an historical tradition , which I talked about , from Hamilton to Lincoln and maybe to moderate Republicans and moderate Democrats today , the very few that exist . That tradition is unrepresented by our politics . And I think that long American historic tradition deserves a voice . So those would be two things I 'd change . </s>
And I would add that -- Arianna Huffington . -- movement politics really leads us to what I call Hope 2.0 . You know , if Obama was about hope , which is just basically hope being channeled to one of the two parties . Hope 2.0 is about hope being channeled to multiple movements , a community solution , people all around the country unleashing an enormous amount of creativity and ingenuity around finding solutions at the local level . </s>
We in the media are doing a lousy job of putting a spotlight on what is working . We need to do a much better job . We need to help them scale up . </s>
And this is really part of what we are talking about . Arianna , do n't you feel that the parties actually are responsive to movements , or they 're affected by them ultimately will co-op them ? </s>
No , I think -- Be shaped by them ? I think to a large extent the parties use movements during election times . I mean , look at the Obama movement . </s>
Once Obama was in the White House , he basically disappeared . They are now trying to reconstitute it because he is beginning to run for the election . </s>
That 's not what makes a thriving movement . </s>
A movement is something which organically continues to grow through elections and beyond them . And that 's what we need more of . People do not trust establishments . I mean , look at the tea party movement . </s>
It 's fundamentally anti-establishment . Look at what 's happening among young people on the Democrat side , fundamentally anti- establishment . The numbers of mistrust when it comes to our national institutions has skyrocketed . We need to address that . Otherwise we are becoming an increasingly dysfunctional society . </s>
Zev Chafets , your opponent . Well , first of all , I want to take issue with the characterization of the Obama movement . </s>
Obama was the nominee of the Democratic party . </s>
He was n't a movement candidate . He was a candidate of one of the two major parties . Had he been only a movement candidate , he would have gotten three percent of the vote or five percent of the vote or whatever movement candidates get . </s>
But he went through the system , and he 's a part of the system . As far as the notion of young people speaking their minds and getting so much resistance from behind . </s>
We 're talk -- that 's not a good idea , Arianna . Really , it 's not . It 's great for everybody to participate . And I 'm glad that there 's an Internet and all of the cool stuff that we 've got these days in participatory Facebook and all the rest of it . But since everybody 's quoting the founding fathers , John Adams also said that political parties are there to govern passion . </s>
And something needs to govern the un-channeled passions of all of the marvelous passion that kids have and young people have and disaffected people have and anti-establishmentarian people have , and they all can exist within the framework of the two-party system as they have ever since 1865 , whenever the Civil War ended , in my opinion . All right . Let 's go to another question . </s>
Right in the center . It might help -- yes . You 're - - you 're the only one with your hand up in the front row . And a mic is going to come down this way to you . </s>
And if you do n't mind standing again . I know you 're right in front . </s>
With the growth of social media and the 24/7 news cycle , what role do you see the media playing in helping reinforce the current two-party system or changing it for the future ? </s>
Can I ask you what you think the media 's role is so far in that regard ? Do you think it 's ossifying the system ; it 's keeping it in place or -- is that somewhat of your lament ? I think it 's keeping it in place . </s>
All right . So what you 're really asking is can that change , I think . Yes . Arianna Huffington , sounds like a . </s>
Yeah , I completely agree with you . And if you look , for example , at the way the media describes our political problems , it’s reflexively through that prism of right versus left . I mean , I mentioned Afghanistan in my opening statement , Wall Street reform , unemployment . </s>
Why is it left wing to care about helping people get jobs ? </s>
And yet that 's how it 's portrayed in the media . But if you look at how the discussion is , say , on social media , it 's very different . Does not accept those very stale distinctions . So we have a responsibility , those of us in the media and everybody else , to participate in that and change it . </s>
And increasingly , more and more , people are participating , and self- expression has become a kind of form of self-fulfillment . More people are participating , uploading videos . We saw it not just here . We saw it in what happened in Egypt recently . We saw a phenomenal outpouring of something which I suppose you might regard dangerous because it 's leading to uncontrollable passions . </s>
But it 's also leading to freedom , liberation and other things that uncontrollable passions provide . You need to see the expressions on the faces over there . </s>
very briefly , because I think we know where you 're going . The reason that the social media was necessary in Egypt , because it was a one-party state . It 's not a two-party state . </s>
That 's the whole point of this . Everything -- P.J . O’Rourke : -- two-party state . -- within the two-party system . You do n't need -- you do n't need a mob of Facebook- inspired Democrats if you have the ability to nominate candidates then vote for them . </s>
And then -- Well , first of all , the fact that you are calling it a mob shows what respect you have for them . </s>
The other thing is that -- </s>
What did you think they were ? I mean , what are they ? Were they -- Why is it a mob ? </s>
Why are people who are organizing on Facebook or through Twitter in order to overthrow an oppressive regime a mob ? Ask Lara Logan . All right . </s>
Let 's -- let 's move on . Gentleman , if you can stand up . Yeah , I think one of the reasons the country was more governable in the past , one of the reasons we had overlap between the parties , which I think was mentioned , is that we had much more of a common narrative in the past . </s>
The parties agreed more on what the facts were and then disagreed on their interpretations of them . So you could have , as P.J . would say , the stupid and the silly arguments for the -- But what era are you talking about , because there were plenty of times when they did n't -- Up until recently . Today , we have a greater bifurcation in the news than we 've ever had . </s>
We have FOX on one side , we have MSNBC on the other . Okay . So what would your question be ? Perhaps the problem here is that the country may be ungovernable , but it 's not the two- party system that 's the problem . Rather , the problem is the way information now flows through the country and the way we end up with essentially tribes around facts as opposed to simply tribes around interpretation . </s>
P.J . O'Rourke in response . P.J . O’Rourke : bifurcation you 're talking about . </s>
I think there is a tendency to take the period from about the end of the Korean War through , say , Johnson 's Great Society , as being somehow normative in American history . </s>
It is not . The two political parties were , of course , violently polarized in the civil war , quite polarized after the Civil War , extremely polarized during the 1920s , extremely polarized during the -- during the 1930s . They are extremely polarized right now . I would argue that polarization is more normal than not . </s>
As far as there being some sort of media voice of common wisdom and some sort of -- some sort of objectivity in the media , that was like a sort of little false advertising campaign of the New York Times over the course of about one decade , you know ? American newspapers have traditionally been just hysterically partisan . I mean , if you go back through the history of the American press , it has almost entirely been advocating -- and usually in the loosest and most irresponsible way , one particular -- So P.J. , let me put your central point to the other side . You 're saying that polarization is the norm most of the time . </s>
David Brooks . Fighting is the norm . </s>
Polarization like we 've seen is not the norm . This is actually statistically demonstrable . Political scientists take a look at how many votes cross party lines , how many times in each Congress people actually reach bipartisan deals . And the number now is at all time lows , it 's cycled through history , but it’s never been like this . </s>
People fought Lyndon Johnson in the '60s , fought -- but Lyndon Johnson was able to fashion coalitions . Henry Clay , people then fought , they were able to fashion coalitions . The problem is not that they were fighting . I’m all for fighting , the problem is that each party has become more rigid in my own lifetime of covering this stuff . </s>
When I came to Washington in the early '80s I could go to back benchers like Jack Kemp or Newt Gingrich on the Republican side , they had all these weird ideas they were trying to push on leadership . That doesn’t happen , the leaders control everything now . The nature of the parties has changed . This time is different . </s>
Yes . Okay , question , ma’am , with the scarf , and the mic is coming to your left side . </s>
One of the reasons that the parties seem to have so much more power now is the control of the money . And even though there have been attempts to do campaign finance reform we seem to be moving even further away from that goal rather than to trying to diffuse some of that . How do you respond to that and is that affecting our two-party system today ? </s>
Arianna ? You write about this a lot . Absolutely , I think that’s a very important point and especially with the citizens ' united decision . As you said we see the stronghold of money on our political system , the power of special interest , the fact that we have dozens of lobbyists per member of Congress , the fact that even when good legislation is passed it’s undermined at the committee stage . All those things have made us ungovernable , because even when -- and we have mining reform for example , then you go back and you look at how it was all watered down to the point where the Virginia mining disaster could happen . </s>
Even when you have regulators living inside Lehman Brothers or Fannie and Freddie , they were not able to prevent the regulator recapture that allowed the financial meltdown to happen . </s>
I mean we have lost trillions in private wealth . </s>
We have the greatest increase in poverty in the suburbs at the moment . We are becoming a third world country and if we don’t pay attention now , if we don’t do something where they stand to course correct then it’s going to be too late . </s>
And that’s why this is the time to sound the alarm , recognize it to have become ungovernable and change the system . </s>
All right , more questions from the audience when we come back . You know what would actually help me come back is if I could have one of those rounds of applause that you hear when -- thank you . We are back with this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate , I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . Our motion is `` The two-party system is making America ungovernable . '' </s>
Arguing for the motion we have Arianna Huffington and David Brooks . Arguing against , Zev Chafets and P.J . O'Rourke , and going to a question from the audience , gentleman with the eyeglasses . And I again want to urge you because we 're starting to stray a little bit to make these questions that are terse and that are related to the topic please , so you 're first . </s>
Okay . So responding to Mr. Chafets , the United States is above the 90th percentile in terms of governance compared to the entire world but that 's a pretty low bar to set for the world 's richest and most powerful country . </s>
But my question is for the side in favor of it , in my native Canada there is about 80,000 people for every member of Parliament . And we have a chance to meet them much more than here where there 's about 800,000 people for every member or member of the House , and I 'm wondering if it 's -- do you think that it 's a problem with the two-party system or is the country just too large to be governed ? There are many multiparty countries in Northern Europe that are much better governed than us but they 're smaller . </s>
I guess I would say -- </s>
David Brooks . </s>
- I was born in Canada , bula bula . You know , I 'm actually not sure that 's it because members of Congress fly home every weekend . That 's one of the reasons their lives are so miserable and they hold town meetings . And a lot of places -- I meant the flight , not the getting there -- they hold town meetings and if they can get 30 or 50 people to show up they 're happy , they love to meet people , they spend a lot of time meeting people . And as I said they have this you and I need food and water , they just need social love , that 's what they need . </s>
And so I do n't think that 's it . </s>
I do n't think it 's when they go home that the problem is , I think it 's when they come to Washington and are surrounded by a psychological vortex . I just wanted to make that explicit . I think the psychology within the parties has changed -- And , P.J. , I think you 're almost arguing that the bluntness of -- by design of a large system with two parties that you feel have a lot of ideological overlap is perfect for a gigantic country like this one . </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Well , I think that it is because I think the intrusion of third parties and other interests just has a tendency to act as a sort of spoiler situation , basically throwing the race to George W. Bush instead of to Al Gore who would have been such a wonderful president . </s>
Anyway , you know , that’s another matter . Yeah , I do think it suits us . </s>
You know , the problem , of course , is when we face the kind of crisis like we have at the moment that is both extremely pressing and yet , unlike Pearl Harbor , is not perfectly immediate . </s>
Our system is extremely slow to respond . Do we want to live in a country with a political system that is a little too slow to respond , or do we want to live in one of those countries where the political system is a little too quick to respond ? I pick slowness , myself . Would you like to respond , Arianna Huffington ? Well , because it depends on the kind of problems we are facing . </s>
And if we are really willing to recognize the problems that we are facing now and how serious they are , when it comes to unemployment , when it comes to foreclosures , when it comes to bankruptcies , when it comes to the fact that growing numbers of kids can’t afford college , and if they graduated from college can’t get jobs . I mean , these are serious problems . And they are also leading to a kind of political instability and a kind of demonizing our opponents , which always happens during times of deep economic anxiety , when it was the 1880s when we were expelling Chinese workers , or the 1930s when we were expelling Hispanic workers who were actually American citizens . You see what the problems are when we are not taking steps to deal with them in a timely manner . </s>
Okay , I’m going to go to another question . And I’m raising my hand to my face because I have difficulty seeing farther up . </s>
There’s a woman in a blue top . Hi . I think this debate is great , but I think one of the concerns that a lot of people have is how do you shift away from a two-party system . Basically , how do you cope with the “Nader effect” where the balance becomes shift too far in one direction as you’re trying to divide the parties ? 19:59:24 . </s>
Can you rephrase that in a way that would help people , when they hear the answers , settle their mind on our motion ? Because I think you can . I’m sorry . I guess , basically , I’m more concerned with the details of how , what type of plan do we implement to move away from the two-party -- So you’re asking what this side is asking when they are saying “as opposed to what ? ” </s>
Is that what you’re asking ? I’m basically just trying to figure out , how do we move away from the two-party system ? </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Yeah , as opposed to what ? A three-party system ? A four-party system ? A 12-party system ? Okay , but I’m sure -- </s>
How do we divide the parties into the different groups without shifting power too far in one direction -- </s>
Do you want to take that question on ? Yeah , Arianna or David ? Yeah , I would say that even though we don’t have to take that question in doing the debate , we are very willing to take that question on . And there are many voting measures that could be put in place if the two-party system did not have a stronghold on the current electoral system that would make it possible , for example . </s>
If you voted for Ralph Nader , and if Ralph Nader did not win , for your vote to go to your second choice . </s>
I mean , that is a completely plausible system that can be implemented immediately if the two parties did not prevent it from being implemented . David Brooks . -- just another role is non-party primaries . I mean , if you look at the most disaffected people , they’re not actually where Nader is or not where Libertarians are . They’re in the middle 37 percent of the country basically feels disaffected . </s>
But they have no candidates to vote for in general elections because they’re just not offered them . And if you had non-party primaries , you’d have a better shot they’d have a voice . And that’s a point that I’d brought to you before from their argument that you didn’t really respond to is that they’re talking about the system as it is , really leaving people with such distasteful choices that they don’t have choices , and that that’s a lot of people , and that that’s what they feel is a major flaw in a democracy . Zev Chafets ? I confess that I don’t understand the premise or the question . </s>
That there’s a lot of people who don’t feel they’re represented by these parties . </s>
Yeah , and in multi-party systems , there are many people who also don’t feel that they’re representing by any of the parties . And I , having lived in a country that has 14 parties , I can tell you that I did n't find any that represented me . That 's an inherent problem of democracy . If you have a party that fits the taste of every person or every group of people , you 'll have hundreds or a multiplicity of parties that makes it impossible to govern . </s>
And if you have any system , whether it 's a two-party system or a proportional representational system or a different kind of parliamentary system , I assure you -- and I 've lived through this . I 'm telling you from personal experience -- that professional politicians will always find a way to game whatever reform you make in the electoral system because they 're better at it than you are and I am . That 's what they do for a living . </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Exactly . And therefore I think that if you have something that is open to everyone , anybody can vote in this country . </s>
Anybody can join a party in this country . Anybody could run for office in this country . That 's great . </s>
If , as P.J . says , many people are n't interested , then they 're not interested . But you ca n't force anybody -- the only place I know where people are forced to vote is in North Vietnam , I mean North Korea . Australia . Australia ? </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : And if you get attention of one of the mics , thanks . At NYU , we have the privilege to have some very good faculty , including Professor Steven J. Brams , who talks about approval voting , which is one of the systems they talked about , where if your first choice does n't get elected , your voice goes to your second choice and down the line . </s>
It produces more democratic outcomes and would reduce polarity in the parties . My question is , why would this be a negative thing to institute ? Why would making elections more accessible to people , you know , things like approval voting or letting people vote electronically be a bad thing ? </s>
And if there are other measures , what is a good way to explore them to bring them into the American system to reform elections -- </s>
P.J . P.J . O'Rourke ? </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : I do n't have any inherent objection to this . I think it 's interesting that we 're hearing the solutions to the problem posited here more from the audience than from the other side . </s>
But one of the beauties of America 's federalist system , of our highly decentralized system with all sorts of -- states are essentially in charge of voting laws as long as they do n't forbid people from voting because they belong to a category such as women or such as blacks . They actually -- states have enormous latitude in control of the election laws . And the fact that we have this flexible system would allow us to try things out like that . </s>
Maybe they would work beautifully and would produce the kind of results that you think that they might . Maybe they would produce perverse and bizarre results . And we 'd find out . I 'm thinking your opponents are saying , though , that the system -- that the way the system runs now has such a stranglehold on the way the system runs now that those reforms are unlikely to be put into place . Am I anticipating ? </s>
Well , I mean , let 's take this case right here . David Brooks . We 've got a 5-foot 6-inch Jewish guy who runs this city , Mayor Bloomberg . He thought about running -- P.J . O’Rourke : He 's Jewish ? </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Who knew ? I 'm amazed he 's 5-foot-6 . So he thought about running for president . </s>
And he had some money , I hear . And so he thought , well , you know -- and there were a lot of people who were disaffected . So could I win ? And then he said , well , I could win some states , probably not all of them , but I could win some . </s>
And then it would get thrown into the House of Representatives , a body staffed entirely by Republicans and Democrats . </s>
There 's no way they 're going to vote for me . And so he was dissuaded from running as a third-party candidate by the fact that the two parties have a stranglehold on the presidential process . </s>
And this is bad ? P.J . O’Rourke : Depends on how you feel about Mayor Bloomberg . </s>
One of you guys just said Mayor Bloomberg ran the city well . </s>
I think it was you . I think he did run the -- he does run the city well . P.J . O’Rourke : -- want to let him out of the city . I’ll live here . </s>
He might be a great president , by the way . I have no reason to think that he would n't be . </s>
And I might vote for him . </s>
But the fact that a guy with $ 16 billion ca n't become president of the United States simply by buying the election does not strike me as a flaw in a democratic -- -- raise $ 500 million ? </s>
Yeah . P.J . O’Rourke : No , I think essentially we will -- the problems that our opponents raise are valid problems , and these -- but this is a democracy . And these problems will be answered when we , the demos demand that they be answered . There is no magic trick that we can impose to fix this . </s>
Sir , you are the most aggressive hand-raiser of this evening . So this had better be good . </s>
Passion , Passion . Mr. O'Rourke , you just mentioned actually that you 're getting more responses of how to change things from the audience . I think that was what Arianna was discussing about multiple voices . </s>
So that 's -- P.J . O’Rourke : Okay . </s>
Fair enough . Fair enough . That 's fair and balanced of you . indeed . Indeed . </s>
My question is actually , our founding fathers wanted church and state separated . If I 'm not mistaken , I do n't believe it was until the '50s , until `` In God We Trust '' started getting printed on money . How do you think religion is affecting the two-party system ? P.J . O’Rourke : Ooh . </s>
Ooh , you know ? They want them separated . They did n't want them extinguished , either of the two things in question . </s>
I actually think that religion is a little bit on the decline in terms of its influence . I think it probably reached its peak influence in the United States with the Prohibition , which was not entirely church driven , but there was certainly a very , very strong . </s>
But William Jennings Brian and the Populist party , one of the third parties that some people may be in favor of , was a strongly religious party . He 's the guy that ended up prosecuting the monkey trial on the teachings of Charles Darwin . The strongest religious influence was then . </s>
There was then a resurgence , of course , during the social values debate of the '80s . I would say at the moment , it 's a bit on the decline partly because fundamentalist Protestants have realized that in many ways they have a lot of things in common with at least centrist Democrats in terms of social policy . Certain things they do n't have in common , of course , questions of abortion and so on . But they -- But does this relate to the two-partiness of our system , necessarily ? </s>
P.J . O’Rourke : Yeah . There 's no doubt that religious questions have a greater influence on the Republican party than they do on the Democratic party , leaving Reverend Wright aside . But really , I think it 's a little bit of an issue in decline in the United States -- </s>
All right . P.J . O’Rourke : -- personally . There is a green striped shirt . </s>
And if you could stand up , please . You are all the most qualified people to respond to this . In point of fact , it 's not a two- party system because there are other parties on the voting ballots . But is the problem the media which makes people think it 's only a two-party system ? Can I ask you -- it 's a little bit of a rephrasing of the question we had earlier about the media sort of perpetuating this sense that there are only two parties . </s>
Do you have that sense ? And do you think that 's a problem ? Yes . </s>
It seems like there 's very little coverage of third-party candidates unless they 're eccentric in some respect . And they are . </s>
And they 're always presented as by -- they 're represented by their eccentricities instead of by their -- And what 's lost in that ? -- position . And what 's lost as a result of that ? I do n't know . </s>
Well , what I 'm asking is do you agree with this side that there are voices that are not being heard because of this -- is that a problem for you ? </s>
Absolutely , in the fact that the ballots always have Democrat and Republican first . I think they should be in alphabetical order because the Republicans would change the name of their party in a second and the fact that people run under different parties , but most Americans are not educated -- sorry -- do n't approach the poll I think in a very thoughtful way and realize that they could vote for the same person but under a different party . Strengthen third parties . More money will go to third parties . Okay . </s>
Money follows votes . </s>
Okay . But . I 've got to stop you . But why do n't you take on the question , because it is slightly different . David Brooks . </s>
Well , you know , I do this for a living . And I sometimes go on TV shows , and the TV shows I happen to go on are some of the best on TV , the News Hour with Jim Lehrer , which is much less partisan shouting than most . And yet the shows all of us are on , you are either the Republican seat or the Democratic seat . And I consider myself Hamiltonian , like I 've been saying , which fits very awkwardly with the current Republican party . </s>
And yet that 's my seat . That 's my role . </s>
That 's what I play on TV . And so it 's sometimes frustrating . I can imagine for people further outside one of those parties , it 's frustrating because you 're put into that slot . And I 've been very struck by -- I think when I started doing this , people would say , “Are you conservative or liberal ? ” Now people come up to me , “Are you a Republican or Democrat ? ” </s>
The label Republican or Democrat has sup planted conservative or liberal . It 's not what you believe . It 's what team you 're on . </s>
And that 's part of -- P.J . O’Rourke : -- feel that . I happen to be a Republican , but I am primarily a Libertarian conservative and when I go on shows , not quite the same quality of shows as David goes on -- -- my place -- I 'm on Bill Maher -- my place is there as a sort of a kooky Libertarian conservative , a guy who 's really , really conservative , really , really Republican , but thinks about marijuana , it’s a drug that makes teenage boys drive slow and what’s wrong with that ? </s>
-- and so I think that there are broader categories than merely Democratic and Republican . Okay , and gentleman in the center , if you could stand -- yep , that 's you , thank you . You know , it would seem obviously that the audience by the fact that we’re all here today is very interested in the debate and what the panel has to say . But it would also seem that most Americans are moderate and they don’t think in terms of left or right , but in what affects them . And it doesn’t seem that the two-party system that we have today does reflect what they want as the people . </s>
Okay , so I’m taking that as a comment to this side . P.J . O’Rourke : Except in this one respect – Let’s have Zev take this one . </s>
Let me agree with you first of all that most Americans are not here tonight . P.J . O’Rourke : We can prove that statistically . Statistically , the World Bank . But I do think that statements like the people don’t get what they want , that may be true , I mean you don’t always in life , right ? </s>
But at least there are vehicles , that 's all that a democracy can offer . It can offer ways to express yourself in the media , in new media , old media , on the street corner , in groups , however you want to do it , and politically within organized parties . </s>
Are they the Democrats and the Republicans or are they as you suggest the Republicans have changed their name to triple A so they 'll be first on the ballot , you know , like -- P.J . O’Rourke : I was thinking a-hole , myself . That concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . And here 's where we are . </s>
We are about to hear closing statements from each debater in turn . </s>
Those closing statements will be two minutes each , and remember you voted before the debate and you’re going to be asked to vote again right afterwards , and this is their last chance to change your minds . So on to round three , closing statements , our motion is `` The two-party system is making American ungovernable . '' </s>
Here to speak against the motion , P.J . O'Rourke , political satirist , journalist , and author of 13 books including `` Don’t Vote -- It Just Encourages the Bastards . '' P.J . O’Rourke : Okay , our vague and sloppy political system keeps America away from abstract political theories . </s>
In all 20th century was an experiment in abstract political theory , vigorously applied in places like Italy , Germany , Spain , Russia , China , North Korea , Cuba , also in Rhodesia , and apartheid South Africa , and among some of my loonier friends who joined the weather underground , you know ? Away from abstract political theory is a good place to be . Our compromised and compromising system with its messy conflicts and its fitful bipartisanship , keeps governance close to real life because in reality we all contain within ourselves elements of the Democrat and the Republican . We are conservatives when we catch the kids smoking pot and we 're quite liberal when we catch ourselves doing it . No one ever says “Oh , goody , ” when it 's time to pay taxes and no one ever turns down a government benefit . </s>
Abandoning the two-party system would mean abandoning a great truth , the truth that we 're all of two minds about politics , greater certainty in our political opinions would mean more politics , more arguments , more strife , we do n't need that , we 've got enough , giving up on the lame old political generalities of Democrats and Republicans would make politics more important in America . Now , as a reporter I have spent a lot of time in places where politics are a life or death matter , let 's not go there . Indeed , my closing argument is a simple plea for personal mercy . </s>
I 've been covering American politics for 40 years , two parties is as many as I can stand . </s>
Well , thank you , P.J . O’Rourke . Our motion is “The two-party system is making American ungovernable , ” and here to speak for the motion , Arianna Huffington , president and editor-in-chief of The Huffington Post Media Group . </s>
So , if all you care about here tonight is to make P.J.’s life easier , vote against this motion . If you care about making the life of the country better , vote with us . Basically , the two- party system is like a stale marriage . Democrats and Republicans need something to spice it up . They need to go on craigslist and find a third party . </s>
And if that third party isn’t wearing a shirt , they really should do a background check . Because he might turn out to be a member of Congress , and you don’t want to go there . So , I remember in 2000 I organized a shadow convention . The shadow conventions were intended to address issues that the two political parties were not addressing . And those issues were the growing income inequalities , the failed war on drugs that has put more African Americans in jail than that have jobs at the moment , and also the problem that was addressed here tonight of campaign financial reform and the desperate need to do that . </s>
Since 2000 , all these problems have gotten worse , and they have gotten worse because the two-party system has made this country ungovernable . And unless you give up on the idea of America becoming a more perfect union . Unless you give up on the idea of us being able to really live up to the American dream of our ancestors , then you’ve got to vote with David and me . Thank you , Arianna Huffington . Our motion is “The two-party system is making America ungovernable.” </s>
Here to summarize his position against the motion , Zev Chafets , a columnist , an author of 12 books and founding editor of The Jerusalem Report . Ninety-nine years ago , a guy stood up at a political convention , a third-party convention , and he said , “We stand at Armageddon , and we battle for the Lord.” </s>
That was Teddy Roosevelt . </s>
“Armageddon” was Woodrow Wilson . It’s always Armageddon for people who have that tendency , and it’s good that there are people who think it’s Armageddon because they push . </s>
That’s a good thing . I support that . I’m in favor of it . There’s a place for it in the political parties . But tonight we’re talking about a specific motion , which is that the two-party system is making American ungovernable . </s>
In order for you to vote for that , you have to agree to two things . You have to agree that America is becoming ungovernable , or perhaps it is already , as Arianna said in the beginning , has become ungovernable . I don’t think that that’s the case . </s>
I don’t think that any of you who came here today by car , by bus , by train , by plane , however you got here , travelled through a space which anyone could regard as ungovernable . </s>
American is a highly governed country . </s>
It has flaws , it has problems , it has economic inequalities -- all of these things have existed , and they’ll continue to exist . They’re part of the human condition . America needs to be a more perfect society ; it can’t be a perfect society because no society is perfect . The second proposition that you have to agree to , even if you think that the world and America as you know it is ungovernable -- ungovernable ! -- you have to believe that the reason that it’s ungovernable , that the BP disaster took place and the Virginia mining disaster took place , and all the other disasters took place because of the two-party system . </s>
And I don’t really think that you can make that case . And therefore , I implore you to vote for our side . </s>
Thank you , Zev Chafets . </s>
Our motion , “The two-party system is making America ungovernable , ” and here to summarize his position in favor of this motion , David Brooks , The New York Times op/ed columnist , commentator on the NewsHour , and coming out in a matter of weeks with a new book called “The Social Animal.” Many of you have been looking at our side , at our table , and thought “Those two are so much alike.” Arianna’s a glamorous woman with continental manners . I aspire to be the fittest fat person in America . </s>
Arianna created a business in which people write for free , and she sold it for more than $ 300 million . I have three credit cards , one of which I can use at any time . Throughout this entire debate , she’s been texting Matt Damon and Fergie . I’ve seen “The Bourne Identity.” </s>
Arianna and I agree on most things . In fact , I think I can safely say I agree with Zev and P.J . a lot more than I agree with Arianna . And yet if Arianna and I sat in a room and talked about the big issues facing our country , I bet we could reach some plausible solutions . But if we were elected to the two parties as they currently exist , we would never get in the same room because those two parties have gotten much more rigid . So when I take a look at the issues that are before us , and those issues have been alighted I think during this debate : Immigration , a vital issue about which the two parties can reach no agreement ; debt , a vital issue about which the two parties can reach no agreement . </s>
Wage stagnation and inequality , a long-growing issue about which the two parties can reach no agreements ; campaign finance . I could go on . </s>
These are all concrete issues that are right here in front of us . If you see a way for our current two-party system -- if you see an avenue for them to reach agreement and solutions on these issues , even in perfect solutions , well , then vote for the guys in the red ties . </s>
But if you do n't , vote for the glamorous side . Thank you . David Brooks . </s>
And that completes our closing statements . All right . Now it 's time to find out which side you feel argued best . We want to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seat to register your vote , reminding you you voted once before . And the team that has changed the most minds after this vote will be declared our winner . </s>
Our motion is “The two-party system is making America ungovernable.” If you agree , push number one . If you disagree , push number two . And if you are or became undecided , push number three . And we 're going to have the votes in just a minute . </s>
And I 'm going to announce the winner of the debate immediately afterwards . We 're going to put up on the screen how the numbers broke down according to party affiliations that you registered when you came in . I wo n't be announcing those , but you can look at them on the board afterwards , or you can visit us online . A few of the things I want to take care of . </s>
First of all , I have thoroughly enjoyed this debate , like perhaps none other this group has been absolutely terrific . I want to thank them for being smart as well as engaging and entertaining . </s>
I also want to draw attention to one of the unsung heroes of this series , Donna Wolfe who puts these things on all the time sitting in the front row . At a minimum , you could raise your hand . </s>
There you go . And I also want to thank the American Clean Skies Foundation who has underwritten this entire season of debates . And thank you to them . And what this season is about , through this spring , this winter and spring , the theme is , “America 's house divided.” </s>
That 's what tonight was a part of . </s>
Under that umbrella , and our next debate on Tuesday , the 8th of March , the topic is “Clean energy can drive America 's economic recovery.” Arguing for that motion we 'll have Bill Ritter , the former governor of Colorado who adopted one of the nation 's strictest renewable energy mandates and whose state has the fourth largest concentration of clean energy workers in the country . Joining him will be Dan Reicher , the former director of Climate Change and Energy Initiatives at Google , who served as assistant secretary of energy under Bill Clinton . He now leads a new interdisciplinary center at Stanford to advance clean energy technology . And arguing against that motion will be Robert Bryce who is the author of “Power Hungry : The Myths of Green Energy and the Real Fuels of the Future” and a self- described , quote , “Liberal who got mugged by the laws of thermodynamics.” </s>
And his partner will be Steven Hayward , the author of “Mere Environmentalism , ” an examination of the philosophical presuppositions underlying the environmental movement.” I wish I had written this myself . Tickets are available through our Website and also at the Skirball box office . And do n't forget to follow Intelligence Squared U.S. on Twitter and make sure to become a fan on Facebook , and you 'll receive a discount on upcoming debates . </s>
For those of you who would like to know more about our debate topics , you can go to our Web site , and we have research on tonight 's debate , arguments for and against and on also the debates that will be coming up . And our website is iq2us.org . All of our debates , as I said at the beginning , can be heard on NPR stations across the country .

And you just have to visit Bloomberg.com to find your local channel . </s>
Perfect timing . Okay . </s>
So it 's all in now . Remember , our motion is “The two-party system is making America ungovernable.” And the team that has changed the most minds in the course of this debate will be declared our winner . So here are the results . Before the debate , 46 percent were for the motion , 24 percent against and 30 percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , 50 percent are for the motion . That 's up four percent . </s>
40 percent are for the motion . That 's up 16 percent . 10 percent are undecided . The team arguing against the motion , “The two-party system is making America ungovernable has carried the debate.” Our congratulations to them . </s>
Thank you from me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S . Oh , I said what ? Can I have your patience ? I misread the numbers . These numbers are correct , but I misread them . I 'm just going to do it one more time . </s>
And your lovely , perfectly timed burst of applause was -- you did great , but -- but not me . Here are the results . Before the debate , 46 percent were for the motion , 24 percent against and 30 percent undecided . After the debate , 50 percent were for the motion . That 's up four percent . </s>
40 percent were against . </s>
That 's up 16 percent . And 10 percent were undecided . The side against the motion the two-party system is making America ungovernable has carried the debate . Our congratulations to them . </s>
And thank you from me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S . Welcome . As is often the case , uh , in New York on evenings of public discourse , the event begins with a bad joke . But I’m going to begin this event with a dangerous joke that I overheard on a reporting assignment that I did out in California very recently . And I was in the company of some , of a very diverse group of very successful business people who were sitting around in California talking about issues of the day . </s>
And one just was dying to tell the following joke , which I will repeat . It’s not one that I would necessarily tell except in the context of this debate and what we’re going to be discussing tonight . </s>
It seems at the Alamo – you know the Alamo – at the conclusion of the defeat of the defenders of that fort in Texas , Jim Bowie – who was one of the defenders – and one of his colleagues looked out the window and saw in the grounds of the fort the victorious Mexicans swarming in . And Bowie turned to his colleague and said , Are we pouring concrete today ? The laughter catches in your throat . </s>
And that joke and its relevance , its humor , its whatever that sort of hit on that day was very , very meaningful to me . Because it really sort of depicted for me , in a visceral kind of way , just how electrifying the immigration debate is , is in America right now . Um , on the eve of an election year , we see an issue in which American culture , American race , American economics , America’s sense of its own notion of freedom , inclusion and what we are as a nation , the actual definition of what it means to be American is all tied up in this thorny knot called the immigration debate . </s>
Um , and so it is in that context that I offer that very bad and dangerous joke tonight , um , to set the stage for what we hope will be a very , very lively event . Some of you have come to these before , um , and know the rules of the road . Others I will , um , like to lay out some of the details for all of you . </s>
Now , you know , we like audience participation . We like the fact that this is done before a live audience . You’ll notice this is a radio show here , microphones all over onstage , microphones all over on the side . Um , fill in the empty seats . Move forward . </s>
Kind of , you know , get , get collegial . Um , and , uh , of course , as is always the case , turn off your cell phones and beepers . We kinda like the sound track we have for our program here . We don’t necessarily need an addition from one of your electronic devices . </s>
Um , we , of course , want questions from you . You have cards , I believe . Does everyone see their cards that they have at their seat ? Um , we’re going to try something a little different on the questions this , this time around . </s>
We have pencils and let me just make sure that I get this right . Now , if you have a question fill out your card . Write the question . </s>
And unlike other debates , we’re going to do it a little bit differently . At the top either put your name , if you’re comfortable having me read your name or some way of identifying you . </s>
But I’m really , if it’s really hard to identify you I’m probably not going to use your question . So if you want your question used , even if you don’t want your name used , put Donald Duck at the top or something , just so I can at least say whoever said they’re Donald Duck , it’s your question . Cause I’m not going to waste a lot of time going , the person who says that they’re wearing the green shirt in the fourth row . </s>
I’m not going to do that , okay ? If you want your question answered a name or your name . Um , the ushers will collect your cards and they’ll give you a new card so you can ask as many questions as you like . </s>
Um , that is it . But obviously , we want something lively and wonderful and interesting . And , you know , the bar is high here because the debates that , uh , you have very previously attended have been very , very successful . </s>
I’m thrilled to be here . I am John Hockenberry . I , uh , previously you may know my name from , uh , National Public Radio . You may know it from , uh , NBC television . </s>
Um , I would like to introduce our sponsor and sort of uber host for this , uh , entire series – uh , Robert Rosenkranz , who is Chairman of the Rosenkranz Foundation and of course the sponsor of this evening’s debate . Well , thank you very much , John . Uh , Dana Wolfe , our Executive Producer , and I are very pleased to welcome you to tonight’s Intelligence Squared debate . </s>
Immigration will almost certainly be a major issue in the next Presidential election . It’s front page news when Governor Spitzer wants to issue driver’s licenses to illegal , uh , immigrants because these are our de facto identity cards . The very term illegal is emotionally charged – so much so that , uh , some of our panelists insisted on the word undocumented in our resolution . And yet the division and viewpoint does not fall along conventional liberal/conservative lines . </s>
In , in classical economics labor mobility benefits both the worker and his employer . And the gains seem obvious , just by a casual glance at our daily lives . Consider the growing number of immigrant laborers , many from Mexico and Central America , who have taken up housekeeping jobs , gardening , childcare jobs throughout the New York Metropolitan area in recent years . </s>
And then consider the large number of immigrant Ph.D. candidates , many of them Asian and Indian , who study science , engineering , mathematics and go on to key roles in our technology firms . At both ends of the economic spectrum , both the immigrants and those who employ them are better off . Surely this enhances our economic dynamism and global competitiveness . </s>
On the other hand , these benefits may come with associated costs , particularly for the unskilled migrants . </s>
Who bears the cost of their emergency medical care , of educating their children , of dealing with increased criminality and social unrest ? And isn’t the term undocumented just a euphemism for illegal ? And shouldn’t illegality be punished rather than rewarded ? In a post-9/11 world don’t we need special vigilance about who crosses our borders ? </s>
Well , emotions notwithstanding , there are good arguments on both sides and a lot to learn from our outstanding panel . Our moderator is John Hockenberry . </s>
He is an author , columnist , veteran broadcast news correspondent and teller of very bad jokes . </s>
He holds an array of astonishing , an astonishing a…array of awards or an array of astonishing awards and is the host of a new morning news program on WNYC , which is going to be starting early next year . John , the evening is yours . Thank you , Robert . </s>
I’d like to welcome you all to the second debate of the second Intelligence Squared U.S. series . I want to give you a brief rundown of how the evening is going to go . First , the proposer of the motion – and let me remind you what the motion is . </s>
The motion for tonight is : Let’s Stop Welcoming Undocumented Immigrants . The motion tonight is : Let’s Stop Welcoming Undocumented Immigrants . So , first , the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument . </s>
The opposition will follow . </s>
Each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we will go back and forth from one side to the other . Second , when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks I will open up the floor to brief questions from the audience , questions that I may have , questions that are motivated by our panelists who may want to address each other directly . Third , when the question and answer is complete , each debater will make a final statement , lasting not more than two minutes per person . And fourth , after the final closing statement is made you will vote on tonight’s motion with the key pad attached to the armrest at your seat . It looks like this . </s>
Look down , you all have one . And fifth , and last , I will announce the results of the audience vote and tell you which side carried the day . Beforehand , from our panelists let’s start with a pre-debate vote . Let’s do a little base line data here . Pick up the key pad attached to your armrest on the left . </s>
Remember this little guy here . For audience members sitting along the aisle to my right , your key pad is attached to the arm rest on your right side next to your neighbor’s . Does everyone have a key pad ? All right , when I prompt you , you will press one to vote for the motion , two to vote against the motion or three if you are undecided . Let’s Stop Welcoming Undocumented Immigrants – are you for , are you against or are you undecided ? </s>
You may begin voting now . </s>
All right . You seem very , very methodical and definitive there . Hmm , I’m very anxious to know the results . And I will reveal the results of your vote a little later in the evening . </s>
I will now introduce the panel . Please hold your applause until all six are introduced . We are thrilled to have all six of these people with us . Professor at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University , Vernon M. Briggs , Jr. is the , is speaking for the motion . </s>
Executive Director of the Center for Immigration Studies and Contributor to the National Review , Mark Krikorian , is also speaking for the motion . </s>
And the John M. Olin Fellow at the Manhattan Institute and contributing Editor to City Journal , Heather Mac Donald , is also speaking for the motion . Against the motion , Director of the Cato Institute Center for Trade Policy Studies , Daniel T. Griswold . </s>
Speaking against the motion , President and Founder of Border Angels , human rights activist , Enrique Morones . And also speaking against the motion , President and Executive Director of the Asian-American Justice Center , Karen K. Narasaki . All right , let’s begin . </s>
As you recall , each speaker will have eight minutes . Beginning tonight , speaking for the motion , Heather Mac Donald . Thank you very much , John . Two principles require that we stop welcoming undocumented immigrants , otherwise known as illegal aliens – respect for the rule of law and respect for facts on the ground . The ongoing violation of our immigration laws has reversed the traditional roles in a sovereign nation . </s>
It is now people living outside our border who determine our immigration policy , not Americans . The facts that result from this constant violation are these : a significant portion of the children of illegal Mexicans and Central Americans are adopting an underclass culture , as anyone can verify for himself by looking at social statistics or spending time in heavily Hispanic schools . </s>
Until we figure out how to prevent this from happening our unrestricted immigration flows guarantee social problems for years into the future . </s>
Now , on paper , our elected representatives continue to make our immigration rules . </s>
In reality , however , the power to determine who comes into the country and on what conditions , the most basic attribute of sovereignty , has passed from Congress to the world at large . A net half million aliens enter the country illegally each year . </s>
Once inside , they have enjoyed virtual immunity from any risk of penalties , as well as receiving a host of taxpayer benefits . Such immunity is now considered an entitlement . Any hint of enforcement , no matter how limited , inevitably provokes a massive outcry from immigrant advocates and immigrants themselves , that the government is behaving unfairly and , indeed , unlawfully . Disapproving headlines will blare from newspapers across the country . Quote : Fear among immigrants spreads , unquote . </s>
Mexican Consul Generals will complain bitterly that the government is psychologically abusing their countrymen by causing them to worry about their status . It seems that not only ill…do illegal aliens have the right to live here without being deported , they also have the right to live without thinking that they face even a minimum risk of being deported . </s>
This sense of entitlement does a great injustice to the thousands of law-abiding foreigners who are patiently waiting to enter the country legally . And it makes a mockery of our laws . I would like to ask our esteemed opposing team if they think that anyone should ever be deported for coming into the country illegally or whether they believe that once across the border he should be home free . </s>
Now , you may hear from Mr. Griswold tonight that our immigration laws are economically unwise . I and my colleagues vehemently disagree . </s>
But even if it were the case that controlling the border was bad economic policy , the sanctity of the law does not rest on whether it meets someone’s idea of optimal economic efficiency . Until the American people decide to change the law it should be respected and enforced . You may also hear tonight that we have tried immigration enforcement and that it has failed and therefore that we have no choice other than to allow the present inflood to continue . In fact , until a few months ago , there has been almost no immigration enforcement in the interior of the country . </s>
In 2004 a mere three firms were issued fine notices for employing illegal aliens out of the hundreds of thousands of such law-breaking employers across the country . To be sure , the country has progressively put more agents on the border . But once an illegal alien got across the border he entered a three million square mile sanctuary zone . This means that mass deportation is not required to revive the effectiveness of our immigration laws . </s>
The illegal population has burgeoned precisely because illegals assume they face absolutely no risk of enforcement , as the complaints about psychologically harassing illegal aliens with de minimis enforcement show . Increase that risk even slightly and calculations change . After 9/11 , the Department of Homeland Security deported fifteen hundred illegal Pakistanis living in , in New York , leading fifteen thousand more to leave on their own . </s>
A modest increase in enforcement would result in a similar reduction over time of the broader illegal alien population . The second principle supporting tonight’s motion is respect for facts on the ground . </s>
Those facts show that unrestrained illegal immigration is producing an underclass culture among many children of Hispanic illegal aliens . Talk to students in any heavily Latino school and you’ll hear something like this – told to me by an undocumented Guatemalan girl in Los Angeles – Quote : `` Most of the students I hung out with when I started school have dropped out . Others got kicked out or got into drugs . Five graduated and four homegirls got pregnant . '' This testimony is perfectly representative . </s>
Hispanics now have the highest teen pregnancy rate in the country . Moreover , fifty percent of Hispanic children are born out of wedlock , a rate two times that of whites and three times that of Asians . The stigma against unmarried child-rearing among teens has virtually disappeared . </s>
Hispanics have the highest school dropout rate in the country – fifty percent . And gang life is sucking in large numbers of Latino youth . The incarceration rate of Mexican-Americans jumps eightfold between the first and second generation , resulting in an incarceration rate three and a half times that of whites . Gang counselors in schools from Washington , D.C. to San Diego – </s>
One . …despair at the fact that younger and younger kids are joining gangs . To be sure , most Hispanic immigrants are industrious strivers who seize every opportunity available to them . </s>
But as long as many of the children are assimilating into the underclass and adopting its values , maintaining the current high levels of illegal entry will bring in its wake rising welfare and crime . </s>
In conclusion , we should continue to welcome legal immigrants who have respected American law from the moment they entered the country and in the way they entered it . But it is an insult to them to accord the same privileges to so-called undocumented immigrants who have chosen to flout the law . </s>
And it is not in the country’s self-interest to do so . Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you , Heather Mac Donald , speaking for the resolution . Now , to speak against the resolution , Daniel Griswold . Well , thank you , everybody , for coming out tonight . Uh , first I want to lodge a protest at the , uh , proposition that we’re debating . It’s a little bit like , uh , Have you stopped beating your wife , kind of question . </s>
I don’t think anybody up here is thrilled about having illegal immigrants in the United States . Our side would like to see them able to come legally . And I’d like you to think of the motion as , uh , Let’s Stop Welcoming More Legal Immigration . And I’d urge you to vote against it . Immigrants have made the United States a prosperous , dynamic and free country . </s>
They have throughout our history , they continue to do so today – both on the higher end of the skills spectrum – but I will argue tonight that low-skilled immigrants are also benefiting the United States . There are two powerful economic and demographic trends , two very positive ones , that are driving low- skilled immigration to the United States . On the demand side , our economy continues to create hundreds of thousands of net new jobs every year for low-skilled workers in fields like retail , cleaning , landscaping , food preparation . </s>
And at the same time , the supply of Americans who traditionally filled these jobs – Americans without a high school diploma – has been dropping steadily . We’re getting older , we’re getting better educated . </s>
Uh , less than ten percent of Americans , adult Americans , do not have a high school diploma , compared to fifty percent in the early 1960s . </s>
4.6 million fewer Americans are in the work force without a high school diploma today than just a decade ago . </s>
So we have a , a structural mismatch between demand and supply in our economy . And yet there’s no legal channel for a peaceful , hardworking twenty-four year old Mexican or Central American to come into the United States legally and fill these jobs that there are simply not enough Americans , uh , there to fill . And yes , we have tried enforcement and it’s failed . We have ramped up real spending on enforcement six-fold in the last two decades , line watch hours at the border eight-fold . We’ve built walls for miles into the desert . </s>
We have gone through periods of increased interior enforcement in the late Nineties and now again . It has made no dent . </s>
Enforcement without reform is doomed to fail . It has failed in the past and it continues to fail . You know , we rounded up a few thousand , uh , workers at a chicken processing plant , uh , in Georgia a while back . You know , two thousand down , eight million to go . </s>
It’s a futile exercise . There have been perverse consequences . Because of our enforcement those trying to get in are actually , uh , more successful because they’re going through more remote regions in the desert . </s>
It’s more dangerous . The death rate has tripled . Three or four hundred people are dying every year for the crime of wanting a better job and trying to cross the border . </s>
And here’s the irony : once they’re in they’re more likely to stay . </s>
Because of the expense and risk of crossing the border once they’re in they tend to stay . Traditionally we’ve had a strong circular component to Mexican migration . </s>
Eighty percent of them who came here eventually went back home , uh , as temporary immigrants . And we’ve interrupted that now and I think a legalization program would restore that circular flow . The only answer is immigration reform . We need to change the law . </s>
This is a broken , dysfunctional law . We need to change the law . You know , uh , and I think we need to both create a temporary worker program and legalize those who are here . </s>
We’re not talking amnesty . They would pay a fine , they would serve probation . That’s the penalty for a misdemeanor . </s>
It’s not a felony . It’s not a crime to be here . It’s a civil infraction . </s>
The punishment should fit the crime . The Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986 , of course , did , did none of that . Uh , but the missing piece was that it had no temporary worker program , no provision for legalizing future workers , and it failed . Let’s not make that mistake again . Back in the 1950s we had a problem with illegal immigration . </s>
We had the Bracero Program but the Visas were insufficient . We dramatically increased the Visas and illegal immigration dropped by ninety-five percent . Our side’s not talking about letting in more immigrants . We’re talking about turning in a flow of illegal and a population of illegal immigrants into a legal flow and population of i…of immigrants . </s>
You’ll hear the argument from the other side that this is bad for low-skilled Americans . Well , if you’re twenty- five years old and you don’t have a high school diploma you’re getting it from all sides . </s>
The best thing you can do is stay in school . You’ll get a thirty-eight percent raise just over somebody who’s dropped out . So it’s , the answer isn’t to build walls . It’s to encourage people to stay in school . </s>
You’ll hear about the fiscal and social costs and you’ve already heard that . </s>
Uh , I just don’t see it . </s>
Yes , low-skilled workers tend to consume more in government services than they pay in taxes , but I think the other side exaggerates those costs . The costs are manageable . We can control access to the welfare state . </s>
And they’re overwhelmed by the economic benefits to having a more , uh , expansive , uh , dynamic economy . The social costs : You know , Heather talked about this swelling underclass . </s>
I just don’t see it . </s>
In the last decade the poverty rate is down in the United States . Cri…crime is down by a third from the early 1990s – and this is with a doubling of the illegal immigrant population . The number of U.S. households headed by somebody without a high school diploma has dropped by more than ten percent , uh , in the last decade . So we have a shrinking underclass , uh , in this country and immigrants are helping to create , uh , opportunities throughout our economy . </s>
The answer , my friends , is to fence off the welfare state , not to fence off our country . </s>
Let me end by talking a little bit about national security . And I don’t need to remind people in New York how important that is . None of us want to see a repeat of September 11th . I think a sensible immigration reform program would enhance our security and bring order to the border . </s>
This is a very important thing . We would begin to drain the swamp of smuggling and document fraud that can facilitate , uh , terrorism . </s>
We’d encourage people to come forward , announce themselves to authorities , to cooperate , uh , with the police rather than living in the shadows and being afraid . And also we would free up resources to go after the real criminals and terrorists . Uh , I think that’s one reason why our Homeland , uh , Security boss , uh , Michael Chertoff , has been such a strong supporter of immigration reform . It would make his job easier . As he told Congress recently , uh , Immigration reform would , quote , `` dramatically reduce the pressure on our borders , aid our economy and ease the task of our law enforcement agents inside the country . '' </s>
What in the world is our Homeland Security Department doing using its scarce resources going after janitors and dishwashers and meat packers when it should be going after criminals and terrorists ? </s>
We need to stop wasting our dollars , manpower and lives in a futile effort to close our borders and turn away hardworking , peaceful immigrants . We need to change the law – One . </s>
…so that our country can welcome more legal immigrants to help us grow . </s>
And let me just end with a world about the rule of law . I’m all for enforcing the law . </s>
I’m all for obeying the law . But the law must be reasonable . </s>
It must be consistent with how normal people live their lives . In the 1930s we had alcohol prohibition . It made criminals out of millions of people who just wanted a drink after dinner . </s>
The American frontier was settled by illegal squatters and instead of clearing them off we passed the Homestead Act . Uh , we need to change the law so that our immigration law better reflects our needs as an economy , our need for a more secure nation and our highest values . Thank you very much . Thank you . </s>
Daniel Griswold , speaking against the resolution . I want to remind the audience if you have a question don’t wait . </s>
Jot it down on your card , pass it to the ushers on the aisles and you can ask for another card so that , uh , it’s not a one shot deal here . Uh , we definitely want to encourage your questions for the question and answer part of the program . We continue now . Speaking for the resolution , Vernon Briggs . Thank you very much . </s>
It’s a pleasure to be here . Please don’t let the other side confuse you . This is not about legal immigration . There’s a difference between legal immigration and illegal immigration . </s>
The topic tonight , which the vote is supposed to be on , is illegal im…immigration -- undocumented workers , if you want to call them that – but illegal immigration . </s>
That’s the issue and that’s the principle that I’m , uh , uh , that I’m in favor of stopping . Ille…And there are three reasons , basically . </s>
And I want to elaborate on each in a moment . The first is that illegal immigration is not a victim…victimless crime . There are people who lose and lose in big ways . </s>
And these are the most vulnerable people in our society – not the privileged , not the well-off , who…whom government is suppo…does a very , a pretty good job of protecting – but the most vulnerable , the unskilled , the poorly educated , the poorly trained , disproportionately youth , disproportionate minority , disproportionately women who bear the , the competition with illegal immigrants . And they’re hurt very badly . Just because some people win and other people lose doesn’t mean it’s on average , nothing happens . It’s a very , it has a very detrimental impact on those who lose . Secondly , and I to go back and talk about a moment , illegal immigration does erode one of the basic pillars of this society – the , the rule of law . </s>
And when we make mockeries of our laws we br…we , we engender , we , we , we encourage cynicism about the society in which we live in . What’s the sense of passing laws if nobody obeys them ? </s>
And lastly , I want to talk about the fact that illegal immigration exposes in a very obvious way the seamier side of our wonderful democracy . Uh , the willingness of some to tolerate the exploitation of human beings , uh , in our society , to find some ways to rationalize it . And the failure to stop this , these sores allows them then to , to fester and make conditions in this country much worse . It breeds cynicism about what our really core values of this nation are . But before I elaborate on those I want to say briefly how I got involved with this . </s>
I was invi…I became involved in this when I was a very young professor teaching at the University of Texas , when a man named Cesar Chavez came through Austin on the way to try to organize farm workers in south Texas in 1966 . And I joined with that movement and I went down to the border for the first time . I was not a Texan . I saw the border and I knew right away that the first day I was on the picket line that this strike was lost . </s>
We were overwhelmed by strike breakers and I’m saying to this day those , those people are still not organized in south Texas . </s>
And , uh , from those years in the Sixties and Seventies there was no greater spokesman for ending illegal immigration in this country than Cesar Chavez , who sued the Carter Administration for , uh , for its unwillingness to enforce immigration laws before we even had employer sanctions . </s>
Just trying to say these people shouldn’t be in here . That was Chavez’s line . And he believed it very strongly in those days when he was actively trying to organize farm workers . And he certainly made a big impression on me for the rest of my life . </s>
It’s also the case that I believe the position that we’re arguing is supported by the overwhelming balance of re…of research and findings about the adverse impact of illegal immigration on individuals and on our society . I want to elaborate on the three points now . First of all , with respect to adverse impact , there are ninety million – in a newspaper article just in last week’s Ithaca Journal – ninety million people that are adults in a population in the United States who only have only a high school diploma or less – ninety million . </s>
That’s half of the adult population of the entire country . Of that number , fifty million are in the civilian labor force . Almost one-third of the labor force doesn’t , has only a high school diploma or less . The problem this country faces , as this article makes , discusses very clearly , is that we have an over-supply of unqualified people in the country . It’s not that we have a shortage of unskilled workers that we need undocumented workers . </s>
And that over-supply is the group that are so adversely affected by illegal immigration . Those are the people overwhelmingly who are adversely affected in terms of their wage depression and limited opportunities . They’re the ones who have to compete with illegal immigration , immigrants for jobs . Uh , and that’s the ones we should , would be concerned with – the people that had the highest unemployment rates . The highest unemployment rates in the United States are those people in the high school grades , or high school-less , uh , uh , uh , cohort . </s>
Uh , the unemployment rate is , is over , it’s almost six percent for people without high school diplomas and for those people in some groups , even blacks without high school diplomas , it’s all…it’s , it’s twelve percent right now . So it’s hard to make any argument that there is a great shortage of unskilled workers when the highest unemployment rates in the United States are held by those who have the lowest level of education . Just what we’d expect , but the other side makes it out as if there’s a great shortage of unskilled workers in this country that would document , that would , uh , warrant the , uh , the coming of undocumented workers . That is absolutely not true . </s>
Absolutely not true . This , uh , this labor market is in surplus and that’s the problem . Why income levels at the bottom , uh , don’t go up , wages at the bottom don’t go up , why income distribution in this country is coming , uh , increasingly skewed , heading toward greater inequality . It’s , uh , and it’s , it’s a very dangerous thing for a society to have happen to it . Uh , we all know that if undocumented workers were pouring into the professional and legal ranks of this country , if they were coming into the professor ranks or the lawyer ranks or the doctors’ ranks or the business executive ranks , this issue would have been solved a long time ago . </s>
We all understand very clearly that this , uh , that the undocumented workers coming into the legal profession or the doctors’ profession five hundred thousand a year , was not good for the doctors in this country or the lawyers in this country who have to invest , uh , invest in their education and training and the , all the rest of it to get to those positions . Undocumented , not legal immigrants , but undocumented , illegal immigrants . </s>
But somehow when it comes to low-wage workers , low-skilled workers , farm workers , maids , yardmen and all the rest of these things – landscapers and restaurant employees and hotel employees – people forget about the laws of economics – that , uh , that , that , uh , increasing the supply of those workers when you have unemployment already , of high unemployment rates already in those markets , can only depress wages and working conditions and make conditions worse for those at the bottom of our society , and society . </s>
So , again , this is the first reason . </s>
Uh , illegal immigrants will always win in the competition for jobs . </s>
They become preferred workers . It’s not that U.S. citizens will not do these jobs . Employers don’t want them . </s>
Illegal immigrants will always work for the longest hours , the lowest pay or the worst working conditions because no matter how bad conditions are in this country , they’re infinitely better than they are in the countries that they came from . </s>
Remember , two billion people on this planet today earn less than two dollars a day . Two billion – half of all the workers in the world today . </s>
That’s what they make . So any condition in this country is way better than what they have had from most of the countries that they’ve come from . So in the competition for jobs they will always be a preferred worker if employers can have them . My view is they should not be allowed to have access to that supply of labor . </s>
That is a , that , that – and that’s what our law says , that’s what our law requires . It’s just we don’t enforce our laws . Secondly , the , the issue of , of , of the rule of law . </s>
Illegal immigrants , those who enter without inspection or overstay Visas are creating , are committing , uh , criminal misdemeanors . </s>
If they , if they over-stay their Visa – sorry , if they , if they’ve been deported and then come back in , it’s a felony offense . But we don’t enforce the laws . Uh , they get away , so there’s little risk , really in actually following any of those laws . One . Since , since 1986 illegal immigrants who come to the United States , um , uh , uh , are not required to work but they do work . </s>
Again , the laws that are not being enforced . </s>
I’m , I’m real , way behind , I guess , in what I wanted to say . It’s , uh , it’s illegal to use false documents , it’s illegal to , to use somebody else’s identity . </s>
It’s illegal to use someone’s else , the Social Security number . All those things have criminal offense but then nobody applies the laws . </s>
How many laws are these people of , uh , are entitled to violate without people becoming cynical about our rule of , our rule of law ? Uh , uh , driver’s licenses , social services , all the rest of it . Um , uh , the last point I wanted to make was about the , about the , the fragileness of our democracy . </s>
Uh , this exposes the seamier side of it by , by allowing illegal immigration to go on . It gives tacit , uh , uh , approval to their presence in our society and to its human , its human smugglers and abusive employers and unsafe work environments .

Speaking for the resolution , Vernon Briggs . Thank you very much . Thank you . </s>
Much more to say . Our next speaker against the resolution , Enrique Morones . Thank you . </s>
Yeah . </s>
Buenos noches . Good evening . Shalom . I’m glad to be in , uh , beautiful New York City once again . </s>
I wanted to , uh , first of all , thank everybody here and , and for the invitation to share a few moments with you . It’s important that we discuss in a civil manner and , uh , that we talk about the truth about this immigration situation . And I want to find out in the audience , uh , how many Native Americans are here ? </s>
How many hundred percent Native Americans that are indigenous , that could trace their roots to the tribes that were here thousands of years ago ? You know , maybe I might be the only one but I’ve got ta admit , only my dad’s side of the family -- eight thousand years . </s>
And on my mom’s side of the family I can only go back to the 1600s . And so it’s just to kind of say that even though this is a great country and I love the United States – I’m a U.S. citizen . I was born and raised in San Diego – my family came from Mexico and it came like most Mexican families . It came legally . And it came , like most immigrants come to this country , looking for a better opportunity . </s>
And it was driven by economics . My dad’s job had an opportunity in San Diego and , and we moved to San Diego . </s>
And I was born in San Diego . It’s very important that we look back on the history of this great country . And I don’t think that we’ve had a lot of welcoming , uh , to immigrants , especially if you look at it from the Native American point of view or the people of color point of view . I don’t see very much diversity but we’re all the same race – the human race . </s>
And I think it’s important that we treat each other in such a manner . And Cesar Chavez was mentioned a , a moment ago . They’re one of our biggest supporters , the United Farm Workers . And I ask you in your prayers to pray for Elena Chavez who was diagnosed with colon can…cancer just a couple of days ago – Cesar Chavez’s wife . </s>
And , uh , they’re , they’re big supporters of our movement and they’ve helped us in , in the efforts that we’re continuing , to have more humane laws . Ethel Kennedy , uh , Robert Kennedy’s wife , is really the one that inspired me to come out of the shadows when we started our work as , as Border Angels back in 1986 . And you’ll see some information on some flyers I have in the back for our all-volunteer organization . What we’re best known for is putting water in the desert – putting water in the desert to save people’s lives . </s>
But that’s not the only thing we do . </s>
We also were instrumental in the massive demonstrations last year which had three and a half million people take to the streets and say , We want humane and comprehensive immigration reform . We don’t want to have any more deaths on the border . We don’t want to have this hate radio and hate television that many of you are familiar with , that’s really sprung up in the last several years . Border Angels is a non-partisan faith based organization and our mar…what our mission statement says , `` If I was hungry did you give me to eat , if I was thirsty did you give me to drink ? '' Period . In October of 1994 the United States government decided to build a wall between the United States and Mexico . </s>
We protested against this wall . </s>
What the government said it’s gon na stop the flow of migrants . And I said , Why would it stop the flow of migrants ? The United States invaded Mexico in 1846 , took half its territory and there was a treaty that was signed – the Treaty of Guadalupe de Hidalgo – where people were supposed to be able to go back and forth , freely . That was never honored . But there’s nobody alive today that was there when the United States invaded Mexico in 1846 . </s>
What country has not committed sins ? </s>
Every country . Every country has racist , every country has people that misinform the public . </s>
So let’s stick to the facts . And I want to tell you a couple of stories . In October of 1994 the government put up this wall , called Operation Gatekeeper . And it’s been estimated by the flyer that I have in the back that four thousand five hundred people have died in the last thirteen years . </s>
And that’s an estimate , according to the Border Patrol . But I think the number is closer to ten thousand people . It , whether it’s four thousand , five hundred or ten thousand , people should not be dying because they’re coming here for a better opportunity . Lucretia Dominguez was one of those people . </s>
She crossed with two of her children , Jesus and Nora . Jesus , a fifteen year old little boy and Nora , a seven year old little girl . She crossed from Sonora to Arizona . And she crossed the only way she could because poor people can not get Visas . </s>
So when people tell you , Why don’t they just get in line ? </s>
– What line ? There is no line . So she crossed . She crossed with an unethical smuggler , like many of them are – and we’re opposed to that , of course – and a group of migrants . </s>
And what happened was , they ran out of water . The smugglers said , `` You’re slowing us down . You got ta cross on your own… '' They left , she left her behind with two of her children . She literally died in the arms of Jesus , her fifteen year old son . </s>
And her sister , his sister Nora was watching this . Two children in the middle of the desert were wandering around with their dead mother there . Thank God the border patrol found them and sent them back to Mexico . Their grandfather , Cesario , who is from Zacatecas , says , I don’t want to leave my daughter out there . So he went out looking for his daughter . </s>
He found one body , another body , another body before he found the body of his daughter . </s>
So if Cesario can find three other bodies , how many bodies are out there ? We think it’s approximately ten thousand people that have died . </s>
Not only men , but also children . </s>
Marco Antonio Viasenor – he died . </s>
He was a five year old little boy . </s>
And when he ran out of water he asked his dad for water . But his dad didn’t answer him . </s>
So he asked seventeen other men . </s>
They didn’t answer him . Cause all eighteen men had died , including Marco Antonio Viasenor , in the back in the back of a semi-truck in Victoria , Texas . This is the real story of what’s happening right now . </s>
It’s inhumane and we can do better than that as a people . We are a great people and we are a great nation . There’s a lot of myths and mis…misinformation that’s out there . And we’ve heard some hateful terms , even in the discussion today -- sucking in , homegirl . </s>
This type of terminology to dehumanize people is unacceptable . Jose Luis Cisneros was attacked by three American kids – a hate crime , which is at an all time high right now in the United States . We see the vigilante groups , like the Minute Men , which President Bush has called vigilante , uh , hate groups . </s>
Today is like yesterday . Second and third generation immigrants and half of them are not from Mexico . It was referred to Mexican immigrants . </s>
Half of the undocumented people are not from Mexico . </s>
They come from other parts of the world for economic opportunity . </s>
They assimilate . They learn the language , just like your , like you did in , in the , in the many years that you’ve been here . There was a man that said , They’re not learning the language , they’re not assimilating . They want to just practice their own culture . </s>
We got ta stop them . Franklin , talking about the Germanization of the United States . This has been going on for many , many years . There’s two hundred million plus undocumented people in the world . Only four percent of them live in the United States and of those twelve million , a third of them came here legally and their Visas expired – work , tourist or student Visas . </s>
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s in that category . Maybe we should have sent him back . But then there’s eight million other people that can not get a Visa . These are poor people looking for a better economic opportunity and they’re sacrificing everything coming across the border . </s>
Ninety percent of them come for economic reasons , ten percent come from fam…for family reunification . They already have a relative living here . As Dan mentioned , it’s an economic plus , the undocumented people in this country . </s>
They’ll tell you that schools and hospitals are closing . They are . We need health care reform , we need educational reform . </s>
But don’t blame the migrants . </s>
It’s easy to blame the most vulnerable sector of society . </s>
Four percent of the world’s population lives in the United States -- three hundred million people – yet we consume over twenty percent of the world’s natural resources , fifty percent of the world’s illegal drugs . We have thirty percent – </s>
One . </s>
…of the world’s population , uh , uh , environmental damage is caused by American companies . We could do better than that . Crime , the Department of Justice issued a study in which undocumented people are less prone to commit crime and less violent . </s>
Criminals are lazy people . Why are they going to cross a border to commit crime ? It’s legal versus illegal . If we use that premise all the time we would still have slavery , women could not vote , we’d still have children working in factories . We need to build bridges of communication and triple fences of su…se…of separation . </s>
What good is it if we gain the whole world but lose our souls ? There’s three and a half million people that have marched for immigration reform . Your grandchildren are going to ask you one day , What did you do when they were raiding families at three in the morning , when , when two people were dying every day crossing the border ? The whole world is watching . </s>
Do the right thing . We need humane and comprehensive immigration reform . </s>
We’re a better country than that . We’re a better people than that . And it’s important that we practice what we preach . We should love our neighbor . And we were , when we were told to love our neighbor I’m sure it didn’t mean to kill ‘em . </s>
Thank you all and God bless you . Enrique Morones , speaking against the resolution , Enrique Morones . If you have questions pass them to the aisle at the end of the row where you are so that we can make sure that we have plenty of questions for the question and answer period . </s>
Our next speaker is speaking for the resolution , Mark Krikorian . Apparently I’m here to argue that we should not love our neighbor . </s>
But that won’t be the substance of my talk . </s>
Uh , the other side is claiming that , uh , the flow of people into the United States is inevitable , that it’s like the tides or continental drift and that we need to lie back and pretend to enjoy it . The fact , though , is that there’s nothing inevitable about , uh , the flow of people from abroad . It’s an artifact of government policy . The analogy they often use is to the fifty-five mile an hour speed limit on an interstate and that it’s unnatural and therefore it has , that’s why people are violating the , uh , speed limit . The fact , though , is that an interstate highway is engineered for a particular speed . </s>
It’s designed for seventy mile an hour traffic -- the , uh , angles , the sightlines , the width of the shoulders . </s>
No economy , our economy is not engineered for any particular level of immigration . It can adapt to high levels of immigration , even higher than we have now . It can adapt to dramatically lower levels of immigration . The question is , what are the side effects , what are the consequences , what level of immigration do we want ? </s>
Through our elected representatives we’ve made a decision – incoherent sometimes as it is – about what our legal immigration policy should be . Given what our legal immigration policy is it needs to be enforced , whatever it happens to be . If it’s changed , if the numbers are increased , decreased , what have you , the , the law needs to be enforced if it’s to mean anything . And there’s two ways you enforce immigration law . </s>
One is the conventional method of arresting and detaining and deporting people . </s>
We do that . We don’t really frankly do as much of that as , uh , you might think , but we do some of that and we need to do more of it . </s>
But at least as important , if not more important , is the other element of enforcement of any laws -- but specifically in immigration laws -- is to deter lawbreaking , to dissuade those abroad from sneaking in or overstaying their Visas and to encourage , especially the more recent illegal immigrants , to leave and go home . Um , and the welcome that we have , in fact , extended and been extending to illegal immigrants for many years now , uh , it subverts that second element of law enforcement . </s>
So what that means is we have two choices -- either focus even more on rounding up , arresting , detaining and deporting people , leaving that as our sole approach to enforce immigration law – or just give up enforcing immigration law and have de facto open borders – which , despite all the disclaimers , is what the other side wants . </s>
Now , um , just enforcing immigration law in the conventional way – border patrol agents , uh , immi…uh , immigration agents inside the country raiding work places and homes – relying only on that kind of enforcement can’t work . Uh , we haven’t actually done all that much of it , uh , but however much we increase it , it can’t be the sole basis of our immigration enforcement approach . We need to have , uh , deterrence and what you might call encouraging voluntary compliance . After all , the IRS doesn’t arrest everybody . It doesn’t , it isn’t in everybody’s , uh , accountant’s office , making sure the rule , the , the forms are filled out properly . </s>
Uh , a few people are made examples of , and everyone else - most everyone else , uh , in our country remarkably compared to most places - complies with the law more or less , voluntarily . And so , what is it that we are doing ? </s>
What is this “welcome” that we are talking about ? What does it consist of ? What are we doing to essentially subvert enforcement of our own immigration laws ? </s>
Some of these things you have already , um , you are familiar with , of course . Uh , Mr. Rosenkranz referred to , uh , Governor Spitzer’s rule on driver’s licenses . </s>
Uh , the driver’s license is , in fact , our national ID system . And anything that makes it easy for illegal immigrants to get licenses , means it makes it easy for them to live here and to embed themselves in our society . Jobs . </s>
In 19… It was only in 1986 that the employment of illegal immigrants was prohibited by law . Before that , it was explicitly permitted in something called , not coincidentally , the Texas Proviso , where employers were held , uh , unaccountable for employing illegal immigrants . We did change it in 1986 . But contrary to Dan’s claims , we have done nothing to enforce it in the past 20 years . Nothing . </s>
Bupkis . We have gone through sort of , uh , cabooky efforts at finding a few people , as Heather mentioned . Uh , in 2003 was the low point of enforcement . And three employers , in the entire United States , were fined for knowing employment of illegal immigrants . We don’t even do basic things like tell employers , that they have submitted a fake or stolen Social Security number , uh , from an illegal immigrant employer…uh , employee . </s>
And that matters , because the majority of illegal immigrants work on the books . </s>
They actually gave their employers a fake or a stolen Social Security number . We don’t even tell employers and hold them accountable for making sure that that information is correct . Another example of the “welcome” we extend immigrants is , uh , bank accounts . The Treasury Department , just a couple of years ago…told banks inexplicitly , in writing…that it was OK for them to give bank accounts to illegal immigrants using , um , the Mexican government’s illegal alien ID card . </s>
That that was explicitly permitted by the law , and they shouldn’t , uh , be dissuaded from doing that . Um , another example . In-state tuition . Now , there is not that many illegal aliens going to state universities and getting , uh , in-state tuition subsidies . </s>
But symbolically , it’s very important . </s>
It is another part of the “welcome” that we extend illegal immigrants , which subverts our efforts to make whatever our immigration policy is stick . What we really need in ending this “welcome” is to pursue what I’d like to call a “firewall” strategy . Make it not just difficult to get in the country , which is something we need to do , but also make it hard to gain access to the important institutions of our society…so that it becomes as difficult as possible to be an illegal immigrant . </s>
So you can’t get a driver’s license , you can’t get a job , etc . </s>
Only in that way can we successful dissuade new illegal immigrants from sneaking into the country , and persuade some significant portion of those to leave . </s>
That’s… I describe that as an “attrition” policy . In other words , not magically eliminating the illegal immigration problem , but causing the illegal immigrant population… One . </s>
…instead of growing every year , to start declining every year . </s>
It’s a realistic approach . It’s not a pipe dream . Heather mentioned the Pakistani illegal immigrants after 9/11 . But , um , the New York Times and the USA Today just in the past couple of weeks have written about how the new , very modest but real , increases in immigration enforcement are in fact impelling significant numbers of people to get the message - that the party is over , and it’s time for them to go home . It works . </s>
Our research shows we could reduce the illegal population by half in five years , through normal law enforcement methods - not tattoos , not machine guns , not landmines - normal law enforcement , consistently applied . </s>
And that’s the key . Normal law enforcement , consistently applied . </s>
And not welcoming illegal immigrants with one hand , while we - in some instances - make it harder on the other hand . We need a consistent , unmixed message to illegal immigrants . And you’ll be surprised… Speaking for the resolution , Mark Krikorian . </s>
And thank you very much , Mark . </s>
Thank you . Our last speaker for this portion , speaking against the resolution , is Karen Narasaki . Thanks . </s>
Good evening . </s>
While superficially the topic tonight is about “undocumented immigration , ” the debate taking place in this country is really a deeper one . And it’s about whether immigrants - legal or not - are bad for America . And if you listen closely to Heather , it’s about whether Latino immigrants specifically are in fact destroying the fabric of our culture . Now , everybody here actually on stage agrees on one thing , and that is our current immigration system is broken . </s>
What we disagree about is what is broken about it , and how best to fix it . If you vote for us , it’s because you share our belief , that immigrants are in fact integral to who we are as America , and that they and their children are integral to the betterment and future of our country . Indeed , our core values as a nation are constantly renewed by immigrants , who come here seeking freedom and fairness , and opportunity for themselves and their families . </s>
The vibrancy and boldness of the youthful “can do” attitude , the spirit of America , is refreshed by immigrants who have the courage , the strength and initiative to leave their homes and their loved ones - and in many cases , uh , as Enrique said - risk their lives to be part of the American Dream . </s>
Throughout our history , there have been people arguing that immigrants are “taking jobs and failing to assimilate.” That immigrants from certain religious , ethnic or racial backgrounds are “culturally unfit or unwilling to be Americans.” That they bring “ignorance , poverty and disease , and threaten the dominance of English.” </s>
That’s what was said about the Know Nothings who argued about the Italians , the Irish , the Germans , the Jews , and even the Asians in the last century . And that’s what’s being said by the restrictionists today . Yet , in every case , immigrants and their children built businesses , they learned English , they joined the military - often in the face of discrimination against them , because of their religion or because of their race . Current immigrants are learning English even faster than the past - and are helping to drive the creation of small businesses here in New York and around the country . And as we stand here debating tonight , immigrants and their sons and daughters are in Afghanistan and Iraq , defending American values . </s>
And I am talking about immigrants who are not even yet citizens . Now , restrictionists have consistently been on the wrong side of history . And if you vote with them , it’s because - despite our long experience as a nation - you share their doubt about the power of American culture and American values . Rather than dealing with their very discomforting dislocations - and they are scary , brought about by globalization and the new Internet driven economy - it’s easier to blame immigrants and target them for their fears , as if , if they all went away , magically we wouldn’t have these new challenges . </s>
They hope to keep jobs in America by building high walls . And if we follow their old-school , isolationist prescription , America’s ability to generate jobs and compete in the global economy will fail . </s>
Before computers and the Internet maybe , and the globalization of corporations , it might have been possible to lock those jobs in . That’s no longer the case . Even agra business , is moving across borders , with American companies buying farmland in Mexico , because they can’t get the workers they need here in the U.S . </s>
And what about… ? </s>
What does that mean in terms of our food security…that we can no longer fully feed ourselves ? </s>
Vernon talked about “class.” Well , it’s true that immigration challenges at all levels , actually . </s>
The American Bar Association magazine this month featured a story on the outsourcing of legal work to India . Because the reality is today , with the Internet , even if you keep immigrants out , it doesn’t mean that the jobs are staying here . </s>
All of us agree that a system which results in a huge number of undocumented… undocumented immigrants who are extremely vulnerable to the exploitation that the professor talked about , is not good . Because many restrictionists believe that immigrants are the root of these problems , their solutions tend to be reactionary policies that foster division , and actually backfire on communities and American citizens . I want to be clear . Despite the back and forth , we are not arguing for open borders , and we are not arguing that our laws should not be enforced . What we are saying is let’s be smart . </s>
Let’s talk about what laws need to change , so in fact they are enforceable and they make sense . </s>
Laws only function when they are humane . </s>
And right now , our immigration laws are not humane , and they do not make sense . As Dan said , we don’t provide a realistic number of visas or permanent green cards . The backlog for spouses and children to join with a legal permanent resident is now five to ten years . Is that smart ? </s>
That’s why we have so many undocumented immigration . How many people would wait ten years to be with their spouse or child ? The backlog for high-tech workers to get a green card , once they have already proven their value to our economy , is now five to seven years . </s>
The number of visas available for temporary , low-skilled workers is 5,000 a year . Now we could debate what the numbers should be . But I think most of you would find it strikingly unrealistic to say , that 5,000 is the right number . Restrictionists talk about attrition through raids and hostile policies . And what they really mean is making our community so uncomfortable that people who - as was pointed out by Mark - are finding much better wages here , are gon na be forced back across the border . </s>
We believe that it makes sense to reform the system to provide sufficient channels for legal entry , bring the current undocumented out of the shadows . </s>
Nobody really believes we can get 12 million out . </s>
And more vigorously enforce existing anti-discrimination , wage and hour , health and safety laws in the workplace . The restrictionists don’t talk about that . That is why undocumented get exploited . That’s why employers like to hire them . Because we are not enforcing the wage and hour , and health and safety . </s>
Ten years ago , there was one inspector of restaurants in New York for wage and hour . That is ridiculous . We can reduce incentives without punishing everybody . </s>
For example , what is going to happen now , Bush… The Bush administration is going to now require employers to match their Social Security numbers . And if you don’t… Uh , if you have a “no match , ” you have 30 days to clear it up . 30 days ? The Inspector General of the Social Security Administration says , “We have at least 17 million errors in the data.” There is only 12 million undocumented . </s>
So what does that mean ? That means a lot of us… </s>
One . …are gon na get caught up in that system . So what we are saying is , let’s have reasonable laws . Mark talks about “licenses.” Well , we are not giving licenses to immigrants to help them . </s>
We are giving licenses because we would prefer that everybody driving on the road can get insurance and take the tests and know the rules of the road . By not providing them with licenses…with driver’s license , we are only punishing everybody else who is on the road with them . </s>
At bottom , the question is - do we really want to be the kind of community that refuses emergency health care to someone because they can’t produce a birth certificate or a green card ? Do we want to be the kind of community like Riverside , New Jersey , that found that their economic revival of their downtown was reversed overnight when they decided it was best to pass hostile symbolic measures ? And now Main Street is boarded up , and property values have tanked . Speaking against the resolution… Thank you . </s>
…Karen Narasaki . Thank you very much . </s>
Let’s give a warm applause to all of the speakers who have set the table for the debate . Thanks to all of you . </s>
I am now ready to announce the results of the pre-debate vote , however you are thinking now . This is a bit of a snapshot of what you were thinking just a few moments ago . </s>
Before the debate , this is how you voted . For the resolution , 42 percent , let’s stop welcoming undocumented immigrants . Against the resolution , 34 percent . </s>
Undecided , 24 percent . Now we’ll have a chance to vote and see if those numbers change , at the conclusion of the debate tonight . We are now ready to begin the question and answer portion of the program . If you haven’t done so , please write your question down and send it to the aisles , it will get to me , and we’ll have a chance to be a part of this , uh…a part of the , uh…this more lively part of the debate . </s>
Now , if I call on you…I will pick from the cards , I will call on you . Please stand , don’t ask your question until a microphone comes to you . And please identify yourself , if you are a member of the press . </s>
You know , I can’t say this enough . Make your question short and to the point . Um , there is only one Charlie Rose . We love him . I am gon na begin though by offering a question to each side of , uh , the audience here . </s>
Um , and I , and I think it focuses on what I consider to be something of the elephant in the room in this whole debate . There are an estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants in the United States . Um , for those of you supporting the resolution - and I’ll address to you , Heather . </s>
Uh , under any regime that you have discussed tonight of “law enforcement” or “changes in laws , ” how would you define “success” ? </s>
And in the case that you would achieve that success , how many fewer of that 12 million undocumented immigrants would be in the country , after your regime is adopted ? And to this side of the table , under any sort of change in immigration laws that any of you envision , how many of those 12 million would be allowed to stay , conditionally , unconditionally , or under any sort of regime that you envision ? I’ll begin with you , Heather . Well , I , uh , I sort of reject the question , John , ‘cause I don’t think it’s necessary to put an absolute number on it . </s>
I would think “success” would be , uh , seeing the changed decision making that , that Mark and I spoke about . </s>
That once you start enforcing the law , you are gon na see much fewer people come across the border . Well , “much fewer” ? How , how many fewer ? In , in one stretch of Texas that started , uh , not just putting people on the border , but detaining them , uh , after they were apprehended - rather than the current “catch and release policy” - there has been a 50 percent drop in illegal , uh , crossings…in a few months . The Washington Post itself declared that this shows that the way to get control of the border is simply to enforce the laws…on the books . </s>
We don’t need new laws ; we just need to enforce what’s already there… All right . …something that has not been done . So , in five years , if enforcement - under the regime that you are talking about - actually took place , how many “fewer” undocumented immigrants would you expect to be in the United States…down from 12 million ? I , I , I really couldn’t predict . </s>
But fewer… Any fewer would be a success . Whether it would be half that , uh…I , I can’t say . But the fact is , is that right now , we are sending a message to the , hmmm , billions of people in this world that , once they get across the border , nothing happens to them . If we have an “amnesty , ” I can predict what will happen : More will be coming in illegally . That is what the consequences have been of every amnesty…in this country…and in Europe . </s>
Uh , that record is quite clear . All right . Thank you , Heather . Uh , Enrique , let me ask the question to you . How many would you offer , uh , the chance to stay , of that 12 million ? </s>
Well , we have approximately 12 million undocumented people in the country today . And I think that the people that have…that are the real criminals…those are the people that should be in prison and…that which is a very , very slow - a very , very small percentage . So the overwhelming majority of these people would be allowed to stay and become documented . They are not looking for citizenship ; they are looking for a document , like the driver’s license . </s>
Some sort of document . And a driver’s license doesn’t give ‘em the right to be here , by the way . But they are looking for a document that allows them to stay . </s>
It’s an economic plus to have the economic…the , the undocumented people here . There is people from the Wall Street Journal here , Business Week . </s>
They have all said that it’s an economic plus . Seven billion dollars a year goes to Social Security just from the undocumented community . The median age of the U.S. population is 40 years old . The undocumented community is 25 years old . </s>
We need to replenish our workforce . Uh , uh , uh , uh , you know , what , what’s happening in this country today , it’s very , very important . These people are here to work . When was the last time you saw a Latino on a corner with a sign that says , “We’ll work for food” ? You don’t see it . </s>
You’ll see ten of them at the Home Depot ready to jump in your car . We need the workers . Unemployment is at 4-1/2 percent in this country . </s>
So they are an economic plus . </s>
They are , they are a plus to the values of this country . And it’s what that makes this a great country - a United States of America with all the colors . And so I say the 12 million people that are here - with the exception of the criminals , which is a very , very small percentage - they should be allowed to stay and have a pathway to legalization . </s>
So very close to 12 million undocumented immigrants would be allowed a chance to become citizens , under your plan ? Mm-hmm . To have document . To become documented . </s>
Right . To become documented citizens . </s>
All right . </s>
Uh , Gerry Ohrstrom has a question . He is on the left-hand side , in Row H. Could you stand ? Please . </s>
Uh , thank you . Um , Heather , I think I’ll address this to you , my good friend . Thank you . Uh , given my utterly blind luck in being born American , by what moral authority can I deny that same opportunity and privilege to any of the world’s other six billion inhabitants ? </s>
And any of your colleagues are welcome to respond to that as well . </s>
I think it is what nations do . They have borders . Uh , if you are suggesting that there should be no more nations in this world , that is a very radical change . </s>
Uh , and I don’t think that our , uh , neighbors to our south would agree with that either . </s>
You know , uh , Enrique talks about our “inhumane laws.” Well , Mexico has about the fiercest , uh , border patrol that you can imagine , that rounds up Central Americans that are coming in transit to get to the United States . Uh , this has been a prerogative of nations uh , throughout history , to decide who comes in . </s>
It , it’s not a “moral” question . </s>
It’s simply the right of , of nations to decide who is , is within their borders and who is outside of them . Mexico , uh , you know… Several years ago , a governor of Baja suggested that perhaps Mexico has some responsibility for preventing these deaths , uh , in the desert , because they have a law that requires people leaving the country to exit through lawful ports of exit and entry . Uh , and he suggested that maybe if Mexico started enforcing that law , it would decrease the deaths . And of course , this created a massive outcry , uh , among the Mexican elites , who believe that it is the right of Mexicans to immigrate into the country illegally . </s>
I disagree with that and I think , uh , Mexico itself would say the same about people from Nicaragua and El Salvador . John , could I just answer that ? Yeah . Go ahead , Mark . </s>
And I would have to disagree just a tiny bit and say that it is a moral question . That the nation is a moral good . Uh , it often doesn’t behave morally , but that’s a different question . It is , hmmm… Peoplehood is part of what we as human beings have programmed in us ; belonging to , uh , a people . </s>
And that means that we have a greater moral responsibility to those who are - us - who are , uh , fellow members of our people , than we do to foreigners . It doesn’t mean we have no responsibility to those who live outside our national community , but our priority has to be those who are our countrymen : Just as you feed your children first , before you give money to charity . And so , I would submit that , um , that , uh , arguing that everyone in the world has a right to come to the United States is itself immoral . The argument itself is morally wrong . John , if I could… </s>
Uh , Mark Krikorian , thank you very much . I want to… Enrique . </s>
I want to address a couple of quick… Enrique Morones . …quick comments . One about the Mexico part . </s>
And that was a , uh , senator , a former… a former mayor of Tijuana that made that statement , Hector Osuna . </s>
And the , uh… And , and he is right . We can not ask of the north what we don’t do in the south in Mexico . And I was just down in Mexico just two weeks ago . And this is a worldwide phenomenon . And Mexico definitely needs to do more , as do the other countries around the world . </s>
So that , that… With that being said . </s>
But the , the impact of U.S. policies affects the entire world . </s>
When you talk about the United States doing something , and it has a cold , it…it sneezes , the entire world - especially the Americas - get a cold . When Mexico does something and it has problems , that stays within Mexico . Mexico doesn’t want the people to leave . They know that the future of Mexico is within Mexico . </s>
But the people are starving . We need to , uh , help the United States…help Mexico more develop , and help other countries as well . We have that moral responsibility . Remember…remember what I said about four percent of the world’s population consuming over 20 percent of the world’s natural resources - the drugs and , and all these other things ? That greatly impacts the neighboring countries . </s>
It’s very , very important . And we should have some sort of a… The , the constitution of Mexico says that we have the freedom of movement . We are not denied the opportunity to go to other…to other countries . But it doesn’t encourage - contrary to what you have seen in these myths - people crossing to other countries without papers . </s>
My organization does not encourage that . People should cross…cross in a humane manner . And that’s what we are asking for - humane and comprehensive immigration reform . </s>
Comprehensive - that 12 million people get a pathway to , to legal…the document . And humane - having a humane manner in which people can enter , which doesn’t exist right now . Enrique , do you…do you believe that anyone who wants to come to America should be allowed to come here ? I think there should be a process that they would go through . </s>
That right now , if you are poor , you don’t get that opportunity . And there should be that opportunity . We should have humane laws to address that . Karen Narasaki . Well , I think this is where we get into these false choices . </s>
Um , and one of the false choices here is , we either enforce and become a police state , or we let everybody in the world in . That’s not really the choice . </s>
I mean , if we want to deal with Mexico… As Enrique says , a lot of the policies…the trade policies and other things… that Americans have done is why…is what drives a lot of immigrants here . That’s why we have a huge refugee population here . So what we need to do is - in addition to looking at what we are doing with the system here - we need to look at , what are our policies around the world ? How much help are we giving to Mexico and other countries , who are sending countries ? How are we helping them to stabilize their democracies ? </s>
How are we helping them to grow their economies ? I mean , the Philippines is one of the large…the largest sending countries in the world . </s>
They get more money from remittances from Filipinos who are around the world…than they get in foreign aid . We have to change that . We have to really think outside the box . It’s not just about punishing people who are here who are looking for a better life , but it’s - what can we do as a nation to change how we approach the problem ? </s>
Because it isn’t a choice of , we beat up people , or we let everybody in . That is not the choice . </s>
But it does sound like that’s the choice . I have yet to hear anybody on the opposing team say whether they think there should ever be any immigration enforcement . Do you think a penalty should ever be levied against somebody who comes… ? We say… </s>
…into the country ? </s>
As Heather said , we believe in enforcement . And we are not talking about… What would you do ? </s>
We are talking about smart enforcement . But tell me what you would do… </s>
But I am talking about… …if somebody comes into the country illegally . </s>
I talked about…waging our health and safety . </s>
And I talked about , if we are gon na do… But that’s not immigration laws… …and if we are going to… And if we are going to de…deportation , I don’t think it should be by raiding people , pre-dawn raids , with people wearing cowboy hats , carrying machine guns aimed at children . So should raids be at noon ? I don’t think that’s who we should be , as a nation . </s>
Should people wear different kinds of hats ? </s>
I mean , I think it’s a legitimate question . </s>
I mean , I am not trying to make the joke here , but… That’s Mark Krikorian . I , I have to say - and I have been doing this now for more than 12 years , specifically in this job - and I have got to say , I have never heard someone on that side of the debate say , “Yes , this specific enforcement action” - and I am not talking about , you know , criminals , uh , you know , drug dealers or something - regular immigration violation - that “This specific enforcement action is OK . This , I approve of.” I have never found… </s>
Mark… Mark , that is not… I , I want to answer this question… …a single person ever… </s>
Mark , that is not true . We supported… Daniel Griswold . </s>
Yes . Heather… …we supported comprehensive reform… …Heather , I , I would… </s>
…which had… Well , let…let Karen finish , and then Daniel . Yeah . And which had tough employer standards… I am talking about actual enforcement , not the… </s>
…that they were done reasonably . …not promises of future enforcement . </s>
Is there anything that’s ever happened - any enforcement action in the past say 20 years - that’s , that anyone on your side would be able to say , “Yeah OK , that’s good enforcement . That , I am all for.” All right . Never . </s>
I have never heard a single one . </s>
All right . And I would… Daniel . …I would favor enforcement , if we had a law that was… </s>
And who doesn’t ? I am very interested… …if we had a law that was enforceable , and we weren’t throwing money down a rathole , which is what we are doing now . And until recently… </s>
All right . But it is enforceable… Hold on , hold on one second . But isn’t it interesting… Let’s focus on the specific question . </s>
Is there any… ? And go down the , the , the , the three of you here on this side - Karen , Enrique and Daniel . Is there any enforcement that you would consider to be “good” enforcement , in terms of immigration ? </s>
Not , not so much the wage and hour issues that you were talking about - and I take your point . Uh , any enforcement of immigration laws that you would consider to be rational and not “money down a rathole” ? Daniel Griswold . Well , one , the law has to be rational . </s>
And our law is irrational . And we have two very different views here… </s>
Give me a rational law . </s>
A rational law recognizes the reality of the U.S. economy . We need these workers . We are better off with these workers . </s>
The reason half a million come a year - and not two and a half million but just half a million - is that’s about the demand of our economy . </s>
If we had a law that reflected our needs as an economy , our values as a nation , you would not have , uh , people coming across the border just to work . So… So in that case , the regulation would be… If , if , if , you know , Burger King here in , uh , you know , uh , Austin , Texas can guarantee you a job , you get a visa . Yes . </s>
And if… And if there is no job for you , you can’t just show up on a street corner ? Right . </s>
And that would be… And that would be a law that you would support… Whatever happens in the market . And the wagering . </s>
And they , and they don’t come , if there is not a job . And it’s very expensive to come here and not have a job and hang around . In the 1950s , we dramatically increased the number of visas . </s>
Illegal immigration dropped by 95 percent . That’s our vision . It’s a system that worked in the past . It’ll work in the future . And they are asking you to buy a pig in a poke . </s>
“This time , if we just spend enough money , if we just station enough agents on the border , if we just raid enough chickens…” And that’s absolutely false . </s>
So you can’t use false statements… Vernon… And you can’t just lie to people… “And , and the discount…” Vernon Briggs . </s>
“And the discount stores . It’ll , it’ll work this time.” </s>
And the reason… The reason that it…that illegal immigration failed during the 1950s was because we had this awful program called Operation Wetback in the early ‘50s , which was a massive roundup - of which nobody would defend on this side of , uh , of the , of the borders . </s>
And that we had a large number of illegal immigrants . When that program ended , because of the massive violation of civil rights , illegal immigration went down . And it wasn’t because we had…we introduced more visas . Well , illegal immigration… </s>
In other words , you are going to acquire… And it started going up , after the , the ‘60s . Your view requires massive roundups . And I’d actually like to know , from Enrique and Karen , do they support… ? We do . </s>
…another Bracero program ? Because that’s what he is talking about . These , these are… Roundup guest workers . </s>
Using that terminology , like Operation Wetback , actually deported a lot of U.S. citizens as well . </s>
That’s right . If you were Mexican , whether you were born in the United States or not , you were deported . And we have somebody here whose , whose , uh , Mom was in a detention facility during the Second World War . So we can not accept this type of , of , of , of a situation at all . </s>
And , and the guest worker program… Well , that’s what the program is calling for… When was the last time… ? </s>
That’s what the program is calling for… When was the last time you had a guest in your house and you said , “Now I want you to clean the bathroom and mow my lawn” ? Either you are a “guest , ” or you are a worker . </s>
So we need to have some sort of a humane program . </s>
We need to have some sort of a humane program which addresses this issue . Another thing that was mentioned about Mexico . It , it is true . We don’t have a border patrol , but the military is down in the southern border , partially funded by the United States , because they are trying to stop the flow right down there , be…before they get into , uh , Mexico . And it’s very important to note , that if the wall had been built from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico on September 10th…September 11th would have happened exactly the same way . </s>
One of the solutions that we should be doing is , is working with Mexico , creating bridges of communication , and not triple fences of separation . We know people who have come from the north , from Canada . </s>
Yet the National Guard , the wall , the Minutemen , they are on the southern border . So we need to be working… And I don’t want a wall up in the north , I don’t want a wall in the south . </s>
We need to be working with our neighbors , and treating them as neighbors , not as enemies . And that’s one of the things that we are looking for . Look at the European common Union , how they have gotten together and improved the economy of all of the countries . </s>
A rising tide raises all , all , all ships . And we need to do the same thing in helping… By enforcing the immigration law along the border . …in helping Latin America . </s>
And we send billions to the Middle East , and only millions to Latin America . Help Mexico and the other countries in Latin America develop , and the people will stay . We are still gon na need immigrants here , though . </s>
We are still gon na need it . All right . </s>
But let’s think about it intelligently . Not with all this rhetoric . </s>
Not with laughing about people dying at the border . I am the only one that’s here that’s at the border every day . Has seen dead bodies out there . Has picked them up . This is no laughing matter . </s>
Our people are dying . It’s inhumane . If the world… The world is watching us . OK . And they are saying , “How could this country allow them to build this wall , and attack a community in the land of the free.” </s>
Enrique Morones , thank you very much . But let me… </s>
But wait… </s>
I want to take another question from the audience . Uh , Judith Zucker , I believe , on the right side , Row H. Could you stand , please ? </s>
Judith ? </s>
OK . Yes , please . State your question . And , uh , direct it to who you would wish to answer it , please . </s>
And I believe I asked , uh , a question . _____ in this era of Homeland Security , when we are supposed to be keeping our country safe . Why is it that we have this immigration issue at such an extreme , uh , level at this point ? And the irony is very strange to me . Could I take a whack at that ? </s>
Please . Go ahead . Yeah , um… Mark Krikorian . The , the… The reason immigration policy is relevant to security now , is not just some opportunistic thing . </s>
“Well , 9/11 was a big deal , so let’s concoct some rationale based on ‘security’ to reduce immigration.” </s>
Kind of like these lobbyists for “farm subsidies” talk about “food security.” You know , “The , uh , uh , the terrorists are gon na …are , are trying to attack us , so we need subsidies for food security.” No , this is an integral… There is…there is a reason that immigration policy and security are related . Uh , years ago , World War II , they talked about “the homefront.” That was part of the government’s propaganda at the time , and I use that in a positive term…way . </s>
Um , and it was designed really… The , the use of the term “homefront” was to get people motivated to , you know , recycle their old tires and not grumble too much about butter rationing . But it wasn’t a real “front” ; it was a metaphor . Today , the homefront is not a metaphor anymore , as obviously we all know - it’s the actual front . Because of modern technology , modern transportation and communications and weapons technology , the homefront is the real front . And the number one defensive tool we have - not “offensive” tool , but “defensive” tool - is immigration control . </s>
And the fact that we have enormous levels of , uh , illegal immigration . Half of new immigration , mind you , each year’s… Half of each year’s immigration is illegal now . There is 800,000 illegal aliens settled here each year , plus 800,000 new legal immigrants coming from abroad . </s>
The fact that we permit this is an enormous vulnerability . Because any system that the Mexican illegal busboy can get through is something that a terrorist can get through . All right , Mark . Let’s…let’s focus on this… And the fact is that all of our borders have been used by terrorists . </s>
Let’s focus on that for just a second . I mean , Judith raises a point that sounds actually quite alarming . And you make the point that if it’s easy to walk into the United States , uh , under whatever pretense you want , um , that we are less secure . But what is the evidence that changing immigration policy will make us more secure ? What is the specific threat that will be eliminated ? </s>
And , and how does it specifically manifest itself in the immigrant population ? That I haven’t heard . Sure . </s>
Now , good question . Um , we looked actually , uh , after…after 9/11 , we looked at the 48 al-Qaeda related terrorists who had either committed criminal acts or who had been arrested before they were able to commit their crimes , starting with the first World Trade Center attack , finishing with 9/11 . And there were a lot in between - either smaller attacks , or conspiracies - that were , um , interrupted . And the majority of those people committed immigration violations . </s>
The fact is that a more , uh , vigorous , consistent , comprehensive enforcement of the immigration laws would have exposed probably - as far as we can tell - every single major terrorist conspiracy , uh , against the United States . Even when you look at 9/11 . </s>
The fact is that , four of the hijackers were - in some form or another - illegal aliens . And one of them came to study English , and then just never showed up , and there was no way for us to know . Uh , a couple had overstayed . </s>
One had overstayed earlier , and shouldn’t have been allowed back in but was . Others… One of them was an illegal alien and was stopped by the police for driving - whatever it was - 95 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone and nobody checked whether he was legal or illegal . </s>
So that… The fact is that , every major terrorist , uh , uh , conspiracy in the United States - every effort at attacking the United States has involved - must necessarily involve immigration law . And has - almost inevitably , and almost always will involve - violations of immigration law… John… </s>
…that if we detect… …can I respond to that ? …we can unravel… </s>
It’s a bunch of nonsense . Thank you , Mark Krikorian . Who is “they” ? Dan Griswold . </s>
Who is “they” ? They were born and raised right here… Dan… And we’ll get a response from Dan Griswold . </s>
And then you , Enrique . The last time I checked , not one of those 48 terrorists was a Mexican . They weren’t from Central America , they were from a particular part of the world , for historical reasons… Oh , so we discovered the Arabs first . </s>
OK . …and for historical reasons . Uh , they were not from Central America . None of them snuck across the Mexican border to get into the United States , and yet that was where we were obsessed with our resources . So we were basically guarding our back door , while the terrorists waltzed in through JFK through the front door . </s>
It’s not an immigration problem . </s>
You know , every day… Today was a typical day . One million people entered the United States . About a million foreigners a day enter the United States legally . The vast majority of them turn around and go home within 30 days or 60 days . </s>
That’s our vulnerability . And yet , we are sending these resources down there to catch dishwashers and roofers and people who have no criminal intentions , no criminal records . They just want to come here and work . </s>
And you talked about “interior enforcement.” </s>
Uh , again , what in the world are we spending all these resources going after businesses and peaceful , normal workers , when the real vulnerability are bridges and nuclear power plants and other infrastructure ? </s>
That’ why the raids tailed off so much in 2003 , it was because we were trying to guard our critical infrastructure . </s>
Well , I like McDonald’s , but it’s not critical infrastructure . </s>
If they want to hire a worker , I think they should be able to do , and we should create that legal channel . If we had a sensible legalization program , all these problems would be more manageable . We would be more secure , if our Homeland Security Department was going after the real criminals and terrorists… </s>
Oh , you want to abolish all employer sanctions . That’s all you want to do . …and not going after workers . Vernon Briggs . </s>
That’s what…that’s what you are saying . Uh , uh , uh , the reason we have these , these job sites - and these , these roundups and what have you - is because we have got a law that says they are not supposed to be there . And there are people that it have hurt . There are low wage workers - of all races and ethnic groups . </s>
I am not just concerned about Mexicans . I am concerned about people of all races - who are both illegal immigrants and those who are hurt in this country by the…by illegal immigration . You can not … You can not … It was Martin Luther King that said , “You can not legislate morality.” </s>
And once again , they are…they are using fear tactics - tactics of fear . As , as , uh , it was mentioned by Daniel - none of those people were from Latin America . Timothy McVeigh was born and raised in the United States . And there is countless other people - within this country - that have committed terrorist acts . Terrorism doesn’t come from a country ; it comes from an ideology . </s>
And it comes from the policies that has been exhibited - especially these last few years - in many cases , by this country…and people are reacting to it . Nobody supports terrorism in general . </s>
Nobody . We want to stop it . </s>
It’s horrible . We want to stop it coming . Is that it , Enrique ? It’s horrible what’s going on . But look at what happened with the Canadian border - with the , uh , the people that… The Millennium Bomber . </s>
People that… Toronto , a terrorist cell . These types of situations… We should be working with our neighboring countries , and intelligence - gathering an intelligence , working together . </s>
That’s the way that we solve these issues . </s>
Just stop blaming… Continuously they are blaming one country - Mexico . It’s not Mexico . It’s , it’s , it’s , it’s an ideology . And let’s start working together . It’s very important that we don’t succumb to these scare tactics… </s>
The reason… And that’s why you won’t address the question of undocumented workers . …and , and , and , and , and… What they are trying to do , is use the politics of fear . </s>
No . If , if you want… And many people in this audience are familiar with the politics of fear . </s>
If you look back in your history , the politics of , of fear was , uh , uh , one of the horriblest , uh , times in our history ; with the annihilation of so many different people… All right , Enrique . I want to move to one , because we are running… And I think that right now… </s>
…and we are running short on time here , and I want to get at least another… </s>
But I… Actually , I wouldn’t mind , but I… OK . Go ahead , Karen . </s>
Go ahead . Karen Narasaki . </s>
And I actually want to , uh , respond to the professor’s question and your earlier question , and that is , uh… In fact , there are some enforcement that we support . We just want it to work . And so , for example… Which ? </s>
If I could finish . For example , uh , you know , it… If we are going to have an employer system , uh , of checking - that’s great . But we need to have the database then be accurate . Because it’s a big thing not to be able to get a job , because somebody has fingered you . </s>
And if anybody has tried to go straighten out something with the government , you know it’s not an easy task . So we just want to have a system that’s gon na work , where people have the right to challenge . </s>
Where the government has an obligation to fix its database . Where employers… Where the sanctions are not so high , that employers are just going to randomly start to racial profile as a way to avoid the problem . </s>
And let me say . I mean , one of the things about driver’s licenses . California passed a law a while ago , saying we are not gon na give , uh , driver’s licenses to undocumented . Well , they started denying licenses to Puerto Ricans , because the people working at the DMV didn’t understand who the Puerto Ricans were . </s>
They thought - since they couldn’t produce a , um , a green card - that they were illegally here . We can not put those kinds of decisions…at that level . </s>
We need to have a more professional border enforcement . </s>
And we need more people . We need better training . Border enforcement is great , and let’s have a citizens commission to make sure it’s done humanely , and to make sure that , that , uh , people are being held accountable for how they act . All right . </s>
But the bottom line , illegal immigrants don’t work . That’s , that’s…that should be the principle . And if you would say that , I would go along with everything you said . But the bottom line of employer sanctions must be… What we are saying is…that illegal immigrants…do not work in the United States . That’s the law of the United States… since 1986… </s>
But can I tell you ? …because they don’t work . You , you were right… And you were right , that employer sanctions did not work in the ‘90s . Because there was a wink and a nod about really employers wanting them , and issues . </s>
Well , you know , the immigrant community has come to grips with that . </s>
And there was very hard negotiations between…with labor and Chamber of Commerce and businesses…that was brokered by Senator Obama…to come up with a system that works . That’s all people are asking for . All right . </s>
And we are reaching a… We are not saying “no enforcement.” …we are reaching a passionate point here in the question and answer . And I want to channel some of those passions into the summing up remarks of all of the , uh , panelists , who are going to give their final pitch for and against the resolution . Speaking now . </s>
And of course , remember , the margin of victory for the resolution in the vote before the debate… And we will have a chance to re-visit that vote at the conclusion of the final sum-up . But to conclude in the final rebuttal , against the resolution , Daniel Griswold will speak first . And those workers who come here illegally are not bad people . </s>
They are not “criminals” in the usual sense of the word . </s>
They are good , decent , hard-working family people who have run afoul of a very bad law that needs to be changed . You know , the , uh , the proposition here about “welcoming illegal immigrants.” Some welcome . </s>
If you want to come here , you have to pay a , a smuggler , a coyote , $ 2,000 , risk your life in the desert , and sometimes not make it and die a terrible death . Live a shadow existence here . Not having full employment opportunities . Not being able to go home and visit your family , uh , on holiday , because you may not get back into the country . </s>
Uh , that isn’t “welcoming” them . And these people may be low skilled , but they are not dumb . They’ll respond to incentives . If we give them an alternative - a legal alternative to the current dysfunctional system - I think they’ll obey the law and enter the country legally , as they did in the 1950s when we offered sufficient number of , uh , the Bursaro visas . Allow them to come in in a safe , orderly… </s>
One . </s>
…legal way , through our normal ports of entry , to assume all the responsibilities and privileges of working in our above ground economy . They love their country . Believe it or not , not everybody in the world wants to live in America . In fact , most people don’t . </s>
They love their country , they love their culture and their family , and they want to stay home . And traditionally , back when we had a kind of , uh , “don’t ask , don’t tell” policy of immigration for Mexico - most of them went back home , because that’s where their family is , and that’s where they want to go . Right now , we have a broken law that needs to be changed . </s>
I think we should welcome more legal immigrants , and that’s why I urge to vote against this resolution . Daniel Griswold , thank you very much , speaking against the resolution . Now , to speak for the resolution , in final rebuttal , Heather Mac Donald . </s>
Well , we have heard , I think , a lot of , uh , sleight of hand by the opposing team , which is to conflate illegal immigration and legal immigration . They basically have been debating a proposition that is not before us tonight , which is - we should continue welcoming legal immigration . </s>
All of our team member is for that . We agree that legal immigration is part of this country’s history . </s>
Uh , it is appropriate . It is , uh…it brings values . But , but one of the values that this country stands for , is the rule of law . Uh , if we continue to wink at illegal immigration , I think that we are cutting away at the fabric of what makes this country great . </s>
There is nothing “inhumane” about enforcing laws in a color-blind , fair manner . We have yet to do that . </s>
Uh , but it is not inherently… One . …“inhumane” to have an immigration law . We haven’t tried it . Uh , when we start , we will be sending a message to people that it is not right to come here . </s>
We are working with Mexico . Uh , we are giving them aid . </s>
We are working on the border . They have a responsibility . Other countries have a responsibility , it seems to me , to , to , to do something about their own economies , uh , which we are trying to help them with , and to prevent their citizens from trying to come into this country illegally . Uh , again , we are a great country , and part of that is the rule of law . </s>
And that currently , the system is broken . The thing to do is to start fixing it , by enforcing it . </s>
Thank you . Speaking for the resolution , Heather Mac Donald . Now to speak against the resolution , in final rebuttal , Karen Narasaki . </s>
All we are trying to debate tonight is , what kind of country do we want to be ? How do we want to enforce these laws ? Restrictionists , for example , object to allowing undocumented immigrants to have bank accounts and pay taxes . </s>
They say “that’s welcoming . ” Yet , without bank accounts , these immigrants are vulnerable to criminals who know to rob their businesses or invade their homes because they know they will find a lot of cash . And how does it help Americans to stop immigrants from being able to pay taxes to help cover their share of the cost of building roads or running schools ? </s>
Isn’t that one of the reasons restrictions give for what they feel is unfair about undocumented immigrants in the first place ? Which , by the way , do pay taxes . And in fact , in a recent study that was done on Long Island , for example , immigrants were paying much more of their share of taxes than they were actually using as benefits . So let’s jettison the old way of thinking , because it really hasn’t served our country well . </s>
Let’s ask ourselves… </s>
One . …do we want to be a country where we turn teachers and co-workers , ministers and nurses and neighbors into immigration police ? Or one where we have sense… sensible , realistic immigration flows , with a well-trained border enforcement agency , who are held accountable for following their own laws ? One that continues to hold agencies accountable for following the rules when they make decisions about people’s lives , or one that illuminates the systems of checks and balances and sacrifices due process along the way ? </s>
If you vote for our side , it’s because you believe that it’s time for us to stop scapegoating immigrants , and instead focus on how do we fix the real problems ? How do we fix the push that pushes immigrants here ? And what do we do with immigrants once they are here , to make sure that our communities are healthy and thriving , and that we continue to be able to compete well in the global marketplace . Thank you . Thank you . </s>
Karen Narasaki speaking against the resolution . Now to speak for the resolution , in final rebuttal , Vernon Briggs . Uh , the current situation we have , of massive user immigration system , breeds widespread cynicism throughout the country by illegals and by citizens about what are American values ? Illegal immigrants know they are exploited , but they have no choice but to take the jobs that are offered to them ; they are still better what they had where they came from . Citizens are appalled with the lack of concern by their own government… country , uh , on the…about the unfairness of the competition that low wage workers are confronting with the presence of illegal immigrations . </s>
Perversely , we has set up a system , where those lawyers - uh , sorry - where those employers who try to follow the immigration , uh , laws of the United States are , are…or who , uh , or law… are put at a competitive disadvantage by firms that are allowed to violate the laws and can under , uh , uh…underbid them and under…and undersell them in the labor market . Currently , by the way , because we don’t enforce our immigration laws , we are , we are basically , well , rewarding law breaking…and , uh , and those who follow the law , they are actually punished . </s>
Many years ago , the famous CBS correspondent Edward R. Murrow said , “The duty of journalists is to separate slogans from policies.” One . </s>
I think that’s the duty of scholars also . Tonight , we have heard a lot of slogans from the other side , but no policies . Our position is one of clear policy - not slogans about “scapegoating” and “nation of immigrations” and “who we are as Americans” and all that . We are talking basically here about policy . </s>
That if we could…if we could actually begin to enforce our immigration policies , we could then turn to the real issues of what’s pushing people out of these countries , that I would love to discuss . And those are the big issues . But we can’t get to those issues - human rights violations , uh , population pressures , unfair trade policies and all the rest of them - because the system is so out of kilter , because we don’t enforce our immigration laws . We desperately need to do so . </s>
The Jordan Commission said , the credibility of the immigration policy can be measured by a simple yardstick . Do people who get in , uh - who should get in , do get in ? The people who should not get in are kept out . And the people who are deportable - are required to leave . </s>
That’s Barbara Jordan . No racist . </s>
And it can’t be said any clearer . Thank you , Vernon Briggs . Before our last two speakers , let me remind you of the motion . Let’s Stop Welcoming Undocumented Immigrants . </s>
Our final speaker , against the motion , Enrique Morones . Well , thank you all very much . And I want to pass on my , my love and my , uh , support to , uh , the fact that , that we are all here today . And , and I appreciate the fact that we would going to be able to debate this . </s>
Remember that , um… What right do we have to deny anybody to have a better life ? What right do we have ? We want a… We have a solution that six… Like , three and a half million people demonstrated when they marched in the streets last spring . </s>
Like , 65 percent of the country , according to a Gallup Poll , supports it . </s>
It’s comprehensive and humane immigration reform . </s>
I , I , I keep on repeating this . Many of you , in your history , are familiar with the politics of hate . </s>
Shouldn’t somebody have stepped in and said , “We have got to stop this ? ” Love is in action , and not in words . It’s important that we go and , and demonstrate the best of America . </s>
The best of America - the diversity . </s>
The whole world used to hold us up and look at us and say , “That’s what we strive to be.” That’s not taking place right now . We want to get back to that . </s>
And we can . Sleight of hand . </s>
Well , the sources that I have are Business Week , the Wall Street Journal , the Good Book . And I am talking about serious… One . …serious , uh , documentation , and not using this type of rhetoric , this type of dehumanizing language , which only promotes the politics of fear . We want to have the rule of law . </s>
I believe in a , in a law from , uh , above - but I also believe in the laws of a country . But remember , sometimes laws are wrong . </s>
And we had slaves in this country , and that was a law . Women could not vote , that was a law . Child labor , that was a law . </s>
Somebody had to stand up and say , “This is wrong.” And that’s why it’s important that you vote against this motion . </s>
It’s wrong what is taking place . And we have a lot of work to do . There is not easy solutions . But you have got to look at yourself in the mirror and say , “Hey , I did the right thing.” </s>
When your grandkids ask you , “What did you do when all those people were dying , when the families were being raided , what did you do ? Did you do the right thing ? ” </s>
And let’s build a better America . And it’s the immigrants that build a better America . Give those people a humane way in which to enter , and not die at the border - as two people per day are dying . Two people died today . We can not continue to allow this to happen . </s>
We have a lot of work to do - a lot of work to do within this country . </s>
It’s a great and generous country . </s>
Enrique Morones… Let’s practice what we preach . …speaking against the motion . Thank you very much . Our final speaker , in rebuttal , for the motion , Mark Krikorian . </s>
And I am a bad person . I would love to debate what the level of legal immigration should be , how we should organize it , who we should pick , who we should not . In fact , I have a book coming out in the summer that , uh , addresses that very question from Sentinel , available in July . </s>
Um , but that’s… </s>
But you are a bad person . That’s not the debate before us , though . The question really we are facing , for our purposes tonight is , are we willing to enforce the law ? </s>
We have a heard a lot of “if’s” and “would’s” and “should’s” and “need to’s” from the other side about enforcement . But I think we all understand that if the Bush amnesty bill that was debated in the Senate this summer had passed , that , um , the commitment to enforcement would last only until the last illegal alien in line got his green card - at which point it would just , like in 1986 , evaporate . And a few years after that… One . </s>
…we would have a burgeoning illegal population , because the market does not determine illegal immigration - our policies do , in large part - and we would have the same debate , saying “We need to have realistic laws that legalize all the next batch of illegal immigrants.” </s>
We need to decide - are we willing to enforce the borders of the United States and the laws determined by the American people through their elected representatives - or do we want , in effect , to abolish American sovereignty and embrace the , say , E.U . or other , uh , model that the other side has used…where we , the American people , no longer decide what our immigration policy is . Thank you , Mark Krikorian . It is now time to vote . </s>
The motion before the House : Let’s Stop Welcoming Undocumented Immigrants . Once again , pick up the keypad attached to the left armrest on your seat . </s>
And after my prompt , press “1” if you are for the motion , “2” if you are against the motion , or “3” if you are undecided . All right . Please cast your vote now . Thank you , voters . Thank you , audience . </s>
And I want to thank the debaters and the audience for their good work . This is a terrific discussion . Much , much more to discuss . Before I announce the results of the audience vote , I want to , uh , take care of just a few things up here . The next Intelligence Squared U.S. debate will be on Tuesday , October 30th , right here at Asia Society and Museum . </s>
The motion to be debated at that time is - is Russia… ? “Russia is becoming our enemy again.” That’s the motion . And it will be moderated by the Economist’s Edward Lucas . The panelists for the next debate are : For the motion , Staff Journalist in Residence at the Foundation for Defense of Democracy’s Claudia Rosett ; Foreign Affairs columnist for the Wall Street Journal Bret Stephens ; and the Annenberg Chair in International Communication at the Institute for World Politics , J. Michael Waller . </s>
Again the motion will be speaking : Professor of International Affairs at the New School , Nina Khrushcheva ; Professor of Political Science at Columbia University Robert Legvold ; and Vice President for Studies of Russia , China and Eurasia at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , Mark Medish . I know that many of you that were here tonight will be very interested in that debate , and please join us for that . An edited version of tonight’s Intelligence Squared U.S. debate can be heard locally on WNYC-AM 820 , on Sunday , October 21st , at 8:00 P.M . Please check your local NPR member station listings for the dates and times of broadcast outside of New York City . Mark , you didn’t even let me , and I had to plug all ready for you . </s>
And copies of , uh , books of the panelists… Vernon Briggs’ book Mass Immigration in the National Interest , Heather Mac Donald’s The Immigration Solution , are on sale upstairs in the lobby . And you can also purchase DVD’s from previous debates here tonight , or from the Intelligence Squared U.S. website . And now , the debate results . After our debaters did their best to sway you , you voted… Uh , before the debate , you voted 42 percent for . </s>
After the debate , 60 percent for the motion . Before the debate , 34 percent against the motion . </s>
After the debate , 37 percent against the motion . Before the debate , 24 percent of you were undecided . After the debate , 3 percent were undecided . Congratulations to those supporting the resolution . </s>
Yeah , and thank you . The House is adjourned . Thank you very much . </s>
I am John Hockenberry . Robert Rosenkranz : Well thank you so much for joining us tonight . When these debates started four years ago , our first resolution was , `` We must tolerate a nuclear Iran . '' Well this could well be the year that Iran gets the bomb . And our government 's actions suggest that it is voting for the motion . </s>
Israel on the other hand , might quite rationally decide it can not tolerate a nuclear Iran and take military action to prevent it . </s>
This is the perhaps the most dramatic and consequential way U.S. and Israeli policy may diverge . But there are many others . Israel 's priority is its own security , full stop . </s>
The U.S. is committed to Israeli security , but it has many conflicting priorities , keeping control of Middle East oil out of the hands of Jihadi extremists for one , encouraging the recycling of petro dollars into our vulnerable economy , strengthening ties with moderate Arab regimes , avoiding nuclear proliferation in the region . U.S. objectives might well be advanced by Israeli-Palestinian or Israeli-Syrian accords on terms Israel does n't like very much at all . </s>
On the other hand , the special relationship has deepened profound roots . </s>
Some is value-driven , reverends for the Holy Land by American Jews and Christians alike , respect for Israel 's democratic institutions . </s>
But some is highly strategic . Israel is our closest friend and ally in the Middle East . It has , by far , the greatest military capability in the region , and is a major source of intelligence . And getting back to a nuclear Iran , Israel might well be our best shield . </s>
Israel did the U.S. , in the region , a favor , I would argue , by bombing the Syrian reactor . Maybe it will do the dirty work again so we do n't have to tolerate a nuclear Iran . </s>
Against this complex backdrop , can we say that by holding hands with Israel , America is shooting itself in the foot ? Should America step back from its special relationship ? Tonight 's debate is to provide some light on this vital issue , and it will surely provide lots of heat . </s>
So it 's my pleasure at this point to turn the proceedings over to our moderator John Donvan and the stellar group of panelists who are going to debate this resolution . </s>
Thank you . </s>
John Donvan : Thank you . I 'd just like to invite one more round of applause for the gentleman who makes all of these debates possible , Robert Rosenkranz . Welcome , everyone , to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S.. I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . And once again , it 's my honor to serve as moderator . As the floor debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . </s>
Four debaters , two at each table , are debating this motion , `` The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel . '' </s>
And I want to point out , this is a debate . It 's not a panel discussion . It is not a seminar . This is a debate . </s>
It 's a contest , with winners and losers . And you in our audience have the special role of choosing our winners . You are the judges in this debate . And by the time the evening has ended , you will have voted twice , once before and once after the debate on whether you agree or disagree with the motion , especially after what you 've heard . </s>
And the team that has changed the most minds at the end of the debate will be declared our winner . So let 's go on to our first round of voting . Once again , the keypads to your seats are your means to do that . If you agree with our motion , `` The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel '' , you 're to push number one . If you disagree , a `` No '' is number two . </s>
If at this point , you 're undecided that 's number three . You can ignore the other numbers . And if you make a mistake , just correct it and the system will record your last entered number . So we 'll have the results of that vote quite shortly . We go in three rounds . </s>
We have opening statements of approximately seven minutes each . Then we go on to a middle section where the debaters talk directly to one another , prompted also by questions from myself and from you in the audience . </s>
And then at the end of the evening , each team has two minutes of closing remarks . On to round one then , let the debate begin . Our first debater , for the motion , `` The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel '' , is Roger Cohen who will make his way to his lectern . Roger is a former foreign editor of The New York Times , a journalist who has traveled the world , who has himself the interesting story , you are Cohen , because when your dad left South Africa and moved to the UK , he was advised that it will be a good idea to change his name from Cohen . </s>
And his answer was - Roger Cohen : His answer was - he suggested maybe Einstein . </s>
He stuck with Cohen and it worked . John Donvan : That 's why tonight , I brought you Cohen , arguing for the motion , `` The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel . '' Roger Cohen : Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . </s>
In life , when we fail , we call it stupidity to burrow deeper into failure . Measured by any standard , American policy toward Israel has failed over the past couple of decades . We are no closer to any kind of peace . Israelis and Palestinians today stand further apart than ever . </s>
They are estranged . </s>
They are mistrustful . They are antagonistic . They can scarcely even imagine peace . We will therefore submit to you tonight that rather than burrowing deeper into failure , and so jeopardizing American interest , the United States should reconsider its ties with Israel . </s>
It should step back from its special relationship in favor of a normal relationship . Now a normal relations between allies , and the United States and Israel must remain firm allies , are often marked by differences . </s>
With France , with Japan , with Germany , with Turkey , important allies all , America has regular and often open disagreements . </s>
What makes America 's relationship with Israel is its uncritical nature , even when U.S. interests are being hurt . What also makes the relationship special is the incredible largess that the United States shows towards Israel , over the past decade , $ 28.9 billion in economic aid . And on top of that , another $ 30 billion in military aid , that 's almost $ 60 billion . </s>
That 's 10 times the GNP of Haiti that is being gifted to a small country . Now , I ask you , to what end is this money being used . Ladies and gentlemen , we would submit that it ends often inimical to the America interest . </s>
Take the ongoing Israeli settlement program in the West Bank , at a cost of about $ 100 billion , this enterprise has grown the number of settlers in the West Bank from about 140,000 in 1996 , to about 300,000 today . </s>
If you add the roughly 150,000 Israeli 's in East Jerusalem , you get to a number of 450,000 Israelis beyond the 1997 border . That 's not all . Money has poured into a repressive apparatus involving settler-only highways , reserved military areas , a separation or security barrier . The Israelis call it `` separation wall '' , `` hated separated wall '' the Palestinians call it , a barrier that burrows into the West Bank and annexes 10 % of the land . </s>
What 's the result of this ? Well the result is an isolated , fragmented , atomized , fractured , humiliated Palestinian presence that simply makes a nonsense , at first , of the notion of `` Two States for Two Peoples '' . What I observe there on my visits to the West Bank amounts to a kind of primer in colonialism . Imagine , Israelis in their fast cars , Blackberry-ing away , booming down these super highways , while Palestinians on their donkey carts make their way on dirt tracks , if they can get there , to their orchards . This is a primer in colonialism , much more than it resembles a nascent Palestinian state . </s>
Yet , `` Two States for Two Peoples '' is the declared U.S. objective . In effect , the United States is bankrolling the very Israeli policies that are dashing its own aims and the hopes for Oslo by making two states almost unimaginable . </s>
Does this make sense ? Is that clever ? I do n't think so . And if you do n't think so , ladies and gentlemen , you should vote for the proposition tonight . </s>
Now , the United States has raised its voice occasionally . Jim Baker , for example , Secretary of State in '89 , said , `` Foreswear annexation . </s>
Stop settlement activity . '' Now fast forward two decades to Barack Obama , in Cairo , two decades in several hundred thousand settlers , he said , `` The United States does not accept legitimacy of the continued Israeli settlements . '' And what did Prime Minister Netanyahu do two weeks ago , planted settlings in various settlements , and they are part - and said , `` They are part of Israel for all eternity . '' </s>
Now in a normal relationship , there would be consequences to such defiance . In a special relationship , the one that exists , there are no such consequences . Now , America 's perceived complicity in Israeli violence carries a heavy price . </s>
Jihadi terrorism aimed at the United States is not primarily motivated perhaps by the Palestinian issue , but it is a major factor . </s>
It is a potent terrorist recruitment tool . The United States should stand by its allies . And Israel is an ally . </s>
But if America is to pay the blood , and the treasure , and the last piece of mind that comes with supporting Israel , it should be ready at least to speak openly and critically of Israeli mistakes when needed . To boost , ladies and gentlemen , are unhealthy , a climate that affixes charges of anti-Semitism to anyone critical of Israel , and self-hating Jew to any Jew who 's critical of Israel , is unhelpful . </s>
For if there are not two states , there will be one state . And sooner or later , the number of Palestinians in it will outnumber the number of Jews . And what then will remain of the Zionist dream ? Ladies and gentlemen , there 's also a moral issue here . </s>
I am a Jew . I know that Israel at its foundation and its declaration of independence said it would , `` Ensure complete equality of social and political rights to all its inhabitants , irrespective of religion , race , and sex . '' We , Jews , know in our bones what persecution is . </s>
Alas , and this is hard to say , Israel , has in my view , lost touch with these fundamental values . By uncritically supporting Israeli policies in the West Bank and Gaza , America is undermining its own values , which at the very least stand for the absence of second class citizenship and equality of opportunity . Yes , I know Israel 's a vibrant democracy isolated in the Middle East . And its values are closer to ours than those at closed Arab societies . </s>
But that does not mean that we should endorse Israel 's systematic dismemberment of the Two State option . And if President Obama is serious about reaching out to the Muslim world , America must appear much more as an honest broker and less as Israel 's spokesman . </s>
And that requires a serious re-balloting . You will , I suspect , hear that Israel is a lonely David facing an Arab Goliath . You will hear that it needs blanket American support to be secure . This is simply not true . Nuclear-armed Israel is powerful . </s>
John Donvan : Roger Cohen , your time is up . Roger Cohen : The United States can step back while ensuring Israel 's security . And so I urge you to vote for the motion tonight . Thank you . John Donvan : Thank you , Roger Cohen . </s>
Our motion is , `` The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel '' , and arguing first against the motion , Stuart Eizenstat , who has been a former ambassador to the European Union , but his career in government is astounding . When you go through his resume , he has had undersecretary positions in Commerce , in Treasury , in the State Department . You did n't get Agriculture ? </s>
Not a farmer , ladies and gentlemen , Stuart Eizenstat . Stuart Eizenstat : Thank you , John . I could n't disagree more with Roger Cohen , and strongly oppose the notion that the United States should somehow stand back from its special relationship with Israel , and I do so for the following reasons . First , if the United States would do so , it would betray the very principles upon which U.S. foreign policy is based . Unlike China , or Russia , or some of our European allies , our foreign policies since our founding founders have never been to avoid a morality . </s>
Indeed , morality is a central feature of our policy . As a first country to recognize Israel in 1947 after the Holocaust as a refuge for Jews , we would be betraying those principles were we to step back from the special relationship we 've developed over 62 years . </s>
Second , it would mean abandoning the only democratic , loyal , reliable ally in the region , which shares American values of democracy , rights for women , judicial independence , freedom of speech , and forming a 21st century culture . </s>
It 's the only state in the region , which has a vibrant non-governmental sector so good on policies that Roger mentioned . There are groups like Peace Now , B’Tselem , and others who are vibrantly and publicly opposing those policies , the only country in the region which permits that kind of debate and criticism of the government . In addition , it 's not just American values , it is American interest . </s>
Israel shares American interest in combating terrorism , in creating pro-Western moderate Arab states in the region , in stopping nuclear proliferation , and in having peace with all of its neighbors . </s>
In addition , if we were to withdraw that special relationship , it would be a sign of American inconstancy and weakness . What message would it send to other allies ? Would they think they were going to be next on the chopping block ? </s>
And indeed , to do so would only lead to more demands from those in the region . America has to stand behind its allies because if it does n't , it will not have many left anywhere . In addition , the whole notion of this motion misunderstands the major issues facing the United States in the region . </s>
And I have spent an enormous amount of time and energy in that region in multiple capacities . Issues that we have with Iraq and Afghanistan , Pakistan and Iran , terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda are unrelated to our special relationship with Israel . </s>
Indeed , what is going on fundamentally in these states is a contest internally within the Arab world between modernizing states and radical Islamic states who want to create an Islamic caliphate for the whole region , unrelated to Israel , unrelated to Israel . It 's also auspicious argument that somehow there 's a zero-sum game that the kind of outreach that President Obama properly is providing to the Muslim world is somehow inconsistent with a special relationship with Israel . And let me tell you from personal knowledge , there is no zero-sum game . We can , and do have , both . </s>
We have a very close relationship . And I spent a lot of time in countries like Egypt and in Jordan , and in the territories , and in the Gulf helping build that relationship . </s>
And indeed , let me point out that it is because of the special relationship with Israel that the Arab states know that the way in which Israel will make concessions is when it has a dependable American ally so that it can make those territorial concessions . And I 've seen it happen at Camp David under President Carter , all of Sinai given back . I 've seen it happen with Jordan and the peace agreement with Jordan . </s>
Roger says there 's been no peace . I mean , I do n't know where you 've been . </s>
How about the Egyptian peace , which has lasted now for over 30 years , and the Jordanian peace ? </s>
And those concessions continued . For example , Prime Minister Barack in the Clinton administration , in which I served at the second Camp David , offered 95 % of the land , including East Jerusalem , to Yasser Arafat . And what was the response ? </s>
No , that 's where the second intifada occurred . </s>
What was the response when Israel unilaterally withdrew from Gaza ? </s>
What was the response ? Rockets from Gaza , dismantling the settlements , dismantling 3,000 people , and that was the response . So it is auspicious argument that we can only have good relations with the Muslim world if we abandon Israel . Indeed , they know we need to have that relationship to convince Israel to make those concessions . </s>
In addition , where else will one have a special relationship and with whom else ? The Saudis ? </s>
The Saudis who export Wahabanism as well as expensive oil from whom 17 of the 19 9/11 terrorists came ? </s>
Would it be Egypt where I 've spent a great deal of time ? I think we need stronger relations with Israel . It 's on forth with Egypt . It 's a one-party state , 28 years the same president . </s>
The opposition candidate was arrested when he ran against Mr. Mubarak . Afghanistan , Pakistan , Lebanon , where is the special relationship ? And let me close with this thought , when you say , `` Why do n't we have peace with the Palestinians ? '' If there were a Martin Luther King , if there were a Mahatma Gandhi leading the Palestinian movement , they would have had statehood long , long , long ago . </s>
It is because there is no reliable Palestinian partner . It is because of the Hamas-Fatah problem . It is because when the Israeli public sees a withdrawal from Lebanon or a withdrawal on their own from Gaza , instead of reconciliation , they get rockets in response . </s>
That 's why we do n't have peace , not because Israel does n't want peace . </s>
And last , there are certain things with which we disagree with Israel as we do with all allies , settlement policy and so forth . I did n't notice , for example , that Germany , or the UK , or France is providing the kind of troops we want in Afghanistan . You can have a special relationship with allies and not always agree . Therefore , I strongly urge you to vote against this pernicious motion , which would undercut the very basis of foreign policy in the United States . </s>
John Donvan : Stuart Eizenstat , your time is up . </s>
Stuart Eizenstat : The only bipartisan foreign policy which we have in this country . Thank you . </s>
John Donvan : All right . Here 's where we are . We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News serving as moderator . We have two teams of two facing it out over this motion , `` The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel '' . </s>
You 've heard the first two debaters . Now we move on to the third . I 'd like to introduce Rashid Khalidi who is a professor at Columbia University , a former adviser to the Palestinian delegation for the Arab-Israeli peace negotiations . </s>
He was in Beirut during the Israeli bombing in 1982 . He comes from - New York born , comes from a storied Jerusalem family who has bequeathed to the city of Jerusalem one of the world 's leading libraries of Islamic literature , started by your grandfather , I believe ? </s>
Rashid Khalidi : Yes . </s>
John Donvan : Ladies and gentlemen , Rashid Khalidi . Rashid Khalidi : Good evening , ladies and gentlemen . </s>
Thank you for braving the impending snowstorm . </s>
You 've heard from our opponents , one of our opponents , a pattern that we 've heard a great deal of . </s>
And if you listen to the advocates of the special relationship with Israel , you would think that all is for the best and the best of all possible worlds . </s>
Well I 'm here to tell you that it 's not . You heard from my colleague , Roger , exactly how bad the situation is . I strongly recommend the next time any of you have a chance to go to the Holy Land , that you take a little time away from your trip to Israel and spend some time in the West Bank , spend three or four days . And you will see precisely how bad it is . </s>
Now , I would be the last person , as a Middle East historian , to suggest that all the problems in the Middle East are caused by the U.S. special relationship with Israel . They 're not . There are problems with Arab governments . </s>
There are problems among the Palestinians . There are problems inside Israel . But some problems are caused by this special relationship . Let me just list a couple of them . One of them is that there is , as a result in large measure of our special relationship with Israel , an almost total deafness to public opinion in Palestine and in the Arab world . </s>
We hear the same kind of mantra about there 's no democracy , there 's no public sector . There are all kinds of things going on in public opinion in the Arab world . And one of the things that 's going on is a deep distrust and unease with U.S. policy over this issue in particular . </s>
A second thing that has to be said is that there is a suspicion , in public opinion in particular all over the Arab world , of the fact that the United States in the Middle East because of this special relationship is not and can not be an honest broker . Everybody knows that the United States engages in prior coordination with Israel , as a result of an agreement made by Secretary Kissinger back in the 70s , before anything starts between Arabs and Israelis . Everybody knows , in other words , that there 's a big fat U.S. thumb on the scales when the United States act as a mediator . </s>
I recall , in the negotiations in Washington , we were in an impasse with the Israeli side , and we were told , after much reluctance on their part , that the State Department of the United States would come with a bridging proposal . We were very pleased . They came with a bridging proposal that was worse than the position that the Israelis had offered us . This is what the special relationship gives you . </s>
It gives you a country that can not act as an honest broker . </s>
And let me say something about United States reliability . Let me say something about what the United States looks like after 20 years when American presidents , since President Carter , have said not just that they were going to make peace with Egypt , which they did , but that they were going to make peace between the Palestinians and the Israelis . We have systematically failed in this effort over the past 20 years . The situation is - 30 years in fact . </s>
The situation is infinitely worse today than when Ambassador Rabinovich and I went to Madrid in October of 1991 . It 's worse for the Palestinians . It 's worse for the position the United States in the Arab world if you care not what autocratic governments think , but what the people think about us . </s>
And this brings me to the main reason you should vote for this proposition . </s>
You should vote for this proposition , in our opinion , because the United States should be true to its principles . It should be fair . </s>
It should be equitable . It should be just . We give , as Roger said , $ 60 billion over the past 10 years to Israel . We are in effect engaged in supporting an occupation that has been going on for 42 years and counting . We are in effect underwriting settlements . </s>
And we 're not just using that with U.S. money that 's fund - U.S. tax dollars out of our pockets that 's fungible . We are doing that with tax deductible contributions to settlements , to projects in the occupied West Bank , and essentially to doing things that are directly opposed to United States policy and to the interest of the United States not to speak of the interest of peace in the Middle East . </s>
We hear a great deal about security whenever Israel is talked about . We have to be concerned with Israel 's security . Fine , we have to be concerned with the security of everybody in this region if we are going to be an honest broker , if some people are not of a higher importance to us than other people . </s>
What about the security of Palestinians ? In the recent war in Gaza , it was n't really a war . It was a one-sided affair . </s>
There were 14,000 people killed on one side and 14 on the other side . If we 're concerned with human security , we should be concerned with numbers like this . We should be concerned with the fact that everybody knows that we are engaged not just in funding , financing , supporting diplomatically , but also in selling weapons that are engaged in doing these kinds of things . </s>
Now what can the United States do ? </s>
In my view , it can do many things . </s>
It 's not enough to say , `` Oh , it 's a shame . The Palestinians are divided . '' The Palestinians are divided . They have deep , deep internal divisions . </s>
The United States has been working systematically to deepen those divisions . </s>
The United States should be helping to unite the Palestinians around a consensus whereby they can come forward and negotiate , rather than trying to keep them divided as we 've been trying to do if our objective is not to weaken them , which is an Israeli objective . If our objective is peace , then there has to be not just an Israeli consensus for peace , there has to be a Palestinian consensus for peace . </s>
We have done everything possible to prevent this . This is one thing that we can and should do . What else can we do ? I would argue that our policy should be linked not solely to what the stronger party - by far the stronger party in this relationship wants . </s>
That is no way to make peace . Again and again , what the United States has an effect done is to help gang up on the Palestinians . The United States has to pull away from this special relationship with Israel if it is to play any kind of effective role in making peace . Now , this is particularly true because the hardest issues between the Palestinians and the Israelis , much harder than anything that had to be dealt with between Israel and Jordan or Israel and Egypt have to do with issues that resonate all over the Arab world , things like refugees , things like Jerusalem . </s>
These are not easy issues . If we stand with the stronger , as we have done consistently on these and other issues , if we stand with Israel and ignore the fact that these are not just things on which there 's a claim on both sides , but most importantly , these are things that will negatively affect U.S. interests . If we take a one-sided position , we are harming U.S. interests throughout the region . If you vote against this proposition , I would argue , you are voting for the status quo . You are voting for more of the same . </s>
You are voting for a peace process that has delivered a lot of process and no peace . And that is what we have gotten from every administration up to this point . We have peace with Egypt . We have with Jordan . Peace with the Palestinians is much farther away . </s>
I would suggest that voting for this status quo is to say in effect , `` We 're going to bury our heads in the sand . We 're going to allow a Two States solution to disappear . '' I personally do n't think it has very many changes anymore . But if this is something that is important , if we do not want the future for Israel that many Israelis see , where Israel continues to rule over the Palestinians , we should vote in favor of this proposition . Thank you very much . </s>
John Donvan : Our motion is , `` The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel '' . </s>
And our last debater , arguing against this motion , Itamar Rabinovich is a former Israeli Ambassador to the United States . </s>
He was on the White House lawn when Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat shook hands . </s>
He has seen what he felt Israeli locations peace come here . His book on `` The Brink of Peace '' was about his involvement in negotiations with the Syrians . </s>
It went to the brink , and then pulled back . Ladies and gentlemen , Itamar Rabinovich . Itamar Rabinovich : Thank you . </s>
I urge you strongly to vote against the motion . I think that the motion indicates a desire to destroy the United States ' most important , most successful relationship in a very important part of the world . What does special relationship mean ? It does not mean that the tail is wagging the dog . It is a mutual relationship . </s>
I was an ambassador to Washington for nearly four years . I was a peace negotiator that worked very closely with the United States peace team . </s>
And I know how many disagreements we have had over the years with our American colleagues . How many times , what we call , pressure was brought to bear on Israeli decision makers , even presidents who were considered very friendly . Bill Clinton , considered a great friend of Israel , he was a close friend of Yitzhak Rabin . He admired Rabin , but I 've seen them argue fiercely . </s>
And I 've seen Rabin yield to Clinton because he was the President of the United States , the senior partner in this special relationship . </s>
Now , what is special about the relationship ? It 's special . It 's unique because you have unusual loyalty on both sides . </s>
We have many relationships around the world as we have mentioned . </s>
Israel relationship with France is so close . Does n't France undermine U.S. interests and policies in parts of the world ? Japan is a close ally , look at the arguments you 're having with Japan over stationing of U.S. troops in Japan . You will not have such an argument with Israel because there are no U.S. troops stationed in Israel . It 's a very close military and strategic alliance defined , among other things , by the fact that Israel does not want American troops to be stationed in Israel . </s>
Israel wants to look out for its own security with American help , with American weapons and equipment , but on its own , and not having to station troops in Israel or in that part of the Middle East because Israel is there , it 's a huge advantage . Because look at the other side of the Middle East , an important part of the Middle East , the Persian Gulf , Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Iran , countries that are of enormous influence or importance for the United States . You have troops there . </s>
You have many American troops at a huge cost in Iraq . You have troops in Afghanistan . You have troops stationed in Saudi Arabia . And remember , what did the Al- Qaeda terrorists say once they exploded into the World Trade Center , the first reason they cited for the U.S. - for attacking the U.S. is that the United States has troops on sacred Muslim soil in the Arabian peninsula . In Israel or near Israel , you do n't need to station U.S. troops . </s>
It 's a very close alliance . It 's an alliance based on mutuality , on a full loyalty on both sides , acceptance of , of course , the seniority of the United States in that relationship . And this relationship serves you in an area in which many American interests are focused . Now , the argument of the people who put this for a vote , the argument of our opponents in this debate is that support to Israel undermines American position in our republic opinion and reinforces Arab and Muslim tendency to terrorism against the United States . Wrong . </s>
What the Arabs resent most is , that is American military presence , American support for dictatorial regimes . Let me read a very perceptive comment written awhile ago . Iraq has changed everything in Washington , the city obsessed with the President . It was easy to forget that as recently as a few years ago , the United States was not particularly disliked in the Middle East , and that Al-Qaeda was a tiny underground organization with almost no popular support , very perceptive professor Khalidi who wrote these lines . </s>
So we are in agreement on a few things but we take different conclusions from that . So another complaint that I have against our opponents in this debate , first of all too much was focused on the Palestinian issue . It 's very important issue , it 's important first and foremost for us . </s>
I 'm one of those Israelis who desperately believe in fight for having a two state solution . I think it 's dangerous for Israel to keep the states poor . </s>
Now there are people in Israel who think otherwise and politically we disagree . In the United States and this Government of Israel do want to see a two state solution . But the President problem is not the only one . </s>
He said there is peace with Egypt , there is peace with Jordan and normal relations with quite a few Arab countries and that has been achieved by the United States precisely as my colleague Stu Eizenstat said , because the United States is the power , the great power that has the ability to influence to work with Israel . And Arab countries who want to see a change . Syria if it wants the Golan back knows that their road to the Golan leads to Washington , not through Tehran . So , actually the closest to Israel , the perception in the Arab world that the United States has that sway with Israel is one of the most important assets that United States has . </s>
And believe me I spent hundreds of hours talking to the Syrians as the peace negotiator with Syria , and I know exactly full well . They wanted to make peace with Israel because that was a pathway to Washington . They work with Washington , you know , that to make peace with Israel . Finally much of what you heard from our opponents earlier this evening was actually in the frame of the Bush years . We are not in the Bush years any more . </s>
For year there has been another administration in Washington and actually what we have seen it was President Obama who listened to such advice and begun by taking some distance from Israel . He went to Cairo ; he gave the speech to the Muslim world . He did n't go to Israel . </s>
What is the result , the result is the current impulse . </s>
It was a mistake to take even one step , because the voices that we heard from the Arab world was you took one step go all the way , that is a mistake . </s>
So the policy should be stay with the special relationship with Israel and together with Israel , use it in order to make peace with the Middle East including with the Palestinians . John Donvan : And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being argued is the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel . And we now have the results of our live audience vote . We asked you before the debate begun where you stood on our motion the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel before the debate began here is word stood 33 % of you were for the motion , 42 % against and 25 % were undecided . </s>
Now one to round two , ended round two the debaters is going to address one another directly . I will asks some questions of them and we will come to you and the audience to ask the questions and I once again want to urge you very much like a participation but we ask you to think in terms of the question , think in terms of something that you can say in 40 seconds , think in terms of something has question mark in the end and that is also on topic . </s>
But I where I want to begin this , I want to go to the side that is arguing against the motion which argued in part particularly Stuart Eizenstat who served in so many administrations and was involve in this region . Argued that turning away from Israel at this point would be an immoral act because Israel has been such a loyal ally for so long and I want to put to that side to either gentleman the question . </s>
So what would actually happen to Israel if the U.S. created more distance ? </s>
Stuart Eizenstat : Well , what would happen is that the United States would lose the levers and influence it has , and it has used to encourage Israel to make the concessions that it is made . </s>
It 's inconceivable for example that Israel would have given up all the sign at Camp David one with President Carter to each . If it did n't know that the United States was solidly and affirmably in its corner and the same is true with respect to other concessions that Israel made . These depend on a mutuality of interest and what I 'll mention John and my closing points is the very specific concrete benefits that relationship with Israel provides to the United States . They are very concrete from intelligent sharing , to missile technology sharing to standing shoulder-to-shoulder to oppose Iranian nuclear threats . So the interests are not just values , they are profound U.S. national security interest , but again , the direct answer to your question is , it would send a signal to Israel of inconsistency as it would be less likely make concessions - but they would say the same to all other allies , but what it would say - John Donvan : But would it be harmful for Israel is one of the questions - Stuart Eizenstat : It would very harmful for Israel because Israel would be completely alone . </s>
Where else does it have a very close relationship ? </s>
To whom else would it turn for support ? I mean in the 1967 war , at the maximum time of their danger , all right when the state was almost eliminated by all the Arab countries , their prime arms supplier was not the United States of America , it was France . </s>
And in the midst of the war , that arms shipments were totally cut off , a 100 % cut off . So Israel has nowhere else to turn as a major ally other than the United States , it would feel increasingly isolated . It would be much more intractable in terms of the peace process , and I think it would be a terrible thing both for Israel and for the United States . John Donvan : To the other side , is it an act of betrayal to put distance- Roger Cohen : No , it 's not an act of betrayal . </s>
With respects to nobody is arguing for a divorce here . </s>
Nobody is arguing that Israel should cease being an ally of the United States . So , we are simply arguing that when President Obama says that he wants settlements to stop and settlements continue and Prime Minister Netanyahu declares that some settlements are Israel 's for all eternity , that there should be consequences , and I believe that if the United States were firmer if it made clear to Israel that there are indeed consequences , then Israel would measure its actions much more carefully and there would be more chance of getting a resumption of Israeli-Palestinian talks , which are currently paralyzed . Israel , if it thinks it can act with complete impunity is not going to be responsive to U.S. desires . John Donvan : Let me go to Itamar , he is looking at- Itamar Rabinovich : Briefly I like to say of course , it would not be good for Israel if the U.S. walked away from the special relationship . There would be both substantive and a perception issue of weakening Israel . </s>
Israel would go to the right , maybe to the radical right . My point what is going to happen to the United States . Now , let me read sentence from the most unlikely source . If you go this week 's New Yorker , Seymour Hersh discussion with Bashar Assad , the President of Syria , says , now the problem is that the United States is weaker and whole - in financial world , is weak as world . You always need power to do politics and nobody is doing politics . </s>
What you need is a strong United States with good politics not weaker United States . </s>
For United States it walks away from Israel it sends the signal of weakness inconsistent , it 's not going to be good for U.S. policy . John Donvan : Rashid Khalidi Rashid Khalidi : I think this is like telling us when you are deep hole , the thing to do is dig deeper . I mean we have enabled , we have enabled , the worst instincts of Israel politics . We have enabled and supported and financed the worst policies in terms of , leave aside American interest . We are all Americans that should be the only thing that matters to us . </s>
Israeli interest , why is occupation and settlement in the Israeli interest ? Ambassador Rabinovich is opposed , is an opponent of these things . </s>
Most right thinking Israelis that most of know are but Israeli politics is moving exactly the opposite direction . What we are doing is enabling these tendencies . Let me say one other thing about constancy . </s>
When we are doing something that everybody in the world think is dominant . The idea of staying the course does not make us look constant , it makes us look dumb . </s>
And our allies we were asked rhetorically by one of my opponents , if United States moved away from the special relationship what will happen with some of our allies , they would applaud . They see the United States as systematically weakening itself by this perverse special relationship . </s>
John Donvan : Stuart Eizenstat , what about that very point that our allies would actually applaud readjustment to number of relationships ? Stuart Eizenstat : Two things . First of all when Roger says he is not calling for a divorce , okay . Sometimes it difficult for spouses and countries to tell the difference between a separation and a divorce . The implications can be the same . </s>
And second , I was ambassador to the European Union . I have spent an enormous amount of time in Europe . I can tell you that it would send a chill down the spine of every ally we have in Europe and around the world if this relationship were abandoned . </s>
Because they would say , we will next on chopping block . </s>
It would a terrible side of inconstancy what the world wants is a strong constant United States that stands behind its principles , that stands behind its value and stands behinds its allies . Roger Cohen : If I may- John Donvan : Roger Cohen . Roger Cohen : With respect I also spend a lot time in the European Union not as an ambassador . </s>
And my perception of European publics and European governments is that many are bewildered by the extent and degree of U.S. support for Israel and would applaud some modification of that relationship . John Donvan : The side arguing for the motion I said that made a rather cogent argument , quite logical that U.S. relationship with Israel raises the question whether the United States can be an honest broker in the Middle East . </s>
What - take that on either side-against the motions . Stuart Eizenstat : We both seen it from different perspective myself and United States perspective and get is really perspective . Every moderate care country knows that only the United States can talk to both sides . It is the only honest broker . And indeed if it were to withdraw from that special relationship it would lose the capacity to have then ear of the Israelis in a way it does now . </s>
It is an honest broker that 's why even though there is a quartet with the UN and Russia and so forth and the EU . It 's only the United States , the Secretaries of State , the President who were the active ingredients in the Peace process . The Arab states know that , Europeans know that , Israelis know that , and so we are accepted as the honest broker . And again , I think that Itamar is right , you are retreading Bush , we have got a different President who has reached out to the Muslim world and who said entire world , yes , we want to have stronger relationships with the Muslim world . Yes , we want to have a two states solution but yes we stand firmly behind the state of Israel as a Jewish State , that 's being an honest broker and that 's what accepted on all sides . </s>
John Donvan : Does the other side agree that President Obama is changing the game ? Rashid Khalidi : I 'd actually like to say something about this honest broker thing . I do n't think United States in any way an honest broker . </s>
United States is quite frequently the only broker because United States hugs the stage . Look at what the United States does to the quartet , it essentially tries to turn them into bunch of oodles who will follow the American lead , it successfully does that quite frequently even with European Union and with the Russians . And I think this is actually a problem . </s>
We have seen more constructive diplomacy in the Middle East from Qatar and Turkey ; incidentally an important Democratic ally . A country with a public sphere . A major ally over decades going back to launching of NATO . </s>
The only democracy in the Middle East is not Israel . And we have seen more constructive diplomacy from those two countries than we have seen from the United States over the past several years as far as brokering a peace between or trying to broker a peace . For example , arranging a settlement of the conflict in Lebanon , and I would suggest that it is in the United States ' interest to bring others in . It 's in the United States interest to make this a multilateral settlement . James Baker , to his enormous credit , understood this . </s>
And that 's one of the most important achievements of Madrid . It was to bring other parties in , that United States has this tendency to monopolize things . It is a tendency to be resistant . </s>
John Donvan : Do you see President Obama changing the game ? Roger Cohen : I think the president 's problem at the moment is that he 's gone a long way in words with the Cairo speech , with the speech in Istanbul , with other gestures . But when it comes to actions , and people are looking at actions , I think the Palestinians tend to see more of the same . And that is the issue here . </s>
Can we be imaginative ? Can we think outside of the box ? Look , when the Oslo Accord came in the 1990s , the PLO Charter still existed . It existed until 1996 in its original form calling for the annihilation of Israel . Now did this stop the imaginative negotiators in the 1990s from moving that process forward . </s>
Oslo was 1993 ; this was done while the charter still existed . </s>
The Hamas charter calling for annihilation of Israel is vile . It is unacceptable . But can we think outside the box about these things ? Can we look for new forms of engagement ? </s>
Can we think and act in different ways that might advance peace ? </s>
I think , so far , the verdict on the Obama administration and on what Mr. Mitchell has been trying to achieve is no . And I it is important that we look at the Middle East the way it is , not the way we would like it to be or imagine it might be , but what the reality of this increasingly sophisticated Middle East is today what is Hamas really ? </s>
What is bothered really ? Let 's look at these things in a hard headed way and let 's think about and find some new ideas . </s>
And I think right now the president in a half way house and that 's why we seeing no movement . John Donvan : I want to let Itamar Rabinovich answer that question but I - after that I get to questions from the audience , so I’d like to disperse our microphones and bring the light up . Itamar your response ? </s>
Itamar Rabinovich : You know President Obama 's -- some distancing from Israel . Abu Mazen , President of the Palestinian authority is not joining the negotiations now . Because he says President Obama , you put me up on a tree , you have to help me climb down . Because President Obama seemed to be taking a pro-Palestinian anti-Israel position at the outset . </s>
His expectation was that the Muslim and Arab world will applaud . The real reaction was give us more . </s>
We will not come to the negotiations , you have to deliver Israel . It was a very bad mistake . And Roger when you say , think out of the box about the Hamas charter , which is not an anti-Israeli , an anti- Semitic document , speaking about the protocols of Zion , I do n't know how to think outside the box about that , I would rather be in the box . John Donvan : Roger Cohen Roger Cohen : So was charter of the PLO . It got changed and how did it get changed ? </s>
It got changed through negotiations . </s>
John Donvan : Can you respond to that Itamar ? Itamar Rabinovich : Yes . </s>
You can negotiate with a secular nationalist movement like the Fatah . Hamas is a radical religious fundamentalist organization and you can not negotiate with people who have these strong religious convictions . John Donvan : Itamar- Rashid Khalidi : Israel is negotiating with them . Israel is negotiating with prisoner release with Hamas right now . </s>
Israel negotiates with Hamas all the time . In fact it suits Israel perfectly , perfectly to have Hamas and Fatah divided and to have nobody to talk to . You will have peace in this part of the world between Palestinians and Israelis when there is not just a Israeli consensus but a Palestinian consensus . There are enough people in Hamas who are interested in a resolution of this conflict that if , as Roger said if you think outside the box , we could get something . </s>
Itamar Rabinovich : So , when Ehud Olmert went out of his way and offered much more than Ehud Barak and any other Israeli politician , put it on the table , why did Abu Mazen not take it ? John Donvan : Let me go to questions from the audience . </s>
We are going to leave a lot of things hanging because we will keep going . We will come back . You can put that question to him , I want to move on to this . And if one of you wants to take that question back you are welcome to us , write down and see the gentlemen . </s>
Unidentified Participant : Thank you . John Donvan : Please stand up and if you 're with the media , let 's known . Zead Ramadan : My name is Zead Ramadan , I am the President of the Council on American Islamic Relations in New York . </s>
It was often said of Yasser Arafat that he never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity . Is it - have we come into the era where Israel is starting to make decisions in its worst interest that Charles Freeman , who was a nominee for one of the top intelligence posts in the United States criticized them and said that himself before he pulled his nomination due to criticism from Israel and American elected officials . </s>
Are we entering an era where Israel continuously make decisions and hurts its future ? John Donvan : How would you relate that also to U.S. interest which is our topic tonight ? Zead Ramadan : Absolutely . </s>
We - as an American , I think back as a Palestinian myself , I am jaded whenever they say , whether it 's Jimmy Carter or Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan or George Bush senior or junior , it 's always said that we are going to work towards peace in the Middle East , and it always seems like an Israeli Prime Minister is pitching the phrase with the U.S. President and says , 'it does n't matter what you say . We 're going to do whatever we want to do and we still going to take your billions from you all the time ' . So as my tax dollars are going to build settlements where – John Donvan : Yeah , I do need a question , what 's your question ? Zead Ramadan : I apologize . </s>
John Donvan : No , I want a question , that 's on a topic . Ziad Ramadan : Is it in the U.S. interest to support Israel financially while they continuously disagree with – John Donvan : Stuart Eizenstat to decide . </s>
Stuart Eizenstat : A couple of things , first , several people have mentioned including Roger inaccurately that the United States continues to provide huge amounts of economic aid to Israel . I can tell you that during the first Olmert government , they came to me when I was Undersecretary of State and they said we are now a highly developed country . </s>
We do n't need , and we do n't want that economic assistance and they came to us and I negotiated the total cut off of that aid . There is not a nickel in economic aid being given to Israel . The aid now is all economics . John Donvan : Roger Cohen . </s>
Stuart Eizenstat : And the aid is all given for security purposes and not economic purposes , it 's all security . Roger Cohen : Congressional report just put the total at $ 28.9 billion over the past decades so how you can state there is no economic aid going from United States to Israel . I do n't know . In response to your questions I - critics of Israel are often told that they are anti Israeli . My response is no , I think in have the long-term interest of Israel in my heart and to say that it is Israel’s interest to go on building these settlements strikes me as the height of foolishness because what will be the result of this ? </s>
We are at the point or we are very close to the point where a two state solution becomes impossible . At that point , we are talking about a single state between the river and the sea . That state will very soon - such a state will very soon have more Palestinian Arabs in it than Jews . What then is going to happen to the Zionist dream ? </s>
And I think to point this out to Israel , is in fact acting in Israel 's self interest , and the unfortunate thing about U.S. policy is it does n't - without stepping back it does n't act strongly enough to stop Israel making a two-states solution impossible . </s>
And I think that is the very core of the issue here . </s>
John Donvan : Gentlemen with eye glasses , sorry ? Unidentified Participant : Question for Mr. Cohen and Khalidi . John Donvan : Could you bring the mike a little bit closer ? Unidentified Participant : When Stuart Eizenstat said earlier on in the debate that had the Palestinians had a Palestinian version of Gandhi or King it would have been a two states solution a long time ago . Is that a statement with which you agree or disagree , and if you disagree , why ? </s>
And separately , what is the answer to the question that we lost as we transitioned into the Q & A , why did Abu Mazen turn down the deal ? John Donvan : Thank you . Rashid Khalidi : Why do n't I answer that question first ? Abu Mazen does much of what he does because he is weak . </s>
He is weak because we have made him weak . He is weak for other reasons as well . But a primary reason is because Israel and the United States have systematically undermined him . What happened with the Goldstone report ? </s>
I do n't want to go into the Goldstone report . Abu Mazen was pressured , was blackmailed , was threatened by the Israelis to , in effect prevent the consideration by United Nations Human Rights body of a report that was critical both of Hamas and especially of Israel . This is an example of the kind of situation that Abu Mazen is in . Why is he in this situation ? </s>
He is in the situation because he does not represent all the Palestinians , and he is in that situation because the Palestinian coalition government which would have included have Hamas was something that was strongly opposed both by Israel and the United States . And that would have been a government in which Hamas would have authorized Abu Mazen to ahead and negotiate with Israel . That would have been a government that might conceivably have reached an agreement or might not have . </s>
But it certainly would have better than the situation we are in . And let just create one point about the special relationship . One of the things that the special relationship does is it imports Israeli considerations into U.S. law . I was told by an American official one of the reasons we ca n't have a Palestinian coalition government which might in fact be a better negotiating partner is because it 's against U.S. law . </s>
We would have to cut-off our funding to any government that included Hamas even a government that authorized negotiations for peace . </s>
That is an example of why we should end this special relationship . </s>
John Donvan : Stuart Eizenstat . Stuart Eizenstat : I want to answer the question and connect an important thread and say something I have n't said publicly before because there is a connection . I sat with Yasser Arafat in his office in Romala three weeks before Camp David who was suppose to start with President Clinton and Prime Minister Barak . </s>
He said to me , tell President Clinton not to invite me , I 'm not ready to go and to negotiate . Likewise the reason why Arafat would n't go or did n't want to go and why he turned down a remarkable concession from Barak , 95 % of the territory , East Jerusalem is the capital is the same reason that Abu Mazen would n't accept and even more generous offer from all Olmert and that is they are afraid they will be assassinated by Hamas . That 's point blank the reason . </s>
And the radicals in the Palestinian movement who I do not believer in a majority have a tremendous hammer-hold over the moderate . </s>
John Donvan : Let 's go to another question . Gentleman , yes , yellow tie . You can stand and - I owe you a comeback . </s>
Unidentified Participant : My question is very specifically about U.S. interest and U.S. security – John Donvan : Can you bring your microphone up a little bit ? Unidentified Participant : Sorry . Very specifically about U.S. interest and U.S. security , you talked a lot about the Palestinian-Israeli conflict and how the special relationships affect , the special relationship affect the peace process , but very specifically how would change in this relationship affect U.S. security interest specifically vis-à-vis the jihadi elements who are working against the U.S.. How would that relationship either improve their view of the U.S. or be a detriment to the U.S. ? John Donvan : I was just talking about the impact on our allies , you are asking about the impact on our relationship with our foes , which side would like to take that . Roger Cohen : Well , I think if you can advance a Middle East peace clearly you are going to withdraw , remove , a very powerful recruitment tool - for the jihadis . </s>
If you look at Osama Bin Laden 's speeches going back a very long way . If you look in the 9/11 report it what Khalid Sheikh Mohammad said , the mastermind of 9/11 about how policy toward the Palestinians was really what drove him toward the - It was n't his stay in the United States . It was what he observed of U.S. Israeli policy toward the Palestinians . So , if you can appear more as an honest broker , if you can move this paralyzed process in some way , then I think you could advance U.S. security in that respect . Look have the Palestinians made mistakes , have there been office on the table that should perhaps have been accepted , yes . </s>
But we 're not talking about the past . We 're talking about trying to move forward here , that is what this debate is about tonight , and I think to throw out the Olmert offer when he was already had great legal difficulties , was on his way out of office , it really was n't credible at that point . So I do n't find that in any way persuasive . John Donvan : Itamar Rabinovich Itamar Rabinovich : Two issues , one , terrorism , that support for Israel increases terrorism , and you all know New Yorkers , you live in New York , open the magazine last week , very interesting story about a young man from Alabama , Omar Hammami , who grew up in a small town in Alabama , and he is now fighting with Al Qaeda in Somalia . </s>
Very interesting long article in the New York Times magazine . </s>
The word Israel does n't appear once . He became a terrorist not because of Israel but because of other reasons . Secondly , I want to go back to the point raised by Stuart Eizenstat before . Gandhi , other leaders . </s>
Abu Mazen is not weak because the United States or Israel weakened him . He is weak because he is weak . Where you have - even people who made peace , Gandhi was not made by the British , Mandela was not made by the Americans and King Hussein and Anwar El Sadat who signed peace with Israel were strong leaders . That 's why they could take their countries to peace . </s>
But unfortunately , we have not had the kind of Palestinian leader who would become , who could become the Palestinian Mandela , who would bring about the rapprochement , the reconciliation between Israelis and Palestinians . This comes from an Israeli who wants that . Rashid Khalidi : Let me say something . Let me say something . Let me say something about this sainted Nelson Mandela , a man who I think , we all greatly respect . </s>
He headed an armed movement . </s>
He was not an apostle of non-violence . </s>
He led an armed movement that succeeded in forcing a political resolution of a conflict . Now , I personally am a believer in this conflict , now , that non-violent means are the best means for the Palestinians . I do n't think , however , that we should get too mystical about this . There are many colonial , many oppressive , many occupation regimes that would never ever disappeared but for armed violent resistance . That is something that - that is something that 's very painful to say because in this country , we have a constitution , and what Martin Luther King was calling for was that we live up to the highest principles of this country . </s>
I argue that in the Palestinian case , that would be appropriate , although for other reasons . But to say in a situation of occupation , and in a situation of oppression , this is not two equal parties . </s>
These are not two states . There is one country between the Mediterranean and the sea . It occupies the entirety of the territory . </s>
It 's the only sovereign state . It has ruled every single Palestinian in that territory , some of them as citizens of the State of Israel , a minority , four million of them as helots with no rights for 43 years , resistance in that case is legitimate . John Donvan : Go back to the audience . </s>
Unidentified Participant : Good evening . Is it anti-semitism of United Nations which Israel and America always complains about that their 50 and odd resolutions requesting Israel to vacate the occupied land , Israel and America look the other way , but whereas when it comes to Iraq war , Bush Presidency on one resolution went for an illegal war . This special arrangement between Israel and America is really hurting , in my opinion , and my question to one of the panelists will be , why are these resolutions not implemented , which are asking Israel to vacate the occupied land ? </s>
John Donvan : You 're asking if U.S. has a double standard on UN resolution ? Unidentified Participant : U.S. has a double standard , Israel has a double standard . </s>
John Donvan : Thank you . Roger Cohen : The United States has vetoed . </s>
John Donvan : Roger , I want to bring this to the insider first and then I 'll come to you , okay ? </s>
Stuart Eizenstat . </s>
Stuart Eizenstat : The UN Human Rights Commission has developed resolutions over the last decade and a half , two-thirds of which are directed at Israel , not in Iran , not in Iraq , not at all the human rights violations that occur around the world . Two-thirds are directed to Israel . This is grossly disproportionate . Number two , with respect to general resolutions , let 's go back to the first resolution of the United Nations , which was to create a two state solution . And Ben Gurion accepted a sliver of territory and it was rejected by the Arabs and that rejection has continued with the exception of Egypt and Jordan from 1947 to 2010 . </s>
John Donvan : Roger Cohen ? Roger Cohen : United States has vetoed more than 40 resolutions critical of Israel of recent years . That 's more I believe than all the vetoes put together of all the other members of the Security Council . This is indeed a special relationship . And the question we 're asking tonight is , is that really in the benefit of the United States and Israel ? </s>
And I would submit not . If you look at the Goldstone report , the UN report on the war in Gaza , surely this report was imperfect . No doubt there were errors in it . </s>
I know Judge Goldstone . I met him years ago and the Hague , believe me , he is balanced and intelligent man . Did he make some mistakes , yes , but the Israeli reaction was , no this is just an expression of the world 's bias , this is an outrage . This is absolutely unacceptable . </s>
And the U.S. gave it some protection in that stance , which I consider to have been outrageous . There is no justification for the position what is happened since . Israel has quietly censured two generals . It has agreed to pay compensation to the United Nations . Behind the defiance , it has been making its own admissions of the fact that they were problems in this , and I think it is the United States ' special relationship with Israel which allows it to say before the world , no , we never make mistakes , this is all a plot against us , and I do n't think this is helpful to Israel . </s>
And it is not good for the United States to be in that position . John Donvan : Itamar Rabinovich ? Itamar Rabinovich : The United Nations , the Human Rights Commission , do you know who are the members of that commission ? Who was the Chairman of that commission , the country called Libya . Who is a member of that commission ? </s>
Zimbabwe with Mugabe . Roger , you are from originally , you know South Africa and you know who Mugabe is . So if the commission has Libya and Zimbabwe and countries like that , it has no moral authority and Goldstone drew his mandate from a place without moral authority . </s>
John Donvan : Rashid Khalidi . Rashid Khalidi : Yes . </s>
As someone whose father works for the United Nations , I am going to defend this institution . </s>
I think it ill - it does not behoove those who are friends of Israel to bash United Nations . </s>
The certificate of Israel is delivered by the United Nations in the form of the resolution that Ambassador Eizenstat mentioned , the partition resolution of 1947 . Now that did not give the issue a sliver of Palestine . It gave 33 % of the population that owned 6 % of the land , 55 % of the country ; some sliver . Let me say a couple of other things . I can not let some of these things pass simply as a historian . </s>
We are told that the Arab countries have been rejecting everything since 2010 . </s>
The majority of Arab countries came to the Madrid Peace Conference . Ambassador Rabinovich and I saw them there . Now what kind of rejection is it when they come to a peace conference . They all voted in favor of an Arab peace resolution in Beirut and one before that , way back in 2002 . </s>
This is not rejection . </s>
We were told about remarkable concessions . Remember , when a country is in illegal occupation of territory and it agrees to give it back , there are various ways of talking about that . I would not use the word concession . Thirdly – John Donvan : Rashid , I just want to ask you , how long is your list ? Rashid Khalidi : Pardon me ? </s>
John Donvan : How long is your list ? Rashid Khalidi : I have two more , but I will go for one . John Donvan : Thank you . Rashid Khalidi : Okay . </s>
We were told that in 1967 , Israel was almost eliminated . If you go to the U.S. government documents and you go to the extraordinarily ample Israeli documentation , you will see that not one Israeli military intelligence or American military intelligence report or military officer of field rank and above thought that there was any chance of Israel being defeated let alone eliminated in the 1967 war . I know people here believe that was a possibility , I know that many people in Israel feared it , but that was not a possibility at that time . I could go on and on . John Donvan : Okay , all right , I want to go back to a question here . </s>
I need to do a little bit of announcing for radio . I just want to remind everybody , we are in a question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan of ABC News acting as moderator . We have four debaters . Two teams of two debating this motion , the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel . </s>
The gentlemen standing now with grey suit , red tie ? John Girkoff : Thank you . </s>
My Name is John Girkoff . Among other things , I am affiliated with Tel Aviv University . A question I have is - small statement , but then a question is all the attention tonight has been against Israel or for Israel or against the United States or for the United States , but the Palestinians have to start taking some responsibility for what 's going on ? And the question I have is , what have they done over the last 40 years to instill the confidence in the United States , to maybe ease up on the relationship or become more , as you say , evenhanded and what can - do you think they should be doing or can be doing to instill the confidence that you two have that the United States should end that relationship ? John Donvan : Thank you for the question . </s>
Good question . Rashid Khalidi : It 's a very good question . </s>
As someone who wrote a book recently about just this issue in Palestinian history about the responsibility of the Palestinians have to consider for things that have happened in Palestinian history not just in the last couple of decades , but going back to the 20s and 30s , I think it 's a question that should be asked by Palestinians and to Palestinians , and I take the point . What can Palestinians do ? Firstly , they have to get their act together . </s>
It 's absolutely essentially that there be a Palestinian consensus on how to get out of the mess that they are in , and that 's up to the Palestinians themselves . Nobody else can do that for them and that 's the first thing . We are taking about Israel because that 's the proposition before the house . You voted on something about the United States and Israeli special relationship , but I think it 's a good question anyway because this is a key element of this problem . </s>
The Palestinians , I have to say , have not just been systematic divided by outside forces . They have failed to unify themselves . The Palestinians have not just failed to generate some of the leadership that I think they deserve . I have been very critical of Palestinian leadership in the past . </s>
It is however the case that their leadership has been systematically subject to assassination , not just by Israel , also by Arab governments , and they have problems not only with Israel , they have severe problems with all of the Arab governments with which they have to deal . Governments which by and large are not democratic , governments which by and large do not represent their own people , and that 's another problem that we 're not discussing here , but which I think is well worth discussing . John Donvan : I just want to ask , are there no women with questions ? Thank you . </s>
I did n't see you before . Right in the center , we 're going to do three women in a row here now . Right in the center , do you have a microphone ? Okay , I 'll come back , I will come to you . </s>
Rema Azazi : Thank you . John Donvan : Can you bring the mike a little bit closer ? Rema Azazi : Thank you , can you hear me ? John Donvan : It 's not on yet , try one more time . </s>
It 's not your fault . </s>
Rema Azazi : Hi , can you hear me ? John Donvan : Yes . </s>
Rema Azazi : Okay . My name is Rema Azazi ( ph ) , I 'm Masters in Near-Eastern Studies at NYU . </s>
The idea of morality has been mentioned by both sides . </s>
It 's been mostly invoked by Mr. Eizenstat saying that we ca n't end this special relationship because it would be undermining the morality , that is what the special relationship is . And I would like to ask you , Mr. Eizenstat , why the principle of morality is not being applied to the case of the Palestinians ? So , when you discuss that justice and fairness is important , what would justice and fairness look like in the West Bank and Gaza ? What can Israel do for justice and fairness to exist there ? </s>
And can you also speak about justice and fairness for Palestinians who live in Israel and have Israeli citizenship ? I 'm specifically thinking of the – John Donvan : Are you asking what Israel can do or what the U.S. can do , because I would like to stay more towards – Rema Azazi : U.S. and Israel ? John Donvan : Okay , thank you . Fair enough . </s>
Stuart Eizenstat . Stuart Eizenstat : I think it 's very good question and it is a moral imperative of the United States , not only to support Israel 's independence and security , but also to see to it that the Palestinians have a decent standard of living and a state of their own . It is the United States of America that is the major economic supplier of aid to the Palestinians , okay ? Not France , not Germany , not the UK , not Russia , it is the United States . Number two , right now as we speak , General Dayton , a three-star-general is in the process of training over 20,000 Palestinian police who are in places like Jenin now able to take over security and allowing the Israeli defense forces to withdraw allowing checkpoints to be reduced . </s>
I met in Davos ten days ago , Prime Minister Fayyad , he is a great man . He is a great man , he building a state from the bottom up . He told me , Stu , we are going to have 10 % real growth in the territories in the West Bank , and the reason is because the Palestinians are now under U.S. leadership , beginning to take on their own security , rooting out Hamas and giving the Israeli defense forces the confidence to withdraw . </s>
So the United States is supporting economically , militarily , in every other way the effort of the Palestinians to develop their state . And George Mitchell , who negotiated after many , many hard years , the Good Friday agreement on Northern Ireland is a superb negotiator . He is there every month negotiating as an honest broker with a notion that we have a responsibility to the Palestinians as well as to the Israelis . John Donvan : I want to come back to you because I saw how intently you were listening to . </s>
What did you think of that answer ? Rema Azazi : ( inaudible ) . John Donvan : Yes , we will bring a mike , let 's just get a mike come back to you , but I do n't want to go on terribly long . I just want to know if it went to the point that you were asking about ? </s>
Rema Azazi : I would like to , is it on , compare the aid that you just spoke up with the millions or billions of dollars that go towards Israel in terms of military aid , if not other aid as well . John Donvan : Okay . Stuart Eizenstat : The aid to the Palestinians only started fairly recently because it is only after Madrid that the PLO abandoned their charter to destroy Israel , Hamas is yet to do it and indicated a willingness to have a two state solution although they we have n't fulfilled it . </s>
So the economic aid has n't accumulated but it is very substantial . On a per capita basis , very substantial , and it 's all going for economic assistance . </s>
John Donvan : There was a , yes . Ma’am , I see you in the far corner and you have a yellow pad in your hand , and if you wave it , a microphone will come to you . Sarah Lehman : My name is Sarah Lehman ( ph ) and I write for the Jewish press , and I have a statement and a question directed mostly towards Roger Cohen . John Donvan : Can you do more question than statement ? </s>
Sarah Lehman : Yes , okay . In light of the fact that Israeli concessions over the years have not led to peace because the Palestinians have responded mostly with violence and also in light of the fact that Hamas charter has not changed its call for the destruction of the Jewish state , and the incitement that continues to go on - anti-Semitic incitement and propaganda by the Palestinians under the supposed moderate – John Donvan : I need to come home with this question , I see where you are going . Sarah Lehman : Personally as a Jew , how would you - why would advocate a severing of the special relationship with America in favor of towards Arabs or Palestinians who wish for your demise ? </s>
John Donvan : That 's a question for Roger Cohen ? Sarah Lehman : Anyone . Roger Cohen : I think I have tried to describe why - certainly , there have been Israeli attempts , very serious Israeli attempts to make peace . But if you look at the last 20 years , peace is going to involve an exchange of land , and what has Israel continued to do over the last 20 years ? It has doubled , tripled the size of the settlements in the West Bank and this simply makes it impossible to make that exchange . Look , what we just heard about what 's happening in the West Bank shows that there is nothing congenital about a Palestinian inability to take responsibility for their lives and for their governance . </s>
Given half the chance , I think they are capable of it . But when , if you , have you driven through the West Bank recently , madam ? Sarah Lehman : Yes . Roger Cohen : What did you see ? I think you saw a fractured , divided Palestinian community . </s>
Israeli garrisons on every hill , road blocks , the difficulty of families to get to the market , to get the fields , to get to their jobs and so on . What does this say to Palestinians about the seriousness of Israeli intent to make peace ? </s>
It says these guys are not serious , and why has it that the Prime Minister Fayyad has not come back to the table . He has not come back to the table because the Palestinians are not satisfied of the essential seriousness of Israel . And what is enabling the government or Prime Minister Netanyahu to take this stance , it is the unconditional nature of U.S. support under the special relationship , which is why ladies and gentlemen you should vote for the proposition tonight . John Donvan : We are coming down towards the end of the question section , so I just want to ask the panelist at this point to be slightly more concise . We are doing a few more questions . </s>
Itamar Rabinovich . Itamar Rabinovich : Commenting on Roger Cohen 's last comment , I think in an earlier comment , you actually provided the answers to why the Palestinians will not negotiate . Because you painted a scenario that over the next 10 , 20 years , if the status quo continues , there will be one country with a Palestinian majority . This stretch has not been lost on many Palestinians , and support for the two state solution has dwindled among the Palestinians because many of them say , let’s sit back and wait and it will be all ours . </s>
Because it will be one man , one vote with a Palestinian majority , and that is a very serious danger . That 's why there are also commonalties - even commonalities between Rashid Khalidi and I because - Roger Cohen : It 's a matter of danger exist , why is Israel not being more serious about a two state solution , which is the only way to avoid a one state outcome . </s>
Itamar Rabinovich : Because the answer is - because the party I voted for lost the last election . </s>
Roger Cohen : Well , there you go . Thank you . John Donvan : Rashid . Rashid Khalidi : Palestinians negotiate . I 'm a Palestinian American . </s>
I spent three years negotiating , you were dealing with the Syrians , I was dealing with - Itamar Rabinovich : With Israelis . Rashid Khalidi , : Yes . With Yaken Rubenstein ( ph ) specifically . </s>
And what we were facing then was an American commitment under the first Bush administration to do something if things were done , that prejudged or in some way prefigured an outcome and we came to them . And we said , wait a minute , Israelis are closing off Jerusalem , the close of Jerusalem was just starting in this period and settlement is continuing . They are eating the pie we are supposed to be negotiating and we got no response from the United States . This was in 1991 , went for years and years and years , Palestinians were negotiating . Palestinians negotiated with Israel without any problem for that entire decade and got absolutely nowhere . </s>
Now you can say the Oslo Accords , the Oslo Accords immiserated the Palestinians . Palestinian GDP decreased over that decade from 1990 to 2000 . The Palestinians who were able to move anywhere in the occupied territories into Israel to the Golan Heights in 1990 or '91 , '92 were locked into whatever you want to call them , Bantustans , ghettos whatever you want to call them by the end of that period of the Oslo Accord . So this process of settlement is not something which is just a minor issue . It is a central issue , it is absolutely central if you expect the Palestinian negotiate , this is something that should have been stopped 20 years ago , not 2010 . </s>
Stuart Eizenstat : Professor , you are historian . I was in charge of the economic dimension of the peace process . I can tell you your figures are totally incorrect . Between 1997 and 2000 , the territories grew at an average of 5 % , unemployment was down to 8 % in the West Bank and 14 % in Gaza . A 100,000 Palestinians were coming into Israel every single day to work . </s>
It was 40 % of the GDP of the territories remittances . 20,000 Arab Palestinian business people could drive in without any checkpoints . Yes , 1997 and then what happened ? </s>
Yasser Arafat in 2000 brought the whole house of cards down on the process , refusing the offer and instigating the second intifada . So it 's very important to understand case and effect here . We were on a real process of peace , I personally went to Gaza . </s>
I saw the Gaza industrial estate with 30 companies from all over the world creating 1200 jobs in Gaza , a second phase started . We had Israelis visiting Romolo ( ph ) over the weekend . We had 100,000 Palestinians coming into Israel every day to work . </s>
John Donvan : Stuart , we see where you are going , but I just have a little bit more time left , woman on the balcony and just give a minute for the camera to find you . Danielle Abraham : My name is Danielle Abraham ( ph ) , I am at Argos - student at the Argos program of leadership and diplomacy that Herzliya in Israel . We just arrived two days ago . My question is about U.S. public opinion . Because as we saw on the last Presidential debate as in all presidential debates , the one thing that both can take always ( inaudible ) is the special relationship with Israel and this is not the coincidence . </s>
This is because the all studies and all polls show that the United States public supports this special relationship . Now , - John Donvan : So what 's your question ? </s>
Danielle Abraham : So my question is of course to Mr. Cohen and professor Khalidi should - is n't it a shame that this the public support of the people , is n't it a shame to American democracy that this is not factored in to this debate ? John Donvan : Well , Roger Cohen ? Roger Cohen : Thank you for that question . It makes any adjustment in U.S. policy toward Israel such as President Obama is now trying to accomplish extremely difficult . </s>
There is a state called Florida . It 's a vital state in the U.S. presidential election . It has a large Jewish community . This calculation is not lost on America’s leadership . President Obama , I understand , has been told by some Jewish congressman , if you want your health bill , step back on Israel . </s>
So the reality is indeed that it is very hard – I have heard that reliably . The reality of the situation is that it is extremely difficult to steer a U.S. public opinion in any way toward any acceptance of an adjustment of policy towards the State of Israel . I think it should be done in the following terms : The President should explain that the adjustments he is making are in pursuit of peace and in pursuit of the long-term peace and security of the State of Israel . Policies up to now have failed . Therefore , we should see a change . </s>
John Donvan : Stuart Eizenstat ? Stuart Eizenstat : I was wondering how long it would take and who would raise the issue of quote unquote , `` Untoward Jewish influence over U.S. formed policies . '' I am glad you finally ( inaudible ) came to it . Roger Cohen : I didn’t say untoward . </s>
Stuart Eizenstat : Now let me just say I have served in three administrations . I did n't say all - this is a dangerous canard that 2 % of the U.S. population has somehow got its hand around the neck of American foreign policy . American foreign policy towards Israel is supported by a bipartisan majority because the American public recognizes that Israel and the United States share common interest and common values . And those are always counter balanced by oil interest , by corporate interest that have major defense interest , major business interest , that 's the way policies is made in the United States , is just a clash of interest . But the notion that 2 % of the U.S. population is driving a policy against where the public thinks simply belied by every survey that 's been made . </s>
Roger Cohen : Nobody said that . John Donvan : Itamar Rabinovich Itamar Rabinovich : Maybe you should elect a President from Alaska where there are no Jews . Rashid Khalidi : You would like that . John Donvan : There is a gentleman with the blazer and sweater . This may be our last question . </s>
Unidentified Participant : My name is Allen Skolnick ( ph ) . </s>
Israel as many of you know has 1.2 million Arabs living in Israel they are probably more mosque in Israel than or certainly than they are maybe close to synagogues in Europe . With that background in mind the presumption that we hear all during the discussion of course this debate is that Palestinian state if it was to be would have to be essentially without any Jews . </s>
The whole discussion is the settlements is the biggest impediment to peace , alter something out of the box , Roger Cohen , what is the Palestinian position which I think might in gender more , a better U.S. special relationship ? Why is n't built on a basis of inclusion even at the scant change of minority of Jews and establish itself on enforcing minority rights for some even for Jews and demonstrate its small character and its commitment to peace instead of having to give a constant reiteration of a new Arab country that will be one more without any Jews . </s>
John Donvan : Roger Cohen . Roger Cohen : Thank you sir . </s>
I 'm not sure there are many Israelis who would want to go and live in the West Bank . Certainly , under the current conditions there are some who live there , I am not going to argue with this , that Israel is by far the most liberal and democratic state in the region . It has a free press , it has a relatively independent judiciary , it has democratic system , it has remarkable achievements in technology and its economy . It has everything except peace , and what we are talking about tonight is how the best to stay here this remarkable society toward whether it 's requesting for and I do n't think it 's through the policy that Israel is currently pursuing or through the current banking that United States is giving for those polices that is what we are debating . Would a Palestinian state is ever comes into being should it offer ecology of opportunity for citizens of all race , religion , background , et cetera , yes , it should . </s>
John Donvan : And that concludes around two of our debates . And here is where we are about to hear brief closing statements from each of the debaters in turn . </s>
Those statements will be two minutes each and it 's their last chance to change your mind and from the live audience beforehand we knew where you stood before the debate actually begin on our motion the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel . We asked you to vote before the debate where you stood and at that point 33 % of you were for the motion and 42 % were against and 25 % remained undecided , you will be asked to vote once again and pick the winner in just a few minutes from now . But first we are going onto round three closing statements and speaking first against the motion . The U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel . </s>
Stuart Eizenstat former ambassador to the European Union under Bill Clinton and Chief Domestic Policy Advisor to Jimmy Carter . </s>
Stuart Eizenstat : Number one , Israel is not a recruitment tool for terrorism as Roger said , it is absolutely not . They recruit on the basis of hatred toward the west and towards secular pro- western Arab states . Number two , Israel has shown when there is a peace partner Satad Egypt . King Hussein and George that they will negotiate that they will make concessions and peace will come when the Palestinian leadership demonstrates a commitment like Arafat , like Hussein did and like Sadat did . Third , let 's talk about concrete benefits . </s>
Israel does not just act on its own interest . </s>
If for example in the first Gulf War 1991 agreed with President George H.W . Bush not to retaliate against the barrage of Saddam Hussein 's scud missiles on Tel Aviv , staying in shelters so that President Bush could keep his coalition together in the first Gulf of war . </s>
Second , Israel gets concrete benefits by supporting the U.S. in terms of anti nuclear proliferation in the region destroying the nuclear reactor of Saddam Hussein in Iraq in 1981 , and more recently Syria’s budding nuclear facility supported by North Korea and standing shoulder to shoulder with the U.S. on the Iranian nuclear arms ambitions , and allowing the U.S. to take the lead on sanctions . Israel shares real time intelligence . I have seen it with the U.S. on terrorism and to the U.S. not simply at itself on rends nuclear capabilities . </s>
General Keegan , the Former Head of Air Force Intelligence said , `` I could not have obtained the same intelligence I receive from Israel if there were five CIAs . Israel also – John Donvan : Stuart , your time is up , but I will give you one more sentence to summarize . Stuart Eizenstat : Thank you . In terms of the economy itself which we have n't talked about . Israel serves as the location for every major American high-tech company developing cell phones and chips to keep America safe with passports - providing aerial vehicles to help our borders . </s>
John Donvan : Thank you , Stuart Eizenstat . Summarizing for the motion , the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel . Roger Cohen , a columnist and former foreign correspondent and foreign editor for the New York Times . </s>
Roger Cohen : Ladies and gentlemen , if you strip away all the rhetoric of the opposing team . In the end , what are they are arguing for ? They are arguing for more of the same . If you think more of the same is fine , if you think the growing hatreds , antagonism , estrangement in the area is just fine , then you should vote against the resolution and not for it , as we are arguing . </s>
I do n't believe that 's the case , I believe what 's going on is unhealthy and the United States by stepping back would put pressure on Israel to adjust its policies and open new avenues to the new Middle East of which President Obama has spoken . In the end , you have to put your backbone where your wish bone is , and what does America wish for ? </s>
Two states , Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and security . And as we have described , uncritical U.S. support of Israel in policies that undermine the possibility of two states is just a recipe for further failure . What does America also wish for under President Obama ? He wants a new relationship with the Islamic world . This will require more than just words and pretty speeches . </s>
It will require a new balance in the U.S. approach to the region a new readiness to speak to enemies , only then will we move forward . And if you think as Stu Eizenstat just suggested that if the United States succeeded in establishing a new and more harmonious relationship with the Islamic world this would have no effect whatsoever on the terrorist threat that the United States faces . Believe me , I think you are wrong . I would like to conclude with the words of Mahmoud Darwish , the great Palestinian poet who died last year and he wrote in his poem State of Siege , me or him that how war starts but it ends in awkward stances , me and him . It 's time for American policy to reflect better the him and the me of the Middle East . </s>
For all sorts of reasons this will not be easy , which is why ladies and gentlemen , you would help in this difficult adjustment by being courageous and voting for the proposition tonight . John Donvan : Thank you Roger Cohen . On a little bit of a course of these two statements turning into 2 minutes and 24 seconds , so I 'm going to give that to everybody . Our motion is U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel and summarizing his position against the motion . </s>
Itamar Rabinovich , former Israeli Ambassador to the United States and chief negotiator with Syria in the mid-1990s . </s>
Itamar Rabinovich : I want to look at the vision , the dream . The President of United States on Air Force One , landing at an airport in Gaza would n't that be a great moment . </s>
It already happened , Bill Clinton landed with Air Force One at an Air Force in Gaza in the late 1990s . There was an efforts by our opponent to describe a unilinear Israeli undermining of any effort to make peace between Israel and Palestinians to detriment of the region of the United States . But actually during the last 20 years and 30 years almost 40 years of the peace process that began in 1973 what kept the peace process going , it was American Israeli cooporation . There were some very high moments in this , the peace with Egypt , peace with Jordan . </s>
First Israeli visit to countries in the Gulf and in the North Africa and yes , Clinton landing in the Gaza strip , at an airport when it seemed that the Palestinian are underway to state of an independence before everything turned sour because of the change of mind of Yasser Arafat 's conduct that led to the disastrous consequences of the last decade 2000 to 2010 . Second , I think we had a problem , our debate was diverted tonight from debate on the U.S. Israeli special relationship to a debate on the Palestine problem , a very worthy subject , but not exactly that the focus of the issue . </s>
The issue is here is the Middle East a crucial part of the world , here is an Arab world 330 million people almost half a billion in decade or two . This is not all subjected to the Palestinian issue . </s>
There are many other issues . Iran was barely mentioned tonight . </s>
Now I tell you , you go to somebody who lives in Kuwait , or somebody who lives in Cairo , or somebody who lives in Oman and asking what is uppermost in your mind . And he would say , Iran . The Iranian threat , the Iranian bomb , the Iranian expansionism . </s>
And what do you expect . I expect the United States to protect me from Iran . John Donvan : Thank you . Itamar Rabinovich : Iran , the United States can do that – John Donvan : Thank you . Our motion is the U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel . </s>
Our final speaker to summaries his position for the motion Rashid Khalidi professor at Columbia University and former advisor to the Palestinian delegation for Arab Israeli peace negotiations . Rashid Khalidi : Thank you . You should vote for this proposition because it would end our record of failure in Palestinian Israeli peace making . And counter to the views of – what you just heard this is centrally important in the Middle East . You should vote for this proposition because it would stop the United States for enabling Israel in its worst habits of occupation and settlement , things that harm United States harm of course Palestinians but also harm Israel . </s>
Most importantly , you should vote for the proposition because it would help to bring peace and would be in the U.S. national interest . </s>
I 've said that if you do not vote for this proposition you are voting for the status quo . More process no peace . Now that is not the status quo that is stable , that is a status quo it is evolving , I would suggest in a fashion not favorable to I think most of the interests that most of us share . </s>
Let me read quote briefly , as long as in this territory west of the Jordon there is only one political entity called Israel . It is going to be either non Jewish or non democratic . </s>
Speaker continued if this block of millions of Palestinians can not vote this will become an apartheid state . This was not some anti-Semitism ; this is not some Israel passer ; this is Defense Minister of State of Israel , Ehud Barak speaking on the 3rd of February at Herzliya . That is status quo that is where it is going . It is in - ultimately a decision for the Israelis to take where they want to go , but we enable this , that is why you should vote for this proposition . </s>
And let me conclude by saying something about Iran . If Israel attacks Iran , in a situation where this special relation is unmodified , imagine if you will the impact on U.S. interests , on U.S. troops in Iraq , on the U.S. position in the Gulf and the Gulf itself . Now if this relationship remains unchanged , if United States is perceived as the hand maiden , the guardian , the enabler , of everything that Israel does we will be responsible when and if that catastrophic things happens . If Iran is a problem for the region not just for Israel , but it is not a problem to be resolved in the way that a lot of Israelis are pushing us to resolve it . </s>
That is why among many other reasons you should vote for the proposition . John Donvan : Thank you Rashid Khalidi . </s>
And that concludes our closing statements and now it 's time to learn which side you feel argued best , we are going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat . </s>
Our motion is that U.S. should step back from its special relationship with Israel if you agree with the motion now , push number 1 , if you disagree , push number 2 . If you remain undecided , push number 3 . Or if you became undecided push number 3 . And if you - if somebody is having some trouble , if you push the wrong button just push it , the one you want to correct with and it will lock it . All right , so we are very close to getting the results which I think we are locking out and are being tabulated at the moment . So , before I get to those , first of all I want to thank our panelist for coming here in the spirit of listening as well as debating . I also want to thank the people in the audience who asked questions because there was n't a clunker among them . </s>
Thank you all for your questions as well . I thought they are pretty good . Some future announcements . </s>
Our next day will be Tuesday March 16th , the motion then is Do n't Blame Teacher Unions For Our failing Schools . Panelist for the motion are Kate McLaughlin , math teacher from Lowell , Massachusetts Gary Smuts who is Superintendent of the ABC Unified School District in California and Randi Weingarten who is president of the American Federation of Teachers . Against the motion , Terry Moe , Professor of Political Science at Stanford , Rod Paige , former U.S. Secretary of Education and Larry Sands , the former teacher and president of California Teachers Empowerment Network . Intelligence Squared U.S. going to announce a change in our topic for the May 11th debate . </s>
The new motion for that debate is going to be this , Obama 's foreign policy is gift to America 's enemies . With the Obama presidency now entering its second year , the administrations foreign policy taking shape and voices of many political opponents and even some supporters beginning to challenge his decisions we felt the time was right for a thoughtful debate on this topic . And actually debaters are booked now and we will announce soon . </s>

I picked up the wrong one . Nothing happened . </s>
Before the debate , 33 % of you were for the motion , 42 % of you were against the motion , 25 % were undecided that the U.S. should step back from a special relationship with Israel . After the debate , 49 % agree with the motion , 47 % are against , 4 % undecided . For the motion are our winners , congratulations to them . Thanks to all of you from me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'd like to thank all of you for coming and to introduce the founder and chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S. , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Thank you very much , and welcome to the first debate of our fall season . We 're excited to be back and pleased to see such a nice turnout . This crowd was not terrorized by the weather . This is our 51st debate , but it 's our first with Slate as our media partner and our first for our new relationship with PBS and WNET as our television outlet . </s>
We 're delighted to have such first class partners , joining our effort to improve the quality of our public discourse . So to our resolution tonight , `` It 's time to end the War on Terror . '' Ideologically , the appeal of terrorism as a way to redress grievances has been undermined . </s>
The Arab Spring has accomplished far more through largely peaceful means than Al-Qaeda ever accomplished through violence . Tactically , the balance has shifted . Osama bin Laden was uniquely charismatic and inspirational , with large financial resources . </s>
Now he 's dead as are most of his lieutenants . Al-Qaeda 's leadership is fractured ; its communications primitive ; its financing highly constrained ; and its operational capabilities severely limited . We achieved this result by expending enormous resources for intelligence surveillance , drone attacks and brilliantly coordinated raids , but the Al-Qaeda war was never going to be ended by a peace treaty . History , however , has moved on ; and it 's time for us to move on as well . The War on Terror no longer makes sense as an organizing principle for U.S. policy . </s>
But what 's the counter argument to all of this ? </s>
It is that we can not simply declare victory and shift our concerns elsewhere . Terrorist attacks are still occurring with depressing frequency in Iraq and Afghanistan . Pakistan 's duplicity has been exposed , but it remains a nuclear power with destabilizing , radical Islamic elements . </s>
Suicide bombers are still an asymmetric threat and a tactic to be reckoned with . America 's hated as much as ever by Islamic jihadists who certainly have the desire to inflict mass casualties on us through whatever means they can obtain . This is not the time to bask in the glow of victory but rather the time to maintain the vigilance that has kept us safe during the decade we 're about to mark this week . </s>
But which is the better argument ? It 's up to you to decide ; and to help you make that decision , we 've assembled an extraordinary panel of experts . Before I turn the evening over to them and to our moderator John Donvan , I 'd like to invite Jacob Weisberg , editor and chief of the Slate Group to say a word . </s>
Bob , thank you . </s>
We at Slate could n't be more excited about becoming Intelligence Squared 's media partner . You know , from our start which is 15 years ago , Slate 's been all about the value of debate and conversation , the dialogue that the web allows you to have instead of what you might think of as the monologue in print . And I 've seen that same approach embodied in the Intelligence Squared debates , both as a participant -- which , to my relief , I 'm not tonight -- and as a member of the audience . </s>
Like Slate , Intelligence Squared is committed to the view that serious argument can be entertaining and that ideas and policy can be fun . On our site , we 're hoping to extend these conversations in both directions . We 're going to run pieces , articles to help frame the subjects in advance ; and we want to continue the conversation after the event is over . </s>
This is n't the only debate we 'll be covering , but we have a reporter here tonight in case you want to read tomorrow and read a journalist 's take on what took place . I should say we 've had a terrific time already working with Bob , with Dana Wolfe and their amazing team to help craft the propositions for the fall season ; and we hope we 've got a roster of ones that will prove both urgent and engaging . </s>
So the subject we 're starting out with tonight , which Bob framed extremely well , could n't be more vital in its importance to the city of New York , to the country and to the world . So I do n't want to delay it any further . I will turn it over to get things under way . It 's my privilege to give you John Donvan . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Jacob . And Jacob , you were a very good debater , by the way . So I 'd just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz and Jacob Weisberg . True or false : `` It is time to end the War on Terror . '' That 's what we are here to debate . </s>
This is another verbal match-up from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We 're at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University and on hundreds of NPR stations across the nation . `` It 's time to end the War on Terror . '' </s>
Two teams will be arguing that proposition from opposite sides for it and against it . And all of our debaters come at this topic from firsthand experience . They include security expert Peter Bergen , who as a journalist , interviewed Osama bin Laden in 1997 and sent out some of the earliest warning signals . Ladies and gentlemen , Peter Bergen . </s>
Peter , we 're doing a preliminary introduction and then -- You know what ? </s>
You know what ? Peter did exactly what we asked him to do . </s>
But we forgot to tell him it was going to happen twice . And that 's our fault . My apologies . His debating partner , Juliette Kayyem , who in the Obama administration was an assistant secretary for Homeland Security . </s>
Opposing them at the facing table , Mike Hayden , who ran the CIA and before that , the National Security Agency -- -- and Richard Falkenrath , who advised President Bush on Homeland Security , then moved to New York City to become deputy commissioner of Counterterrorism . So all four of these people know what they are talking about , and yet they disagree on calling an end to the War on Terror . All of them are dedicated to winning you over to their point of view here in our live audience because you , our live audience , are the judges in this debate , and that 's what this is . It is a contest . </s>
There will be winners and losers . And in this contest , you will decide who wins . We 're going to ask you , by the time the debate has been concluded , to vote twice -- once before and once again afterwards ; and the team that has changed its numbers the most , changed most of your minds , will be named our winner . So let 's go first to the preliminary vote . </s>
You each have keypads at your seats . Our motion is this . `` It 's time to end the War on Terror . '' If you agree with this proposition , push number one . If you disagree , push number two ; and if you 're undecided , push number three . </s>
And if you feel that you made an error in the process , just correct it , and the system will lock in your most recent vote . It looks like everybody 's done . </s>
So to remind you again , that vote will be tabulated immediately , but we 'll hold the result till the end of the debate to tell what you that base number is ; and then we 'll have you vote once again at the end of the evening , and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared out winner . So on to the debate , round one , opening statements from each debater in turn . </s>
Our motion is this : `` It 's time to end the War on Terror . '' And speaking first for the motion , I 'd like to introduce Peter Bergen , a CNN national security analyst . </s>
He 's director of National Security Studies at the New America Foundation and a best-selling author . In 1997 , he traveled to Afghanistan and conducted Osama bin Laden 's first television interview . And Peter , I just want to share with you the fact that even your opponents can see that your knowledge of the operational details of terrorist groups is encyclopedic . I do n't know if that 's a psych-out -- </s>
-- or not , but I hope you can take it as a compliment . I do . Okay . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Peter Bergen . </s>
Thank you . First of all , Juliette and I wanted to acknowledge the three and a half decades of public service that General Hayden has done and also Richard Falkenrath 's more than a decade of public service . I also wanted to acknowledge Juliette Kayyem 's decade and a half of public service where she became the highest ranking Arab-American in the Obama administration , the assistant secretary to the Department of Homeland Security . She also had three kids that she raised at the same time , putting home into Homeland Security in a meaningful sense -- -- and is one of the world 's leading experts on the question of homeland security . </s>
My own connection to the story came when the Trade Center was bombed for the first time in '93 . I traveled to Afghanistan , produced a documentary about the threat we face from Afghanistan and then , of course , interviewed bin Laden . </s>
I 've written three books on the subject of Al-Qaeda . I 've embedded with our troops on multiple occasions in Iraq and Afghanistan . From a self-interested point of view , I have every incentive to say the threat that Al-Qaeda and terrorism poses to us remains very serious . </s>
And it merits on open-ended conflict against them ; but in good conscience , I simply ca n't make that argument . War is no longer the most appropriate way to look at the problems we face today . Our singular focus on terrorism also masks many more pressing problems . Our crumbling infrastructure , our decaying schools , deeply serious economic problems . Another national security problem is managing the future of the Arab Spring , for instance ; preventing nuclear war between Pakistan and India ; preventing a nuclear war between North Korea and South Korea ; managing the rise of China which , while we’ve been distracted by the War on Terror , has quietly expanded its influence in Africa and in Southeast Asia . </s>
Our opponents want to prolong the War on Terror , an open-ended conflict against a tactic that is already America 's longest war . We 're saying it 's time for war to end . President Obama correctly redefined this conflict downwards from a global open-ended conflict against the tactic to the more precise formulation of a war against Al-Qaeda and its allies , which both names the enemy and narrows the focus of the conflict . </s>
When we say it 's time for the War on Terror to end , we do n't mean we should precipitously pull out of Afghanistan , but we do mean that it 's time to stop conceiving our principle national security goal as the defeat of terrorists when putting , for instance , our own economic house in order will do far more to prepare us for the next real war we 'll inevitably face at some point in the future . The War on Terror , as everybody in the audience knows , has caused the American public at least a trillion dollars in expenditure and wars around the world and , of course , got us into the catastrophic Iraq War ; further trillions on our -- both our Intelligence and Homeland National Security apparatus resulted in policies such as coercive interrogations and extraordinary renditions . </s>
And you 'll hear from my partner that the government has for years anyway moved away from the War on Terror and what it entails , not because there was no threat . We 're not claiming that at all but because the threat has changed and has adapted and so we must -- we as well . Key American National Security officials now say that Al-Qaeda 's on its last leg . John Brennan , who , of course , is President Obama 's chief counterterrorism adviser , said that just last week . </s>
Leon Panetta said that the strategic defeat of Al-Qaeda is within sight . </s>
General David Petraeus has made the same sort of comments recently . None of these gentlemen can be considered to be defeatist or soft on terrorism . So is this premature triumphalism the claim that Al-Qaeda is on its last legs ? </s>
Well , I think the claim is well-justified . I mean , the leadership of Al-Qaeda 's been completely decimated in the campaign of drone attacks . </s>
The most dangerous job in the world right now has been Al-Qaeda 's number two . </s>
There have been about 20 of them since 2008 , including most recently , the group 's number two out here , Atiyah Abd al-Rahman , who was killed just a few weeks -- just about a week ago . Al-Qaeda has n't carried out a successful attack in the West since the 7/7 attacks in London six years ago . Al-Qaeda has n't killed a single American in the United States since 9/11 . And think about the real wars we 've really confronted . The Civil War threatened to tear this country apart . </s>
World War II , we defeated an enemy that instigated a global conflict to kill tens of millions , and if the Cold War had ended with a bang instead of whimper , we 'd all be not in this debate because we 'd all be dead . Those are serious threats . The War on Terror -- the threat we faced from Al-Qaeda does n't come close ; and in fact , only 17 Americans have died as a result of Al-Qaeda 's ideological ideas in this country , 13 of them , of course , at Fort Hood and others in other places . More Americans accidentally die in their own bathtubs every year by considerable numbers around 300 , and we do n't have an unreasonable fear of bathtubs ; so we should n't have an unreasonable fear of Al-Qaeda . And by terrorism , we 're terrified , by the way , of course , and we 're doing the job of the terrorist for them if we live in this state of constant fear that our opponents wish us to live in . </s>
And everybody in the audience knows very well that the threat from terrorism is actually dramatically receded in the years since the 9/11 attacks ; and that 's in part because Al-Qaeda and bin Laden have been losing the war of ideas in the Muslim world for years . Their founder and leader was killed , as you know , in Abbottabad on the evening of May 1st . </s>
In the Arab Spring , there 's not a single revolutionary who 's carrying a single picture of Osama bin laden . Bin Laden 's ideas have been completely absent from the Arab Spring . There has n't been a single flag burning in the Arab Spring of an American flag or even an Israeli flag ; so bin Laden 's foot soldiers , ideas and leadership are simply absent from this enormously important phenomenon in the Arab world . Our opponents may claim that we 're still threatened by terrorists armed with weapons of mass destruction . This claim , of course , follows simply the disastrous war in Iraq ; and in fact , the 188 jihadi terrorist cases in this country since 9/11 , not a single one of them involved chemical , biological , radiological and nuclear weapons . </s>
We will no doubt hear from our opponents that to argue the War on Terrorism is overly soft or unrealistic or weak -- and they make claim that , at some point , we will decide we no longer need to define it as a War on Terror , but we are n't there yet . </s>
I would submit to you in the audience , if the death of the founder and leader of Al-Qaeda is n't the point where we can say the War on Terror is over and then add to that the destruction of almost its entire top leadership , its absence in the revolutions across the Middle East , its inability to mount any kind of attack on the United States for a decade is n't the point to end the War on Terror , when will that point be ? We say it 's now . </s>
Thank you , Peter Bergen . Our proposition is `` It 's time to end the War on Terror , '' and here to speak against this motion , Michael Hayden , an Air Force four-star general . He 's former director of the National Security Agency and the Central Intelligence Agency . </s>
He has overseen virtually every branch of the Intelligence community . He is now a principal at the Chertoff Group as is his debating partner , Richard Falkenrath . </s>
And I understand , Mike , you have a great deal of Pittsburgh in you -- I do ? -- and that Pittsburgh returned the affection by naming a highway , a stretch of highway after you . Actually , it 's a street right next to Heinz Field ; and the first question I asked was `` Can I park there during football games ? '' How do you work that out ? </s>
Do you just drive up and down your street all the time -- -- looking at the signs ? Take the grandkids -- Ladies and gentlemen , Michael Hayden . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Well , good evening . Thanks for the opportunity to talk about such an important topic , and it really is an important topic . It 's not something that we should just decide idly . </s>
It 's not something we should decide because we 're really in a celebratory mood . When I -- when I talk to audiences about the War on Terror , I generally refer to a speech I gave at the German Embassy in the spring of 2007 . The Germans were in the chair of the European Union , and the German ambassador would have the ambassadors to the United States from the European Union over for lunch about every two weeks and would have an American come in to kind of be the lunchtime entertainment , and it was my turn . </s>
I decided that the German ambassador was a good friend , and he deserved a good speech ; and I decided I would talk to the European Union delegates about renditions , detentions and interrogations that were being conducted by the CIA at that time . About page two or three of that speech , I wanted to make very clear to my audience what I thought , what my agency thought and what I think my nation thought . And I gave them four sentences . `` We believe we are a nation at war . '' `` We are at war with Al-Qaeda and its affiliates '' -- the description that Peter just gave and that President Obama emphasized that reflected what we were thinking several years earlier . </s>
`` A nation at war '' ; `` At war with Al-Qaeda and its affiliates '' ; `` This war is global in scope '' ; and `` We can only fulfill our moral and ethical responsibilities to you , the citizens of this republic , by taking this fight to this enemy wherever he may be . '' George Tenet was the DCI , the Director of Central Intelligence . </s>
In 1999 , sent a note out to all of us in the Intelligence community , saying `` We 're at war with Al-Qaeda . '' And George was but America was n't . America went to war with Al-Qaeda shortly after the attacks on September 11 , 2001 . Two successive American presidents have defined us as being at war with Al-Qaeda . The American Congress has defined us as being at war with Al-Qaeda ; and the American court system , only a few blocks from here , has defined us as being at war with Al-Qaeda when a defendant , attempting to claim he had been denied his right to a speedy trial because he had been in detention for several years , his claim was rejected by the court , saying we , as a nation at war , had a right to detain him as a combatant . </s>
Now , we could discuss troop levels in Iraq , the rate of withdrawal from Afghanistan , a whole bunch of other details about this war , but that 's not the point I think Rich and I want to make . The point we want to make is the legal construct -- the legal belief that we are a nation at war ; that we are a nation in conflict ; and we have a right , because we are in that status , to use the legal tools and the legal authorities that a nation at war is allowed to use . What it is we 're supporting is to keep all available tools on the table -- to keep a menu of options from law enforcement , diplomacy , or to arm conflict in order to keep you safe . I would also add -- and I really want to emphasis this -- that conceiving yourself at war in addition to whatever it is you might do in a law enforcement channel is not somehow lawless . It is perfectly lawful . </s>
It is a different lawful approach than a law enforcement approach , but it is consistent with the laws of armed conflict that we have a right to resort to in order to defend ourselves . I assume everyone here is happy that Osama bin Laden was killed on the morning of the second of May in Pakistan . </s>
Let me give you -- thank you . Let me give you a slightly different description of that event . A heavily armed agent of the United States government was in a room with an unarmed man who was under indictment in the United States judicial system and was offering no significant resistance to the heavily armed agent of the United States government , and that heavily armed agent of the United States government killed him . </s>
If you do not think we are at war , there are some very troubling definitions that you might want to attach to that act . That 's the kind of authority we have perfectly lawful -- and no way am I suggesting anyone acted inappropriately . </s>
We acted perfectly lawfully because we are a nation at war and generally recognized as such . You do n't want to take those tools off the table while there are terrorists out there . </s>
If you let this tool go , you will be less safe . Okay . If you look at the scope of our constitutional system , the law enforcement approach is designed , if you look at the constitution , the Bill of Rights and the American statutory law , the law enforcement approach is designed to make the government weak because we do n't want the government arbitrarily taking away your liberties . On the other hand , if you look at those sections of the Constitution that deal with armed conflict , they 're designed to make the government strong so that it can protect you . </s>
You do n't want to take that tool off the table . And quite perversely , if you take that tool off the table , you may actually threaten your own civil liberties . </s>
Bear with me . </s>
There 's a tight connection here . If the options of a nation at war are taken away from your tool kit , you must then rely on the options offered by law enforcement . If you recall the events in -- on Christmas day a year or two ago , Detroit , Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab , the `` Underwear Bomber '' -- and he was Mirandized after about 50 minutes of interrogation , and I think everyone recognized that was probably a mistake . We should have interrogated him further . We had the attorney general talking to the American Congress about legislation that would make Miranda more malleable so that we could interrogate these kinds of people longer in our law enforcement approach . </s>
I do n't want to make Miranda more malleable . </s>
Miranda defends me . Defends you . </s>
Defends your rights . And we 're forced to contort the law enforcement approach when we attempt to make it answer and deal with questions it was never designed to deal with . </s>
This is one of those questions . </s>
Do n't take that other tool , `` We are a nation of war '' off the table . Thank you . Thank you , Michael Hayden . Our motion is `` It 's time to end the War on Terror . '' We are now halfway through opening remarks of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have four debaters , two teams of two , fighting it out over our motion , our proposition , `` It 's time to end the War on Terror . '' You have heard two of the opening statements , and now on to the third . I want to introduce Juliette Kayyem , who , as I said at the beginning of the debate , these people on the stage really have had their hands in the business that they 're talking about . </s>
So her resume includes stints at the Justice Department , former assistant secretary to the Department of Homeland Security , the national security and foreign policy columnist for The Boston Globe . </s>
You 've also served as chief of Homeland Security in the state of Massachusetts . </s>
You 're a faculty member at Harvard 's Kennedy School a Government ; a mother of three , we 've heard earlier , and often described as the Obama administration 's highest ranking senior Arab-American female official . Wow . </s>
Wow . So which of those -- Tells you how many . Which of those items is the most relevant ? </s>
American . American . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Juliette Kayyam . So I want to thank Bob and Dana , Peter , Mike and Rich and the organizers of Intelligence Squared ; and I also want to take a moment to acknowledge , obviously , tonight , 10 years later and the tragedy and burdens this city has suffered . We will debate with passion here but with the full acknowledgement that many of you suffered tremendously . The proposition I 'm arguing for tonight is the War on Terror is over . That can mean a lot of things , obviously . </s>
For me , it means one thing . </s>
A certain mind-set came to be known as the `` War on Terror , '' and that mind-set , thankfully , is over . </s>
To explain what I mean , I want to tell you a story . I did reenter government in 2006 when Governor Deval Patrick became governor of Massachusetts ; and one of my duties was to oversee the Massachusetts National Guard . I inherited a program that had been established on September 12 which was to put National Guard members on the roadways , leading up to our only nuclear facility , Pilgrim facility , and it was understandable in those days , you wanted to show greater force protection . More than five years later , they were still there , the National Guard members . </s>
Despite the tremendous work being done to counter the terrorist threat and despite no evidence that terrorists would seek to enter by road a heavily fortified facility , nobody involved with intricacies of that security thought that they were still necessary , but no one really knew how to pivot . </s>
It 's very hard to pivot . And the political military and public input had to be aligned . It took us awhile , but eventually we did move on , and I tell that story not as evidence that the terrorist threat is over , not at all . </s>
I tell it to say that there were other procedures that we then put in place , more aggressive surveillance , sharing better surveillance of the streets , better communications between the nuclear facility owners and the local first responders that we instituted instead of the 19 National Guard members rotating 24/7 . I tell this story to remind you that 10 years is a long time . It is a long time to fight any war but one particularly where the enemy has changed so dramatically . And over that time , there had been a whole range of shifts in every jurisdiction in the federal government that had been similar to the one I just described . </s>
So to just call the ongoing efforts to dismantle , kill and disrupt Al-Qaeda and its affiliates a continuity or continuation of The War on Terror -- capital T , capital W , capital T -- is to treat the United States and the government apparatus established since 9/11 as frozen in time . It assumes that there has been no learning , no growth , no perspectives achieved , no recognition of mistakes made , no priority shifts , no advancements in our abilities and capabilities . It assumes that time had stood still for us . </s>
In many respects this debate actually is a few years too late . The War on Terror , as it became known , was an entire government ideology , based on the notion that Islamic terrorism represented a unified and operationally centralized threat to manning a predominantly military response with the President as commander in chief who could use any means necessary . Nobody , especially people who have served in National Security , denied that there is still a terrorist threat , and the U.S. Government , under any administration , to pick up on General Hayden 's point , is going to have a variety of tools to use to combat that threat , including military force . Nobody needs to make apologies for that , neither the left nor the right . The authorization for the use of military force passed immediately after 9/11 , gave the President and the future ones the legal authorization to fight Al-Qaeda with force . </s>
It is still the law today , and it is still good law ; but the fact that the government continues to use many of these same counterterrorism strategies , including killing bin Laden , of course , does not mean that the War on Terror and all that it entailed remain because we should go through the list -- the enhanced interrogation , the dark side , the with us or against us , the indiscriminate interviewing a particular Arab and Muslim communities , the registration of Arab immigrants , military tribunals that adhere to standards unrecognized in military law , the color code alerts , the breathless press conferences , the rejection of the law of wars , the treating of the Geneva Conventions as quaint , secret wiretapping and violation of established law , the disdain for the judiciary -- those were also part of that war . And thankfully , they are over , and they began to be over during the Bush administration and the continuation in this administration . It has not been more of the same , and that is good because we got better . Over these 10 years during both Bush and Obama administrations , the U.S. Security apparatus became more focused and sophisticated . </s>
It was because the threat had changed . It was more decentralized and disparate , and we have adapted to that , certainly , by using military tactics to kill Al-Qaeda affiliates worldwide , but we have also become more focused , measuring success by effectiveness over shear activity . And nowhere is this more true than in Homeland Security . Unlike war , Homeland Security is very bottom up . </s>
It begins with locals who run police departments or emergency management divisions or public health facilities . It is overseen by mayors and governors , and if you want to talk about a change in America , there 's only one governor who was governor on 9/11 still in the State House , and he 's debating in California right now because he does n't want to be governor anymore . That 's Rick Perry . </s>
So , I mean , there 's just been tremendous change over these 10 years ; and so calling it a War on Terror for them does not help them manage budget or defend certain programs or know actually how to prioritize . As Rich Falkenrath -- who helped institutionalize the phrase `` dual-use '' policies that help the cop on the street in fighting crime as well as in counterterrorism ; that provide training for emergency managers for a tower falling as well as Hurricane Irene -- these are the most sustainable and effective . The color-code system seemed appropriate in an era that created a warlike climate but provided no clarity to the first responders on how to -- how to react , and the public rightfully rejected it . More localized efforts to engage immigrant communities or in nationally adopting to `` See Something , Say Something '' campaign that came out of New York City are good and effective government action , and they are necessary as we have reason to be concerned with radicalization in our own nation . None of these require military engagement or mind-set although , of course , as I 've said , there might be a need for military engagement , and it 's authorized by law . </s>
These are smart strategies adopted by people across the ideological spectrum . </s>
I am here not because I have some invested intellectual interest in saying the war is over . </s>
Military efforts will need to be utilized . That goes without saying . But do not forget what the War on Terror was , and do not forget how much progress we have made in moving past it . What has replaced it is a different way of thinking about the threat and our response . </s>
Surely , not everything is perfect , but criticism is accepted . There is nothing soft or weak or liberal about believing the War on Terror is over . It is actually the way the world is ; and ask yourself `` Are we less safe now from having moved on ? '' </s>
Thank you , Juliette Kayyam . Our motion is `` It 's time to end the War on Terror . '' And here to speak fourth and against the motion , Richard Falkenrath , who has served as deputy commissioner for Counterterrorism of the New York City Police Department and as deputy , Homeland Security advisor to President Bush during the Bush Administration , obviously . And Richard , I do n't know if you know this , but coincidentally , we lived on the same street in Washington during that period , and all of the neighbors had a habit of watching your face as you would come home from work every day to try to figure out if we were in trouble or not . </s>
And I just wanted to congratulate you on your poker face . Oh , thank you . And we never knew . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Richard Falkenrath . That was a scary time , and happily it 's over . Now , forgive my voice . </s>
I 've got a little bit of a cold . It 's a great pleasure to be here . </s>
Thank you to the organizers , the sponsors , to the other panelists , all of whom are long and close friends . We 've known each other for a long time . Debates like this often turn on trying to convince the audience , the voters , of a definition ; and if you get them thinking about a proposition defined your way , it 's clear which side should prevail , and if you get them thinking about a proposition defined the other way , it 's clear which side should prevail . And this is no exception to that rule . </s>
The War on Terror is a very open-ended concept , and it can be construed in many different ways . And Peter and Juliette are -- construe it in a way that really is n't that surprising , but they were very candid about it , frankly , which is they 'd like it to be defined as a certain mind-set that we experienced some point in the past that we no longer should have today . And I find , if I were probably -- if I was on their side of the proposition , I 'd argue it the same way because this is a tough one to argue if you argue it the way Mike and I think it should be argued which , in fact , Juliette agrees with , which is you need to make this an operational proposition . You need to define it in some very precise way so there 's something really to weigh in on . </s>
It 's not just some squishy mind-set and set of feelings . It 's actually something practical . And here , in fact , it is something practical . War on Terror -- war is a legal state , as Mike said . It exists in law . </s>
It is decreed by Congress and , in fact , they did decree it in this case with the authorization for the use of military force , passed by Congress on Sept. 14 , signed by President Bush on Sept. 18 , and still in force today . </s>
And the way I understand this proposition that we 're voting on here , is essentially -- `` Should we repeal or modify this in some way or another ? '' And Mike and I say , `` No , we should n't . This should still stand . '' Juliette also agrees with us . She thinks it should stand too . </s>
I 'm not sure where Peter is . But it 's worth noting exactly what is says because this is what it means to be in a War on Terror . It means to have this as your law of the land . It says that the President is authorized to use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations , organizations or persons he determines planned , authorized , committed or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11th or harbored such organizations or persons in order to prevent any further acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations , organizations or persons . </s>
Now , our position is quite simple : it 's that this should stay the law of the land . This should be the law in the United States , because , if it 's not , then something Peter said is no longer the case : having the number two job in al-Qaeda is no longer the most dangerous job in the world . It is today . And he 's still there . The number two in al-Qaeda -- it 's much , much diminished , decimated probably is n't too strong a word for al-Qaeda . </s>
But the number two officer in al- Qaeda on 9/11 , Ayman al-Zawahiri , a shadow of the man bin Laden was , he 's still alive . </s>
He 's in Pakistan . But for this provision of law , we ca n't use military force unilaterally against him . This is what makes such action lawful , and without this , the alternative is to go arrest him , mirandize him , bring him back to the court , which is an option , which frankly I do n't believe should be taken off the table , either . Probably not what we will end up pursuing in his case . </s>
But it simply makes no sense . It makes no sense to say you should repeal this . So that 's my sort of first big point to you , is this is the law of the land . </s>
The war on Terror is a legal state that gives us opportunities to do things under the code of law , not extra-legally , so , if that commando team does go in and kill someone , it 's not murder . It is , in fact , an act of war . Blessed by both branches of government -- the judiciary -- the executive and the legislative -- and without this , illegal . So , we do n't want that . </s>
And this strikes me as , clearly , sensible to continue . Now , should it continue indefinitely ? Who knows ? </s>
I 'm not prepared to say exactly when it should stop . </s>
But right now , today , when we know , some of the perpetrators of 9/11 are still at liberty , presumably in Pakistan . It really makes no sense whatsoever to repeal this . Now , Juliette and Peter would have us think instead about the proposition in a different way , and say , “It 's about a mindset.” It 's about that terrible state when John referred to when neighbors would look at a Senior White House Official 's face to see how it was when he came home from work . Those days are happily over , and hopefully they 'll never come back . </s>
That 's really not the proposition here . </s>
Yes , there were lots of that we 're -- if we want to have another proposition which was , did President Bush overdo it in the first four years after 9/11 , that 's a whole different debate . And maybe , they will prevail on that one . We 're debating a different proposition here . This is not about whether we think President Bush got it just right in the first couple of years after 9/11 or not . This is also not really a partisan issue . </s>
And yeah , I worked for Bush . But I also worked for Mike Bloomberg . He -- who knows what he is . I mean , he was a -- -- now he 's independent . </s>
Then he was a Republican . At one point , he was a Democrat . This is not really a partisan thing . </s>
But Peter made an interesting point . He said President Obama has more correctly and more precisely characterized the continued offensive action against Al- Qaeda and its affiliates . And he 's absolutely right , that the president -- President Obama 's rhetoric is very different from President Bush 's . They talked about it very differently . </s>
But the practice -- the nitty-gritty of what happens in counter-terrorism internationally , operationally , from the last four years of the Bush administration to today , in 9/11 -- not only is it fundamentally unchanged . Obama is tougher . He is harsher . </s>
He is sharper . I 'll give you just one example . I understand -- Mike probably knows this -- I just hear it from the news . There is a list of individuals who may be targeted , by name , individually , for lethal air strikes . Under -- that list started under Bush . </s>
I think it notified to Congress . </s>
Under Bush , that list consisted of only non-U.S . persons . So , foreigners . If we are to believe what we read in the paper , President Obama has added a U.S. citizen to that list , who may be targeted by name . </s>
This is an extremely liberal , former constitutional law professor who has added a U.S. citizen to a list of people who may be targeted by name . Now , he does it because of this aspect of law , which consists today . That individual , Anwar Al-Awlaki , is in Yemen . </s>
He 's a U.S. citizen . He is vulnerable to lethal strike today that are lawful under U.S. law . I submit today it makes no sense to repeal that law at this time , and thus , under the terms of this debate and the War on Terror . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Mr. Falkenrath . And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate , where the motion being argued is , it is time to end the War on Terror . Keep in mind how you voted at the top of the evening . </s>
We 're going to ask you to vote again at the end of the debate , and reminding you that the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . Now , before we go on to Round 2 , I want to correct a mistake I made in the pronunciation of Juliette’s surname . And I just want to -- not just to be nice -- I want to actually say it again as I said it at the beginning of the program , so that it can be edited correctly into the radio broadcast . And so , I 'm going to say and then I 'd love it if you clapped with as much -- -- fervor as you did the first time . And Peter 's partner , Juliette Kayyem , who -- in the Obama Administration -- was an Assistant Security for Homeland Security . </s>
Yeah . </s>
Yeah . I apologize . I really think name pronunciation is entirely unforgivable , so you do n't even have to forgive me , okay ? So , now onto Round 2 , where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from the audience and from me . We 're here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . </s>
We have two teams of two arguing this motion -- “It is Time to End the War on Terror.” The side arguing for that proposition -- Juliette Kayyem and Peter Bergen -- are arguing that it never made sense to call our response to September 11th “The War , ” and that in any case , the enemy that provoked that war -- Al-Qaeda -- is now on its last legs . Arguing against the motion -- that it 's too soon end the War on Terror -- Michael Hayden and Richard Falkenrath . Their view , that there are still enemies out there , dedicated to hurting us . </s>
And as -- that as long they are there , calling it a war gives the government the tools and the powers that it needs to protect the people . </s>
So , I want to ask a question to the side that 's arguing that it 's time to end the War on Terror . And it 's this : Do our enemies have any say in telling us whether this is a war or not ? </s>
If they are there , and they want to hurt us , and even if Al-Qaeda had been -- had been put on the run , it was clear in the documents that were recovered from Osama Bin Laden 's hideout , that they were still trying . And as long as they 're still trying -- as long as it 's a war to them , can we say that it 's not a war to us ? </s>
Well , there 's a very substantial difference between it -- Peter Bergen . I mean , sure , there was often -- when , in Bin Laden 's house , in Abbottabad , or after all these blue sky plans to attack us on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 . </s>
I think I can tell you right now , that 's not going to happen . These were blue sky plans . </s>
These were kind of doodlings of a guy was basically spending five years with his three wives , with not much to do -- and thinking about , you know , like , some sort of grotesque parody of a Dr . </s>
No James Bond , sort of sitting there , coming up with -- plotting mayhem . But these were not , you know , the government itself -- DHS -- has said you know , that you know , these were -- there was nothing there then . There was no operation . He was essentially somebody who history had sidelined . </s>
You know , President Obama has said something I think is quite accurate . </s>
“He 's a small man on the wrong side of history.” And history just sped up for them , with the Arab Spring and the death of Bin Laden . And for us to sort of live in a state of constant fear that they 're going to do something to us is to basically hand them a victory that they did n't even have -- Let 's hear from Richard Falkenrath . -- when he was alive . </s>
The direct answer to your question , John , is no , they do n't . Whether we are at war or not is up to the United States and its constitutional authority to decide . </s>
But Peter did something once again that he did in his opening remarks , which is try to get you to think that we somehow stand for the proposition that you should live in constant fear forever , and it should never go away . That 's absolutely not what we 're saying . </s>
Nothing could be further from the truth . I worked for the NYPD . </s>
Our job is not to make the people feel unsafe in their communities . We want people to feel safe . That 's why you show up to work in the morning and do your job . </s>
So , just , let 's be clear . </s>
We 're at War on Terror . We have this continued legal status of a War on Terror so that everyone does n't live in constant fear . Okay , okay -- </s>
Juliette Kayyem . </s>
-- I 'm a lawyer , and let me tell you what the AUMF says . Because I agree with it . And I agree with them . I thought the question was , should the War on Terror continue ? So , I did n't bring my legal books . </s>
But if you want to view the War on Terror as solely a legal issue -- the authorization for the use of military force is because of a debate between -- hard to imagine that they actually debated this after September 11th -- is limited to Al-Qaeda and its affiliates . </s>
And it gives the President authorization to use a whole bunch of tools -- including military action -- but a whole bunch of them , to fight Al-Qaeda -- those responsible for 9/11 -- and its affiliates . That 's what it does . And that is great . And we should continue to support it . But why is that -- </s>
But under that not everything was done under the AUMF . First of all , this notion of a War on Terror justified -- and we can get into a legal argument . And I did this for a while , so I 'm happy to get into a legal argument . The Authorization for the Use of Military Force was limited both in terms of its target , and did not initiate a War on Terror . </s>
But let 's also not forget their legal analysis . Their legal analysis -- if you want to talk law -- was actually that because it was a War on Terror , Congress in many ways could not limit the President 's authority in a number of items that we can remember -- that we can all go through . So , if we 're going to debate law , let 's debate the law as they interpreted it . But we 're not here to debate law , because that 's not why -- that 's -- Michael Hayden . </s>
-- too easy . </s>
Right . It 's too easy to debate the law , because then , actually , I 'm on their side . Then I should n't have shown up . </s>
Michael Hayden . I just want to add , whatever label we put on it -- “War on Terror” or “War Against Al-Qaeda , ” it still is the legal authority under which we operate , but against Al-Qaeda and its affiliates . That all we have been doing -- all that we have done , has been designed against that opposing armed enemy force -- Al-Qaeda and its affiliates . </s>
So , do n't be confused by the labels . All along , despite whatever the rhetoric may have been , we used -- again -- the tools of our own conflict against a specific set of enemies , authorized by the Congress of the United States . But do you hear your opponent saying that 's as a practical matter -- as almost a cultural matter - - the term “war” suggests much more than the issue of a legal authorization -- that it does reflect a mindset , and taking a side is keeping a population in fear . And that charge -- it does reflect a mindset , a commitment to discussion over resources , a discussion over sacrifice , that talking about a war is a great deal more than the narrow legal sense that you 're talking about . </s>
Well , it can be , but you need an actionable proposition . I mean , you need something you actually can decide on . And when it 's so subjective that you 're talking about a mindset , it 's like - - General Hayden and I showed up in the same government for three years or so . </s>
We did n't come to work with an identical mindset . We came with slightly different mindsets , and he -- at the time -- was an active military officer . I think it had a different meaning to me then as a civilian in the White House . So , it 's a very subjective thing . </s>
One of the things about this war -- which is different from , certainly , World War II or Vietnam -- is that the national security apparatus -- and actually a subset of it , feels like it 's at war . </s>
Still to this day . But the people do n't . And that 's ahistoric . So , it has n't usually been that way for us . And I actually think that 's okay in this particular case for -- not everyone to feel like they 're walking around , feeling like they 're mobilized for war -- but for a subset of the national security apparatus to actually act that way . </s>
So he 's saying your definition of war is too subjective . He is saying that . </s>
Yeah . I think that 's a weird way to put the War on Terror , only because what followed from calling it a War on Terror -- which was not my language . I mean , that was the language of an administration that determined that after 9/11 , we would conceive of it at as war . And it would have all sorts of implications -- not just legal implications , but implications for a whole range of activities , because we were going to call it a war . And all the -- so , it was n't just a feeling . </s>
It was a series of procedures and policies that flowed from that . So let me just give you an example , because that may help -- what this legal debate means . </s>
So by deciding that it 's a War on Terror . So , that 's what it is . This is the debate about military commissions . What do we mean by military commissions ? </s>
Well , if it 's a War on Terror , that is this thing that we can define and determine where we want to go with detainees or how we want to try or not try them . </s>
Then , we create a whole new military commission system that , under the previous administration , got essentially overturned by the Supreme Court . And then you have to come back , right ? And then you have to say , “What are we going to do with these detainees ? ” </s>
Because it 's a problem . We all agree it 's a problem . </s>
And then you come back , and you work with Congress , and you create a military commission -- which this president did -- which provides very strong protections for the people within the military commission system , has independent appellate review -- and let 's just be clear , has been supported by every Article III court , every federal court in the United States . We 're not at a constitutional crisis every day . We 're just not there . So , it was n't our language . It was the language of the AUMF -- authorization for the use of military force against Al-Qaeda and its affiliates . </s>
Was n't our language . So to say now , that we 're calling it a feeling seems like it 's just a little bit of amnesia there , I think . Mike Hayden . Yeah . I 'm confused . </s>
Are we a nation at war or not , is the question I would ask . And do our armed forces have the right -- does the president have the right to use the tools of a nation in conflict , to protect you against Al-Qaeda ? We 've got some commentary here about some things that were done over the last 10 years . And there 's some criticisms -- or implied criticisms -- that some of these were overreactions , or not in the best traditions , or novel developments in American constitutional military law . I 'm not here to debate that . </s>
I am here to suggest that we are not at our best when we are fearful . </s>
And that the degree that we are not fearful , we adhere to the best of our traditions . </s>
Lincoln 's quote about the better angels of our nature . We are able to do that more freely now . </s>
We are able to consult those better angels , because the threat is incredibly much reduced . </s>
And it 's much reduced because those people who did those things are largely dead . And they 're dead because we were a nation at war , and we 're allowed to use the tools of a nation at war , to make them dead . I do n't think it 's time to give up that capacity -- to give up that authority -- </s>
Why , Michael , if they 're mostly dead ? Because , Peter mentioned -- Peter mentioned -- -- because they are n't all dead . And Peter mentioned John Brennan , and Leon Panetta , and David Petraeus giving rather rosy descriptions of Al-Qaeda . I mean , rosy from our point of view . They were talking about Al-Qaeda maimed . </s>
They were talking about Al-Qaeda in Pakistan , and in the tribal region . </s>
They were not talking about the franchises in Yemen , or in Somalia , or in Islamic Maghreb . And none of them have suggested this is over . All of them , in fact , have called for at least the current tempo of operations . </s>
I have met no one who is actually responsible for creating the circumstances that make this debate possible -- should we end this thing ? </s>
No one who is responsible for creating that , who actually thinks we ought to stop doing what we 're doing . Peter Bergen . </s>
Well , I 'm glad that General Hayden has conceded that , certainly , our principal enemies are dead . </s>
I mean , that 's usually how you end a war , when your enemies are mostly dead . </s>
We did n't kill every Nazi at the end of World War II . I mean , there 's a certain point . What we 're claiming here is it 's time to end the War on Terror as the organizing principle of our national security policy , which by the way , cost us trillions of dollars over the past decade -- which has allowed us to ignore a lot of serious problems we have at home and other threats abroad . </s>
You know , there are a million Americans now with top secret clearances . I do n't think they all needed them . That is one of the legacies of defining it as a War on Terror . </s>
And Richard said that we 're not debating the War on Terror as it was produced by President George Bush in the first four years . Well , I mean , let 's try and take that back to our side a little bit . The War on Terror was not the war on Al-Qaeda and its allies . </s>
It was an open-ended conflict against a tactic that produced a lot of enormous problems for this country , including the Iraq War and all that , the legacy we have from that . And so , there is sort of historical part to this . It 's important . We 're not just debating about what happened today . </s>
It 's about a mindset which causes countries some serious economic problems -- which we are still trying to recover from . </s>
As I said -- Richard Falkenrath . -- maybe these debates often turn on trying to get the voters to think about the proposition in a particular way . And the -- </s>
But so are you doing it . </s>
Yeah , that 's why it 's called a debate . But I think I read the proposition a little more closely , because you could have written it like this . It could have said , “Should the War on Terror be the central organizing principle of U.S. foreign policy ? ” You could have said that . I think we would have been uncomfortable on this side of the table . </s>
But what do you think the audience is -- let me ask . Do you assume the audience sees it your way or do you think the audience -- Well , I suggested a way to think about it . And as a -- Okay . </s>
Right . -- to make it sort of actionable . </s>
Because as we 've said , we are currently at war , in a legal sense , and we 'd like to frame this proposition , saying , “Should we no longer be ? ” Right . That 's really what it means , “It 's time to end the War on Terror.” Now , we could make this a referendum on how this was handled between September 11 , 2001 and then the elections of 2006 . </s>
Or , you know , you could do that too . </s>
That 's a different argument . </s>
And , you know , we 're prepared to have that , but it 's really not the war that we face right now today . </s>
And many of these issues were considered -- this is ironic -- by the Obama Administration . </s>
Many of the sort of tactical issues . And as I said , he did n't divert anything from what Bush was doing . In fact he intensified it -- the unilateral use of military force against a neutral country -- Pakistan -- into their territory . </s>
It -- So . -- increased . So -- make your point , but then I want to come back to the questions . </s>
A couple things on what Rich says . </s>
This argument is actually -- if you read it -- is about the War on Terror . And it 's not a referendum on the first four years of the Bush Administration , or the first six years , or even the first two of Obama . </s>
It is about , what did we mean by the War on Terror ? What was that definition that was used for so many years ? </s>
And are we ready to be over ? And they are doing -- they are trying to convince you , sort of a simplistic notion here , which is -- for those of us who have also served in government and national security is way too simplistic , simply because you want to say that the War on Terror is over does not mean that you 're saying , “No military action ever.” Right ? It does n't mean , “Oh , gosh , I wish Bin Laden had been brought to a courtroom in New York City.” No one is saying that . </s>
There is authority for the President to use force , including killing Bin Laden , under the Authorization for the Use of Military Force . I support that . So what stops , if you declare the War on Terror over , what stops happening ? Well , I think it 's already over . So let me then -- that 's a great question . </s>
Because what also happened over the course of this 10 year period is that a narrative is being rewritten . And the narrative is that Obama is exactly the same as Bush . </s>
But Bush was n't exactly the same as Bush . </s>
We have grown . And there are examples everywhere -- coercive interrogation , the black site -- all of that , we have learned . They learned , we learned . And that ability to change does n't mean that , you know , “Oh , ” you know , “We 're going to continue to call it the same thing.” </s>
That war ended . That notion that military or this War on Terror was how we were going to approach it . </s>
It became much better . And can we talk about Homeland Security for a minute ? But if it 's ended , then why are you saying it 's now time to end the war ? </s>
Because they 're never going to end it . Well -- </s>
Right ? The 10th anniversary is a good sign to begin to say , “Let 's give , ” -- have the American public say , “We 're ready to not think of our world this way.” That the War on -- So , maybe we should let Juliette and Peter argue this one out -- -- because they were not arguing the same proposition here . I mean , this is entirely different . </s>
Juliette says the War on Terror as we -- as she 's defining it -- is already over . </s>
And Peter says , “Time to end it now , because we decimated most of the Al-Qaeda leadership and the ideology was defeated” -- Completely -- -- “In the Arab Spring.” These are totally different propositions . So we 're not clear -- </s>
They are two factual arguments to make the case . Peter Bergen . Right . Which is fair -- which is a fair way to do it . </s>
But I think we hear your point . Michael Hayden . I return to my point , that I 'm the one on stage that got the phone call in the middle of the night . </s>
I knew what the war was about , right ? It 's about what he said . It was about the authorization for the use of military force , and the ability to use combat power against Al-Qaeda and affiliated organizations . </s>
There was no confusion on my part . And so , I do n't quite understand . If that 's still okay , what is it we 're departing from ? </s>
Well -- Peter Bergen </s>
-- as sort of another way to look at this is that President Clinton tried to kill Bin Laden in 1998 , with cruise missile strikes . </s>
This is not new , the idea that we reserve to ourselves the ability to kill enemies of the state . Well , we 're just calling for an end of this all-encompassing , global conflict that has cost us so much money . </s>
We 're not calling for a global police action against terrorists , certainly . We reserve the right for a certain kind of war-like activities , but it 's time to stop this sort of grandiose approach , where we 're at war with any person who 's ever said the word “Jihad” around the world , which is going to cost us a lot of money . Peter , that 's a cartoon . </s>
That 's -- no one said that anymore . This is not the case . I mean , you can lambast the other side of this debate by constructing the straw man , but that 's just not it . I mean , we 're not -- </s>
Well , is it ? Is it , Peter ? Do you feel that that 's still the rhetoric coming from the U.S. ? Well , I think when we say , “The War on Terror , ” when FDR went to war against the Nazis , he did n't declare war against the sort of tactic of U-Boats or kamikaze pilots , in the case of Japan . </s>
I mean , the War on Terror was a very expansive notion that pulled us into the conflicts in the Iraq -- that we now orphaned -- and others . And that 's what we 're saying – it is the end of that . I mean , Juliette is making a point that it 's , in a sense , already ended . But also , our enemies are essentially defeated . </s>
And defeat does n't mean total obliteration . It means that we can now move on and say , essentially , that the longest war in American history , which it is now , the longest war in American history . You know , there 's a time -- a time to move on . </s>
All right . </s>
I 'd like to go to some questions from the audience . And the way we 'll do this . I can see you , and we 'll -- I think I explained beforehand . I believe everybody was here . </s>
If you raise your hand , a microphone will be brought to you . We 'd ask you to rise , to be terse , to make it a question , to keep it on point , and to keep the microphone about four inches away from your mouth . And this gentleman in the very center , if you -- I 'm looking right at you -- and if you 'd stand up , they 'll bring a mic over to you . </s>
My question is -- I just want to get the mic over to you , so we can hear you on the radio broadcast . My question is to Peter and Juliette . I think the other side has defined very well what they think would be lost if the war on terror , as they define it , would be ended . Can you explain very clearly what would be gained if the war on terror , as you define it , would be ended . </s>
Thank you . Could you just say that last part again ? If the war – What would be gained by ending the war on terror , as you define it ? Honesty , descriptiveness , actually reflecting what 's happening out there . </s>
I mean , whether the war on terror ended as we started to change , it 's just a learning process over 10 years , to effective counterterrorism -- effective counterterrorism tools . That happened over the course of a 10 year period . </s>
So the reason why not to call it a war on terror is because we know what the war on terror meant . Now , they can now claim it was just a legal device . But I lived that time . We all lived that time . We all served in government . </s>
Three of us served in government during that time . So I 've just asked people to remember , as we have been discussing , what that meant . It 's not an indictment on everything that happened or the changes or whatever else . </s>
It is just simply today we have effective counterterrorism measures . Some of them might be military , might be the use of military force as authorized by law . Many of them will not be . And it 's as simple as that . And so we can say that we did n't mean by the `` War on Terror '' anything but there 's this law . </s>
And that 's just for you all to decide if that 's what you thought it meant at that time . Can I ask you , sir , to , first of all , if you do n't mind identifying yourself . And then in terms of the answer , do you feel that your question was answered , that it was addressed ? My name 's Philip Gourevitch . I 'm a writer . </s>
I was asking whether you think -- the issues that you 're describing are a kind of broad conception of the war on terror . And they 're defining it as a legal set of tool -- a toolbox . And you 're essentially saying that you agree with them that that legal toolbox should not be abandoned . </s>
So I 'm saying , what would you -- Could you -- I 'm sorry . </s>
One more time . Could you stand ? You do n't have to repeat the question because you were about to repeat it anyway . Okay . </s>
But go at it . You 're saying that that tool -- are you saying -- you 're saying that toolbox should n't be abandoned either . Right . But the concept of the war on terror should be because of a bunch of things that you say have essentially -- Been changed . </s>
-- not been practiced for a while so -- Right . </s>
-- it seems like you think it should be redefined . And , but -- and there 's a reason for -- And I 'm asking what would be gained by saying `` The war on terror is over , '' and would n't -- if you 're still preserving all those legal tools -- Right . </s>
-- that you think that they -- that they said that we should . Not all of them , yeah . No . </s>
I think in answering in terms , I think more descriptive of actually what we 're doing , more limited description of what counterterrorism efforts and procedures actually are . There 's a difference between counterterrorism efforts and actions and war . And it 's – I think the question might also -- </s>
-- be descriptive in that sense . -- might also be reframed as what 's the harm to -- in continuing to call it a war on terror ? Well , then that 's my -- I viewed the war on terror as so expansive and defining so many authorities , including a commander in chief by all -- any means necessary to protect us . That explains a 10-year or eight-year trajectory . I 'm not going back to say , oh , look how horrible they are . </s>
I 'm going back to say , that 's what the war on terror was . Are n't we glad that we have moved away from that ? They moved away from it . </s>
We moved away from it . I just want to see if your opponents would like to respond . Michael Hayden . I talked about one dimension of expansiveness . </s>
You know , war on terror , whatever the rhetoric was , it was war on al-Qaeda and its affiliates . I 'm sorry to repeat myself . I did not have the authority to do against Hezbollah and other terrorist organizations who are unaffiliated with al- Qaeda and not responsible for the attack of 9/11 , the authorities I had to deal with this well , clearly defined enemy . So the expansiveness in that dimension was n't expansive . In addition , the expansiveness in this direction , what is it you could do against this enemy force , was controlled by U.S. law , by the Constitution . </s>
But was not the invasion of Iraq , which had its own authorization , also part of the war on terror as they 're describing it ? I -- you know , we can talk a lot about different and specific things . But -- no , no . But no , no . But Mike , it -- I 'm not debating the merits of the war on Iraq at all or asking you to . </s>
Yeah . Or I 'm not debating with you because I 'm the moderator . I 'm just trying to deliver what I heard as her point to you , which is that there is an expansiveness to the term that leads to an expansiveness of actions . The -- okay . </s>
So the attack on 9/11 created an environment in which the -- it was more likely that our government would make a decision to go to war with Iraq , I think that 's clear . Okay ? The war in Iraq was not tied to the authorization for the use of military force . </s>
And people like me in the American intelligence community , made it very clear that there were not operational connections between the Iraqi intelligence service and al-Qaeda , the named enemy in the AUMF . John , I mean , is it -- to your direct question , the answer is President Bush and his principal officers in explaining the rationale for going to war against Iraq did reference the war on terror extensively and repeatedly . And they were by no means unique in doing so . That occurred on both sides of the political aisle and may still go on today . Now , whether that was an appropriate characterizations or not , who knows ? </s>
But , I mean , they did . Well , I think we do know . Is this a debate about ending the war on Iraq or ending the war on terror ? Well , they were related to each other , I mean , that 's -- the way -- the way the war was sold is that it was part of the war on terror . That was the intellectual architecture of the war . </s>
Again , Peter , those are events of a half a decade ago or longer . Well , we 're still in Iraq . Well , yeah , we are . And frankly , I mean , we all have to deal with life as it is , not as we wish it would have been . </s>
And so we 're not -- Oh . </s>
And so we 're not -- oh , `` awe . '' Come on . There are -- people who are actually responsible for things have to deal with the world as it is , not as they wish it to be . And that may be the actual core of the debate . </s>
All right . I 'd like to go to another question . </s>
You know , I 'm -- I 'm -- Can I just -- People often ask me , `` Why do n't you call on more women ? '' </s>
Because women are n't raising their hands . So I 'd like to get -- oh , there you are . Do you mind giving us your name too ? Thanks . </s>
Thank you , yes . </s>
My name is Eileen Karovoch , and I think I relate to the first gentleman 's question . I do n't understand the economic benefits of ending the war on terrorism . You talked about the trillions of dollars that we 're spending . </s>
And I am tired of this recession . How will ending the war on terrorism give money back ? Well , I mean , it 's a factual matter that we spent -- Peter Bergen . </s>
-- a trillion dollars at least in Iraq , right ? I mean , we 're -- by winding down there and no longer part of the war on terror there , we 're going to save ourselves a lot of money . As a factual matter , we spent half a trillion dollars on our intelligence . </s>
I think Juliette would have a better answer on how much we spend on our Homeland Security . We spend a huge amount of money on this , and we ca n't afford it right now . And clearly there is some belt tightening that is needed , and if we stopped having this construct on the war on terror it would help making the hard decisions that we need to make about reducing the size of our bloated – I mentioned the fact that there are a million Americans with top-secret clearances . That’s not secret . </s>
Top secret . I don’t think that all these people really need these top secret clearances . We are facing a group of people that on a good day may now number 300 or 400 . But it was a recession question on that . I’m not sure how the clearance issue relates to that . </s>
Well , are going to have to reduce the number of people in our Intelligence apparatus . We are going to have to reduce the number of people , if we are going to draw down in Afghanistan and Iraq , and by saying that the War on Terror is over , that’s going to help those decisions . We asked—Slate asked its readers to submit questions to us . Slate selected a few for us and I’d like to bring one of them up because I think it goes to this side and to some degree , Richard , you had touched on this but it’s more specific . His name is Peter McKay and he’s actually from New York City . </s>
“Since you believe that it is not yet time to end the War on Terror , could you please explain what specific conditions you would have to see met to know that that time has come . No </s>
Okay , fair question . Michael Hayden ? </s>
I’m kind of with Rich . This will be something that we’ll recognize when we see it , like Supreme Court justice described something else . All I can do is repeat what I said earlier . Everybody I know who’s actually responsible for getting us to the state we are in now , which is far better than we were one five or ten years ago – no one thinks it’s time to stop . </s>
No one thinks that we’ve gotten to the point for al-Qaeda is sufficiently non-resilient that it can not regenerate . Until we 've reached that point and make that judgment , no , I do n't think we should end what Rich and I are arguing we should continue , which is a legal authority to use all the tools at the disposal of the American government . Richard , why is it difficult to foresee what those conditions would be ? </s>
Well , it 's just something that I would n't want to write down on paper or articulate until you have to . And so I 'm quite comfortable with the proposition tonight that now is not the time to do it . Do I want to rule out that some future time , if we have a new government in Pakistan , fundamentally change the environment in the horn of Africa and the Arabian Peninsula , might there be the conditions then ? </s>
Maybe . But there 's nothing pushing it . </s>
There 's no -- as a -- one of the first questions that came from the audience was , what 's the harm ? I 'm not seeing any harm . Any benefits that were gained by ending the war on terror as particularly Juliette defines it , were already gained when President Obama got elected and won the Nobel Prize principally for not being Bush and -- -- and , you know , this is -- the benefits have already accrued . Only harm comes from changing the legal apparatus that allows us to continue offensive military operations . </s>
I just do n't know -- Juliette Kayyem . </s>
I just do n't know how -- I mean , first of all , with all due respect , General Hayden , I think no one is arguing that al-Qaeda -- no one in authority or who has to deal with dealing with the security apparatus or figuring out how to distribute funds that are drying up , because that 's what you know in particular Homeland Security , that 's what state and locals are dealing with , that 's what police departments are dealing with , how do I prioritize the threat out there when everyone wants to be safe not just from terrorism but from crime and whatever else may go on . </s>
So no one is arguing that we 're closing the door to acknowledgement of a threat of terror , and it 's just not the debate . And so they 're sort of throwing up a bunch of straw men against this typical notion of people who want the American public to acknowledge , and maybe it happened two years ago with the election of Obama -- growing recognition that war and what war meant was not the way to describe what we were doing . </s>
And General Hayden talks about this consensus that we want all the tools in the toolbox , but to remind you -- the consensus was not a consensus because the President decided it was a consensus . It took Congress , the courts , the public , leaders within the Bush administration , and , yes , a new president , to realize that this construct that we had created over the course of six , eight , or 10 years needed to be thought about in a different way . And that 's what we 're asking of you , not saying , throw in the towel , let bin Laden , hang out with his wives , that is not what we 're saying and it 's a disservice to people who want to challenge this notion of the war on terror to caricature us that way . Okay , I want to go back to another question . </s>
Sir , I 'm looking at you , and you stand up because you seem to be -- just wait for the mike and if you could tell us who you are . I’m Matt Foley . I 'm just wondering in 1993 the Trade Center was bombed first time , and they went a different route , they did n't start a war on terror , they prosecuted the people responsible . Could you guys just give me an idea of what the cost of this war on terror has been -- dollars , we know that there 's been thousands of lives , but in comparison to what was done in '93 , why is this approach better than that one because it seems to me that they were able to apprehend the people responsible much more quickly and with far less human cost -- </s>
So your question is to the side against the motion . Yes . </s>
Mike Hayden . In its starkest form , the law enforcement approach after the first attack on the World Trade Center in '93 did not prevent the destruction of the World Trade Centers in 2001 . </s>
The `` We are a nation at war approach '' following 2001 has prevented any similar attack on the United States in the ensuing 10 years . </s>
I think that 's the biggest distinction . Let me just say that -- Two years or three years , from '93 to 2000 there was no attacks . </s>
Right . So what you 're saying is that this war -- because we do n't know when the next -- hopefully there wo n't be any more attacks but right now the evidence is -- There actually were . They were n't against the continental United States but they were against U.S. interests abroad , and if I could just say , I 'll tell you , one of the rhetorical excesses of the first Bush administration and so you know 2001 to 2004 in which I served which troubled me was a -- they did tend to dismiss the law enforcement approach as they were talking about the various military options . There 's no question that there was a somewhat disdainful view of the law enforcement . </s>
As someone who then left the White House and went and worked in law enforcement , I no longer do , that troubled me because it strikes me as it 's a completely legitimate set of options available to the executive branch and deserves no -- it should not be treated disdainfully at all . There were successful prosecutions in that time period . Ramzi Yousef is currently serving a life sentence in super max . He was one of the architects of it , the nephew of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , one of the architects of 9/11 . </s>
But there were many other aspects of that investigation that were enormously problematic , principally concerning the compartmentalization of information and the inability to allow the information generated in the law enforcement investigation to sort of transmute across the inner agency and inform a wider intelligence perspective of a growing threat . Now , a few people saw it , but the system as a whole struggled to grasp it . Juliette Kayyem . I would actually totally agree with Rich on this point . </s>
I think that the changes that were made over the course of the 10 years , not because we had to call it a war but these are actually statutory changes made to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act have brought about tremendous changes within both the law enforcement intelligence community , local law enforcement and whatever else . So I actually would agree with -- I think we’re all sort of -- there are a variety of tools that can be used by any present executive branch member or whatever else to counter al-Qaeda and to defeat al-Qaeda . Sorry I’m going move on just because I think that actually both have answered your question . </s>
You might not like the answer , but they’ve addressed it . Right -- yeah . If you can stand , sir ? Warren Ilchman . </s>
I’ve heard al-Qaeda and its affiliates , and I’ve heard Hezbollah mentioned , but no one has mentioned in the whole evening the Taliban . Must the Taliban be defeated before the War on Terror is completed ? </s>
Which side would you like to put that question to first ? Okay , let’s put it to Peter Bergen . I think the Taliban has to be made irrelevant , and the Taliban to a large degree is becoming less relevant in Afghanistan over time . I think what we’re looking at , if we pull out for a little bit -- there are still Marxist-Leninists somewhere in the United States on some college campus somewhere . </s>
Just no one pays any attention to them . And you know , we’re at the point where al-Qaeda and its ideas and we’ve included that in the Taliban , which , by the way , enjoys only a seven percent favorable rating in Afghanistan right now . </s>
There’s nothing like living under the Taliban as a prophylactic to their ideas about creating a utopia here on earth , don’t make sense . So these ideas are becoming irrelevant , and that’s why the War on Terror should be ended . </s>
We’ve just heard from Rich that he won’t even tell us when the war will end . Well , if it doesn’t end with the founder and leader of al-Qaeda , the intellectual author of 9/11 , which is the reason we went to war in Afghanistan in the first place , the fact the Taliban wouldn’t hand him over -- if it doesn’t end when it’s totally irrelevant in the Middle East , if it doesn’t end when it’s the war of ideas in the Muslim World , if it doesn’t end when its entire top leadership is decimated , I mean , when does it end ? </s>
Richard Falkenrath , is the Taliban irrelevant ? No , it’s not . </s>
I mean , it’s not irrelevant . It certainly matters a lot in the reconstruction of Afghanistan and the geopolitics of that region . There’s no question that they supported 9/11 , the Taliban organization . They supported al-Qaeda prior to 9/11 . </s>
Now , it looks like that was a very expensive thing for them to do , and there are other groups in this area -- Peter is actually far more expert on this than I am -- that are still supporting the remnants of al-Qaeda central such as it were . So that’s a long-winded way of saying they are not essential to some sort of winning the War on Terror , prevailing them , but there’s no question that because of their historical legacy , they are legitimate targets for the U.S. military in what we are calling here the War on Terror as it operates in Afghanistan and Pakistan . </s>
I’d like to blend both Peter and Richard’s point . The destruction of them may not be required in the same way that you want to destroy al-Qaeda core . Peter’s comment about destroying their relevance , I think , is the actual objective there . </s>
Ma’am ? Yeah . If you can rise and the mic will come to you . Hi . </s>
Often a war is constituted with troop levels . So I would like to know each side’s perspective on troop levels in ending the war or continuing the war . </s>
Troop levels where ? </s>
I’m not sure -- well , can you try another crack at that ? Do you believe that troops should be brought out of Afghanistan to -- where the war is being conducted ? </s>
Or should we continue to have troops and for how long ? My last appearance at this debate forum was arguing that the war in Afghanistan was something to continue , with Max Boot . He is also here in the audience . I think it would be difficult for me to now change my mind and in such a public fashion . And I think that we , you know , we -- there are things that we , you know , making sure that Afghanistan doesn’t revert into a haven for the Taliban and a lot of groups is , you know , that is a very good thing . </s>
You know , it was the War on Terror kind of construct that got into a war which cost us a lot more in blood and treasure where we were not attacked from , which , of course , was Iraq . </s>
Michael Hayden . I agree very strongly with what Peter said . And I would suggest to you that the size of the American footprint there over time matters . </s>
I mean , it does have an effect . But far more important is the persistence of the American footprint . We left that region before , and we suffered for it greatly on 9/11 . And so I think Peter and I are in strong agreement that some substantial American presence there , as difficult as that is for us for a variety of reasons , keeps us so much safer that it 's probably worth those sacrifices . But is that presence of -- is that -- does that constitute war , Peter ? </s>
Well , as Juliette said and I 've said , I mean , we 're not opposed to conducting continuing our presence in Afghanistan and making sure that it does n't revert into a safe haven - - But we 're talking about what we call it . So would you call it -- war -- Well , it 's a war against al-Qaeda and its allies . The president , President Obama , correctly redefined downwards this open-ended global conflict against the tactic and named the enemy . </s>
And that 's the enemy that we continue to fight . Okay . Right in the center . The people on this side define ending the war on terror as repealing the legal instrument that authorized military force . </s>
I do n't understand , on this side , exactly what it is that you do , what you define the ending of the end of the war on terror . Is it declaring victory and going home ? Because President Bush did that on the aircraft carrier . How 'd that go ? Did n't go so well . </s>
I just do n't understand exactly what it is that you think -- should President Obama give a speech and -- We 're not -- we 're not -- </s>
-- declare victory ? </s>
Well , so here 's -- Juliette Kayyem . </s>
-- what 's so interesting about this . We 're not asking for a -- this war is over . I mean , if anything , I hope that the description of the last year showed this may be a bit too late , not to criticize Intelligence Squared , that I actually think without you knowing it , we did end the war on terror and that in trying to expose how we ended it , it 's -- and what the reason for discussing it in such an open manner is because how we talk about counterterrorism measures , whether it 's killing Bin Laden or it 's bringing someone to an article 3 court , or it 's working with Arab and Muslim communities so that they will feel comfortable with the NYPD and tell them when there might be extremists amongst their midst , certainly the NYPD has been great at . </s>
But we 're -- so that is an acknowledgment of the reality of where we are , because it affects how we perceive ourselves . It clearly affects how everyone else perceives us in the outside world . And the war on terror is not a benign statement . We 've been sitting here hearing , oh , yes , we may have gone too far , and maybe this war -- it was n't benign . And so maybe part of our obligation 10 years later is to admit it 's not a benign term . </s>
Richard Falkenrath . I think the question underscores one of the difficulties in Juliette and Peter 's position on here . And if I can just sharpen it and pose it also as a question . </s>
Since we 've agreed -- or at least I think that Juliette concedes we should n't change the legal framework that currently governs counterterrorism operations by U.S. forces abroad . </s>
You could talk about it rhetorically differently . And in fact , President Obama could have his aircraft carrier moment right now wherever he wanted , to go out and announce that he is announcing the end of the war on terror . Okay , now , question , you used to work for him in the cabinet department , could go back and work for him . Would you recommend he do that ? </s>
Why would I not recommend that ? I 'm asking , you would ? He would never do it , first of all , no -- And because the politics -- </s>
You 'd be fired . Let me tell you why he would n't , because it took me nine months to move 19 Massachusetts National Guard members from the Pilgrim facility , because the war on terror is not benign , because this notion of the war on terror , it has completely limited our politicians ' capacity to move . And I think the amazing thing about this president is how much he has moved us . But this gets to the question that came up earlier . Right ? </s>
So if I think it would be bad political advice , and he should fire me if I told -- in the same way , you know , if I told him to say the war on terror is over , not because I think it 's inaccurate but because I actually think that politically we -- that the public and the way we talk about it gives no opportunity for the kinds of changes , the little changes I had to make or the big changes that have been made . </s>
All right , Richard come in on this -- I think this circles back to an earlier question , which is what gain would come from accepting your side of this argument . And what would happen is President Obama and his advisors would say , look I’ve already realized all the gains . </s>
We’ve talked about it differently , I’ve won the Nobel Peace Prize , I don’t need to do this . It’s already done . So you agree that it’s over . No Isn’t that what you’re saying ? </s>
You are admitting -- you are also admitting that it would be political suicide for anyone to say it . And all I’m saying is , maybe we can create a space where that’s not true . </s>
Where we can move 19 Massachusetts National Guard Members , or we can create more stringent military commissions , or we can close the black sites or whatever it is that we need to do , and that’s actually a good thing because it means we’ve changed over 10 years . Sir . My name is Josh Steps I’m from Sydney , Australia . In an attempt to bridge this definition or gap about the War on Terror . My question for Richard . </s>
Don’t you feel that over the long arch of history that maybe that the greatest inhibition of people’s freedom is governments and not so much terrorism and outside threats , and do you fear that maybe an open-ended war that goes forever that you’re not even able to say when it could possibly end , is more of a liability , even if it gives us more of a tool , more tools in the arsenal in the short term , that maybe the long-term liability outweighs that , and how do you feel about – Interesting question . It’s a great question , in fact it’s several questions marbled together . And one is that there’s no question that over the arch of history that governments have done more harm to human beings than any terrorist organization . </s>
Governments are capable of enormous destruction , there’s no question about that . </s>
And I don’t think that al-Qaeda or any terrorist group is 10 feet tall . </s>
I do n't go to sleep afraid . I never did . And they are what I think is ultimately a manageable problem . In this -- there 's always the potential for government excess . </s>
Government in our country domestically has a monopoly on the use of force and is authorized in certain circumstances to invade your liberty and your privacy in all sorts of ways . And one of the great debates in this country and in any country is how do you set those rules and what are they ? And it 's not set in stone . </s>
It evolves , changes over time . In fact , the last 10 years since 9/11 have illustrated that , and it has evolved greatly . </s>
And I think Juliette pointed this out that there have been , in every single functional area , it has evolved . But here I want to come back to what my colleague , Mike , said , there really is , today , a consensus on this . There really is . </s>
It 's remarkable . </s>
On electronic surveillance , there is a consensus . </s>
There was not in 2005 when James Risen published the details of a certain classified program . Today , there is . FISA modernization act was passed , broad bipartisan support . </s>
Obama is all for it . Bush was for it , no problem . </s>
On detention , right , there is actually consensus on what happens now from where it was with Bush to today . On tribunals , also consensus . </s>
President Obama has expressly endorsed the military tribunal process signed into law by President Bush , enacted by the previous Congress . </s>
So a long-winded way of saying , to your question , yes , there are risks that we must constantly be vigilant for them . But there is broad consensus right now on where those lines should be drawn across the political elite in Washington . </s>
This narrative of consensus was not a consensus -- </s>
Juliette Kayyem . -- necessarily of choice , right ? I mean , let 's not forget -- it 's not like all these like really smart people sat in a room and go , okay , well maybe we 're excessive then , but now we 're going to be all Kumbaya and figure out how to do this right . It was a consensus because the Bush administration lost a lot in court , because Congress required them to make changes and that lasted into the Obama administration . </s>
Because their own national security experts , including interrogators , people in the military justice system , lawyers in the Department of Justice who did n't like the secret surveillance were rebelling . This was not -- so I 'm glad that there 's a consensus , but it 's just -- I challenge this notion that -- ask you to remember that this sort of came about because , in all actuality , every smart person thinks the same . Michael Hayden . So it 's very , very difficult decisions . Michael Hayden . </s>
It 's a very great question that you raised , maybe let me give you a different perspective on what they do to states and what they do to their citizens . We have certain authorities , all right , that the states exercise that for reasons of discomfort or political risk or what else ? </s>
A government decides not to exercise the full extent of their authorities . And because of doing that , very bad things happen to their citizens because they did not do all that they could do . If they did not do all that the law allowed , then for political reasons , they played back from the line . I used to describe this to our work force as to why we had to be as aggressive as we possibly could be within the law , because my view is this sort of box I 'm creating for you is the field in which we 're allowed to play . If we play back from those lines , and we fail , and bad things happen to you -- of a catastrophic nature that -- like happened ten years ago , that box I drew here , you 're going to draw a different box . </s>
You are . And the box is going to be this way . So in another way , the way we security professionals , the intelligence community view this is we have to be very aggressive within the law doing our job because if we fail the natural tendency of a country like ours or a country like Australia would be to do things probably destructive to the long term liberties out of fear . And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . </s>
So here 's where we are . We are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn . They will be two minutes each , and remember , you members of the audience , you voted before the debate , we 're going to ask you to vote once again afterwards , this is their last chance to change your mind . I 'd also , with your indulgence , like to just record one more item for the radio broadcast , to allow them to take a break in the middle of the section that just happened , and it would be wonderful if I could ask you to applaud . </s>
I 'll say my line and then we can move forward , okay ? So if you could just applaud , that would be terrific , thank you . </s>
Welcome back to this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . We 're in the question and answer section . </s>
I 'm John Donvan , your moderator . We have four debaters , two teams of two , debating this motion , `` It Is Time to End the War on Terror . '' That 's it . Thank you . </s>
All right . So now on to round three . These are closing statements . They will be two minutes each . Each debater is speaking in turn . </s>
And our motion is , `` It Is Time to End the War on Terror , '' and speaking first against the motion , Michael Hayden , former Director of the National Security Agency and the CIA . </s>
Thanks , John . </s>
Our , Rich’s purpose and mind here tonight was not to defend all aspects of what our government has done over the last 10 years . </s>
There have been a lot of thoughts put out about some things that some people find offensive or uncomfortable about what we 've done . I actually think a lot of those points are debatable , but that 's not tonight 's debate . What we 're looking at is , broadly speaking , how should we conceive ourselves in order to insure our own national security . </s>
And I mean no disrespect but I 'm trying to follow in detail what it is we 're arguing against from the other side . And I think it 's not an unfair characterization continue what we 're doing , that we have a desperate plea to repackage the atmospherics around which that which we are doing . </s>
And I 'm trying to parse out the arguments for just repackaging . And from Peter I think I 'm getting the argument that you 've been successful , back off , you 've won the thing . And from Juliette I 'm getting the argument , you should n't have been doing all those things that you were doing that Peter said were successful because it enabled you to win those things . This is an important matter . That one percent of the republic that 's defending the other 99 percent needs to know you 're with them and that you 're behind them . </s>
And I mentioned in my earlier comments about not being too celebratory , and Peter 's right , massive events in the last six months , the Arab Spring and the killing of bin Laden . </s>
If one were to write a history of the American Civil War , one could determine I think looking backward that the decisive events took place in the first three days of July in 1863 with the fall of Vicksburg and the defeat of Pickett 's Charge going up Cemetery Hill . I think historians would agree , it was decisive , but there was 21 months of war left after that . </s>
And spiking the football and calling it a win and walking away from the battlefield in July of 1863 would have put at risk all that we now know have been achieved by that point . Thank you , Michael Hayden . </s>
Our motion is , `` It Is Time to End the War on Terror , '' and to speak for the motion , Peter Bergen , a CNN National Security Analyst and Director of National Security Studies at the New America Foundation . </s>
We’ve heard from Rich tonight that al-Qaeda is n't 10 feet tall and also it 's a manageable problem but also that we should be at war against this terrorism tactic until the 22nd century , and that there 's no circumstances that he can define tonight when we should declare the end of this war . And as we were thinking about this question , we turned to two of the leading experts on terrorism in the world for some counsel , one of them said , we here in the United States certainly are much safer . Al-Qaeda still exists but it 's been massively damaged . Through nine years of an onslaught against them , our defensive abilities here in the country , our intelligence , our law enforcement , our Homeland Security is much better , so there 's no question the United States is safer . </s>
The second leading expert said just a few weeks ago , future attacks are going to be more numerous but less complex , less well organized , less well likely to succeed , and less lethal if they do succeed . I think the killing of bin Laden will accelerate that change . The first expert was Richard Falkenrath speaking to CNN almost exactly a year ago . And the second expert was General Hayden speaking to the Associated Press this summer after the death of bin Laden . We agree with both these gentlemen that al-Qaeda has been massively damaged and that there’s no question that we’re safer and that this much weakened al-Qaeda is far less likely to succeed with even small-bore attacks it will try and pull off in the future and that this process of al-Qaeda decline has been accelerated with the death of their leader . </s>
And for these reasons , and because we agree with these gentlemen , and others we’ve outlined this evening , we urge you to vote for the motion that `` It 's time to end the War on Terror.” Thank you , Peter Bergen . Our motion is `` It 's time to end the War on Terror.” And here to speak against the motion , Richard Falkenrath , who is former deputy commissioner for counterterrorism at the NYPD and deputy Homeland Security advisor . </s>
Thank you very much . It’s a real pleasure tonight to argue this out . It is a very important issue . Juliette and I have many things in common . We both were at Harvard for awhile . </s>
We have children who are about the same age . </s>
We also had the privilege of serving at both the federal level of government , in my case the local , her the state level . </s>
And that perspective for me was immensely valuable , to come to New York -- I was not a New Yorker , but I came here to work at the NYPD for four years . It gave me a different perspective on these issues and one that I think is illustrative . The easiest thing to do for us , in this debate , tactically , is just to sort of to decry the rhetorical excesses that frankly Juliette decried of the first few years after the Bush administration . It was a very divisive time in our political life , very troubling time , frankly . But I was struck today actually walking to this debate . </s>
I saw something that made me say I shouldn’t just dismiss it all completely , which was there was a fire truck going by , and it was making a big loud siren . And it was barreling to some emergency . </s>
And on the front , they had stenciled “Support our Troops , ” which said to me that the local responders , these local officials who were not in the military and have no extra authority gained from any of these laws that had been passed , in fact see a certain common purpose with the military officers and the intelligence officers who are still at war in a technical although somewhat invisible sense . And that’s , I think , a useful way to remember this . It isn’t the sense of unity that this country achieved post-9/11 about dealing with this problem also was a little bit a-historic , which is my way of saying , yes , there were many bad things that happened at that time , things that I criticized and , as Peter notes , I’ve written about it and talked about in papers and stuff like that . But there were also some good elements of it . And if there was no better way rhetorically to unify the various actions of many different parts of America , the military and the intelligence , the lawyers , the first responders , the rest , than War on Terror . </s>
That’s what they came up with , and it worked all right . So , on that basis , in addition to the legal arguments we’ve urged you to accept , I urge you to vote against this motion . Thank you , Richard Falkenrath . Our motion is “It is time to end the War on Terror , ” and here to speak for the motion , Juliette Kayyem , the national security and foreign policy columnist for the Boston Globe and former assistant secretary at the Department of Homeland Security . So General Hayden and Rich Falkenrath , I want to thank you both and thank you both for your service and this audience as well . </s>
They would have you believe that we simply want to repackage something , and they would have you believe that we would want to throw away laws that would have given Obama the authority to kill bin Laden . And they want you to believe that there’s this continuity of behavior over the course of the 10 years . And none of that is true . And I actually think none of it is true because , one , we’re not saying throw away the laws , throw away the authorization for the use of military force , nor is the War on Terror a benign statement . It is neither descriptive anymore nor is it benign . </s>
And the continuity has actually been one of the -- I think what’s happened over the last 10 years has been sort of remarkable because it was not continuous , that what you saw over time was the American public , Congress , the courts , the Supreme Court several times , the Bush administration itself with its own internal conflicts , and a change in leadership between the presidents , show that it wasn’t continuous . It’s not just the excesses that I said . It was actually what made us better , what made our counterterrorism measures better . </s>
And they got better over time , so that all sorts of things are not happening because of this learning curve . So now we’re supposed to wake up 10 years later and say , “Okay , well , that was -- it was good we called it that and let’s just continue calling it that because that was -- it’s benign , ” or , it’s just a legal matter . And all we’re asking you to do is actually think about that a little bit differently . Remember the 10 years , be grateful for the work of both administrations , but also realize the war on terror as a unifying force is no longer accurate or benign . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Juliette Kayyem . And that concludes our closing statements . And now it 's time to learn which side you feel has argued best . We 're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seats . Our motion is , it is time to end the war on terror . </s>
If you agree with the motion , push number one . If you disagree , push number two . And if you remain or became undecided , push number three . </s>
And we 're about two minutes away from having that number tabulated and compared to the opening votes , and we 'll be able to declare a winner . So before we get to that , I have a few things I want to take care of , beginning with wanting to thank this panel for the quality of the discussion that they brought here shall the respect -- </s>
-- they 've shown each other . Their expertise was on display as well as their respect for the power of a good argument . </s>
Also , is your daughter shy about taking bows in audiences ? She 's not ? So your children are , I 'm assuming , up in Boston . But one of Richard 's -- two of your kids are here . </s>
So why do n't you -- because they 're pretty young for a policy debate , so why do n't you stand up and -- Thank you . They looked at you with admiring eyes throughout the debate . I also want to take note of the fact that our audience includes a contingent from West Point . </s>
So I want to thank you guys and women for coming down here . And we had a number of people watching life stream on Slate . We want to thank them for -- for participating and watching and sending in the questions . And also for you as an audience , you were a terrific audience , and we did hear you , and I appreciated all of your applause , both spontaneous and rehearsed and requested by me . Thanks a lot for that . </s>
So we 're all going to be back here on Tuesday , September 20th . </s>
