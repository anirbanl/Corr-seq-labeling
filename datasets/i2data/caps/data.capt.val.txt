And this gentleman , red suspenders . Sir , if you can stand up , the camera will find you . You 're on the left side . And if you can just take a second , I want to make sure the camera has you . </s>
Okay . </s>
Go ahead and ask your question . I was hoping to hear something about the stiflage of the American spirit . </s>
I heard a lot about -- Sir , can you hold the mic closer to you and repeat the question because they ca n't hear you . I was hoping to hear more about the stiflage of the American spirit . I 'm not sure that I heard exactly what the American spirit is . </s>
How many people -- what percentage of the population has this American spirit now and what -- in what way is this stiflage going to have any effect on the rest of us who go about our quotidian daily lives . Laura Tyson . Yes . Let me say a little bit about that because I think we can also relate it to jobs . </s>
I mean , I think -- when I think about the American spirit , and I think about the current situation , I do worry most about young people . We have n't -- we 've talked about the government tonight . We have n't talked about state government . State governments do have balanced budgets . One of the reasons that you do n't feel so much of the federal stimulus effect is because states have had to contract a lot . </s>
And do you know where they contract ? </s>
They contract in education . That 's where they have to contract . So if you think of the American spirit as art programs , if you think of it as music programs , if you think of it as athletic programs , if you think of it as foreign language programs , if you think of it as your child going to school in a safe building structure that 's energy efficient , all of those things are being stifled , because the state revenues have collapsed because we are in a major recession . And the major recession was caused by a major financial shock . </s>
And frankly , again , there is no easy way out of this . And I for one think because the federal government can afford to borrow at very attractive very low interest rates near record low interest rates , we should be helping those who are unemployed get training , we should be helping teachers stay in school , we should be providing aid so that every single kid who wants to go to college right now can afford to go to college . What better time to go to college than right now ? </s>
So those are the ways in which I think the debt we inherited , the concern about deficits , the unwillingness to let the government help as it does -- as it 's helped throughout history in this kind of crisis , to help ordinary Americans achieve their spirit , that this is a real problem . Do you think , Laura , that -- do you think this -- the American spirit is presently stifled ? </s>
I think the American spirit has been -- the confidence in the U.S. has been shaken by the depth of the crisis we are in , and I think the way we are forcing cuts on basic services like education is certainly stifling the spirit and perhaps the life prospects of kids who are five , six , seven years old . Remember , we have 25 percent now -- almost 25 percent of children in poverty in the United States . You 've had a run , Laura , so let me bring in Phil Gramm , please . Phil . Well , let me first say I agree with you , you asked about how many people had it , the answer is `` not enough . '' </s>
To me the American spirit is a belief that based on your own merit , based on your own hard work , no matter who your daddy was or who he was n't , or who your mama was , that people are going to judge you on your ability , and that you have it within your power to succeed . Now , obviously it 's better to be -- -- it 's better to be clever , and pretty , and rich . But being plain , and ordinary , and poor , those things are not insurmountable obstacles in America . </s>
And it 's that belief of what we can do , but you ca n't have unlimited government and unlimited opportunity . You have to make a choice . Art and I are n't against government , but we believe that it has got to be limited if we 're going to have that kind of opportunity . </s>
And Americans are optimistic people because of who we are and what our history has been . We ca n't have France 's government and be Americans . Great . Could you rise , sir ? And I just -- ? Okay , they 've got you . </s>
To Mr. Roubini , I think we 're all agreed that one thing that is stifling to the American spirit is the financial crisis , as you noted in your remarks . Now , so whatever caused the financial crisis is presumably stifling to the American spirit , and has been noted , when you were last here , you successfully argued that government is the primary cause of the financial crisis , not the private sector , ergo , it is government that is stifling to the American spirit . So I ask you -- -- why are n't you sitting over there ? Now , I realize you 've just been the target of a personal attack . You know , when I was last here I argued that both the government and the private sector was to be blamed for the crisis and it was a crisis caused by many policy mistakes by those who -- by reckless risk taking , leverage , and debt of the private sector -- so it 's always a complicated story . </s>
But if the American spirit is stifled today , it is because this is not a mental recession , this is a real recession , this is the worst recession we have had since the Great Depression with unemployment rate now at 17 percent . We have nine million people out of work that have lost their jobs , and unless we address this problem , we 're not going to resolve this mental , and physical , and economic , and financial depression . </s>
Now , what can we do about jobs ? </s>
The CBO , Congressional Budget Office , did a study that suggested that of all the types of stimulus , the one that has the least effect on economic growth and job creation is reducing taxes for the rich . </s>
And the one that has the strongest effect on raising the demand for labor is to reduce the payroll tax both for employers and employees . </s>
And I proposed in an article recently a reduction temporarily in the payroll tax for employers and employees to be paid by the expiration of the tax cuts for the rich . </s>
They are expiring at the end of the year , so it’s not a budget busting reduction in taxes , it’s revenue neutral . We’re not going to increase the budget deficit that’s already one trillion and a half and stimulate economic growth . </s>
We have to stop subsidizing the rich . We have to start stimulating demand for labor for workers . That’s what we need to do . Art Laffer . </s>
Let me just carry Nouriel’s comments a little further and I do agree with him on that . </s>
Is when you look at a firm’s decision to hire a worker , that firm that makes its decision based upon the gross wages paid to the worker . The marginal product they have to get out of that worker has to cover the gross wages paid , inclusive of all costs . When you look at a worker’s decision to work , they look at net wages received . </s>
They couldn’t care less how much the firm pays . They care how much they get net . And there’s a wedge driven between wages paid and wages received , one on the demand curve and one on the supply curve of labor . What you’ve got to do is reduce that wedge to make it more attractive for firms to hire workers and more attractive for workers to work . One way of doing that is Nouriel’s comment here to lower the payroll taxes . </s>
That would work very well . Where I do disagree with him totally is on raising tax rates on the rich who are the people who do the employment . Let me tell you , these guys don’t employ workers for altruistic reasons . </s>
They employ the workers to get an after-tax profit of their own . </s>
And if you make it discouraging for them to employ workers , they’re not going to employ them . These people are the decision makers and that’s what you’ve really got to worry about . It’s not an equity argument of whether the rich can afford it or not . </s>
It’s whether they’ll disemploy people or not . Just look at their behavior . That’s what you’ve got to do . But he’s right . </s>
It’s the wedge between the wages paid and wages received and that is the key to bringing employment back . Everything we’re not doing today . Can I ask Art a question that actually combines something ? </s>
So Nouriel is suggesting , and it’s something I also support , thinking about bringing the top two Bush tax cuts for the top two percent down back to the Clinton era and using the money which is 30 to 40 billion dollars next year either for a payroll tax deduction or for more aid to the states or for a number of other things . </s>
Now you suggested that , Art , that you were concerned about raising taxes on the rich . This would basically be bringing them back to the Clinton level , which you thought was fine . It actually worked really well . </s>
No . I thought the program was fine . So we need the revenue -- no but that was a key part of his program . Give me -- that was the first -- as Nouriel has already said , that was the first thing that he did . The reason that the Democrats lost control of the Congress in 1994 is because the Republicans claimed that the Democrats were responsible for the largest middle class tax increase in history . </s>
Do you know what that was ? </s>
A four and a half cent gasoline tax , okay ? </s>
So I say you think those taxes of the Clinton administration were fine , let’s go back to them , take the money which is 40 billion dollars next year and my goodness we could find several ways , the CBO listed about 10 different ways of using that money to create more jobs . Alright , I have to do a quick piece of radio for radio right now . Our motion is “Big government is stifling the American Spirit.” This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I’m John Donvan of ABC News . We are in the question and answer section of this debate . </s>
We have four debaters , two teams of two , debating this motion , “Big government is stifling the American spirit.” And I want to take to this side a specific recommendation that Nouriel makes in his new book about Wall Street compensation . He talks about the need to cure compensation and he’s not talking about the amounts . </s>
He’s talking about the way in which it is structured , which he said helped encourage practices that led to the financial crisis . Moreover , he says government needs to be involved in this process of curing compensation on Wall Street . Your response to that concept . </s>
Well look , I want to say one thing about rich people . </s>
How many people poorer than you -- So Phil , can you answer my question ? -- have ever hired you ? Mr. Gramm , can you answer my question ? </s>
I’ll be glad to . Thank you . The last thing in the world we need is the government setting peoples’ compensation in the private sector . I work for a big investment bank . </s>
Some people we pay a lot of money to . </s>
Do we want to pay it ? </s>
No . The problem is they’ll go to work for somebody else . That 's what 's called competition . </s>
And when we start setting our value judgment as the standard by which we 're going to gauge value , we start making a mistake . Now , I do n't have any problem with deferred comp that tie people 's objectives to long-term earning . But the idea that government ought to be involved in setting compensation is as alien to the American spirit as any idea can be . </s>
Nouriel Roubini . The problem was that we -- the problem was we privatized the gains , the bonuses , the profits in good times . And then those guys led to a reckless financial crisis . And now we socialize the losses , and everybody here has to pay for those compensations . That 's why the government has to interfere , I’m sorry to say , because a $ 2 trillion bailout of Wall Street , who is paying for it ? </s>
We are paying for it . the government doing that . </s>
And you do n't want any control on compensation either . Art Laffer , repeat . </s>
Repeat . </s>
That is the problem with government . Nouriel just said it right . </s>
Nouriel , let me just so -- you said it right . The government should n't bail these guys out . They should n't bail out the housing industry . They should n't bail out any of these guys . </s>
The only bail outs you should do are for individuals -- We privatized the gains . We socialized the losses . -- who are unemployed or ca n't help themselves for a time period . </s>
But it should n't be 99 weeks . </s>
That does n't make any sense . It just makes it so it 's not worth the working . And by the way , Laura , one factual thing . I did support Bill Clinton , and I thought he was a great president from that standpoint . I did not agree with that tax increase . </s>
Please do n't put that on me . </s>
I thought he did lots of other things that way overwhelmed that . Okay . But that was one thing I did not support . </s>
Okay . Sir , you have a neck tie , and if you stand up , a mic will come to you . That 's everybody , I know . Okay . </s>
Go ahead , please . Pardon me if I get my facts wrong , Senator Gramm . But it is my understanding that the bank that you served as chairman , UBS , received a bailout from the government of Switzerland . Do you feel as though that is incongruous with the position you are taking in this debate ? </s>
What -- can you -- can you tell me what -- how you are relating that to our motion ? Well , it 's the role of government in the private sector . Yeah , the bailout . It may not be the American government . All right . </s>
Fair enough . I just wanted to get that clarified . Well , let me say -- I guess you can tell by my accent I 'm not from Zurich . Had I been in Swiss politics , I would not have been for the bailout . </s>
It is clear to me we would have survived and prospered without it . </s>
I do believe , however , that it is important to note that it was government , through CRA , pressuring banks to make subprime loans . It was federal quotas on Freddie and Fannie where they had to hold more and more subprime paper . As our dear colleague argued when he was last here , this was a crisis made in Washington . I also think it 's important to note -- and I 'm not here to defend a bank bailout . But I think it 's pretty clear Freddie and Fannie have not paid their money back and probably never will . </s>
Almost all the banks have paid it back with a profit . Laura Tyson . </s>
Who owns Fannie and Freddie ? I 'd like to say two things about this financial crisis , one is just to recommend a book , because I have used history a lot tonight , and I have n't cited the book . The book is called This Time It 's Different . It 's a great book . Everyone should read it . </s>
It 's based on an analysis of financial crises over a time and across countries . You do n't have to mention -- there 's no Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in that book . </s>
There 's no particular piece of legislation . There are some basic things that are true in financial crises . They have to do with overleverage . They have to do with interest rates which are too low . </s>
Credit was too cheap . People get overleveraged . They have to do with overconfidence . People basically are overconfident . </s>
We know this from more and more studies of how people make economic decisions . So the first point is we should just -- we should n't debate the cause of the crisis in terms of a particular piece of legislation or a particular institution . </s>
We should go and look at history . And -- </s>
Laura , how does your point relate against our motion ? My point is about the bailout . My point is about right now we are looking at the size of government at a crisis moment that we have not lived through before , anyone in this room , that occasionally societies go through , that when that happens , governments tend to increase in size . </s>
They double , they triple . </s>
The government debt as a share of GDP rises by 85 percent . There are huge mop-up operations . And to say a bailout , why did the government step in ? </s>
You know , frankly , it was not for tears for Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns or any of the banks that received federal money . It was because credit markets had closed down . It is because money market funds were about to go under . It was because things that you relied upon as you put your money in the money market , and it was worth -- put in $ 500 , when you went , there was $ 500 . There was n't going to be $ 500 . </s>
So this was a bailout of the financial system . There was a run on the financial system . Capitalist economies can not run without finance . </s>
There was no solution -- So you 're saying it was time for the government to act . I 'm saying the government had to act . It had to get bigger . </s>
We can debate the cause , but we may as well deal with the reality . That was the reality . I have a -- -- question in the second row . Go to a question here . </s>
And if you could stand , please , and remember with the microphone . I think it 's very interesting that this debate has really revolved around whether tax cuts should happen in the fall or not . But I actually think you really missed the whole question . And that is where should investment whether -- regardless of the size of the government , what areas should our government or -- actually invest in directly or incentivize , whether it 's science , technology , is it education , is it oil , is it energy ? </s>
This is what we 're not talking about . If the American spirit is defined as innovation and creativity , you guys have n't discussed it , none of you . So I 'm very curious as to what your top three investments would be and how it would happen ? Can I -- can I say that I thought -- </s>
Laura , I want to let Phil Gramm because , see , you had a run . Well , first of all , it is hard for me to see government as a driver of creativity and innovation . </s>
It is generally an impeder of those things . It 's just not true . Now look . There are always areas of government you could do more in . Everybody talks about education . </s>
We have dramatically increased spending in education , and quality has fallen because we let education be dominated by a monopoly , the teacher 's union . </s>
So we need to make some dramatic reforms . But look , here is the problem , and I agree with Laura , we do have a special circumstance . </s>
We have a crisis . But when you 're looking at the debt burden that we 're piling up now , that 's not going to go away when the crisis goes away , the problem with saying let 's do this later -- Phil , I have to interrupt because I thought this question was one that everybody was going to hear the answer to . Her question is what areas would you invest in . What would be the three areas where you put direct investment ? </s>
Through government . Through government . Well , first of all , I think the best investment government can make is to put its financial house in order so that we can have a functioning private system so that we can have more private investment and more job creation . So the first thing I 'd invest in is deficit reduction . The second thing that I would invest in is science . </s>
Science -- basic science , not taking an idea and commercializing it , something government knows absolutely nothing about , and where every day somewhere in the world we see some huge program where the Japanese invested in high definition television , invested huge amounts of money , and it ended up the market went the other direction , it was all lost . So basic science , basic knowledge , basic ability to do things -- not just to cure people quicker and better , but to do it cheaper . We have virtually no investment in healthcare in economy . If I bought groceries the way I buy healthcare , where somebody else pays 95 cents out of every dollar , I 'd eat different , and so would my dog . And that -- </s>
Okay , so -- That 's the problem in healthcare . </s>
So you 've got two answers to your question . I want to see if Laura Tyson has another . I just feel like I need to repeat , and maybe I have indeed failed as a debater -- </s>
If you 're repeating too much , I 'll stop you . My comment in my opening statement was precisely that . I identified exactly where I thought the government should invest . The government used to spend much more on basic science and research . It used to spend much more on infrastructure . </s>
Those are areas . And it used -- and it must spend much more on higher education . This is not -- federal government does n't spend much on K through 12 . Higher education . So I look at the research . </s>
90 percent of the growth in labor productivity , which is the driving force of how productive the nation is and what we can afford to pay ourselves , 90 percent comes from investments in those three areas , higher education , research and science , and infrastructure , and the U.S. government used to spend 69 percent of its budget on it , and now it only spends 32 percent . And what is squeezing that out ? What 's squeezing that out is entitlements and interest on the debt , because we are unwilling to pay for the things we need to pay for . </s>
So that 's the tradeoff , yes , the U.S. government is not investing enough in your future , in our future . </s>
But it 's very clear where it should be making those investments . There 's a gentleman in an orange jacket , and if you could come around , I 'll come to you as the next question , I just wanted to ask you to get into a position for that . And the woman -- yes , you just did if you could rise , the mic will come up to you . And again , short questions are working very well tonight . </s>
Yes , we -- tonight we heard a lot about this `` Irresponsible Bush tax cut , ” quite a bit from Nouriel and Laura . </s>
I just wanted to hear what they think about the recent one trillion dollar entitlement packages the Obama administration just passed at the depth of the crisis . And I would think that is a perfect example of big government stifling the American spirit , and I would like to hear what they think about that . Why do you think it 's a -- -- let me ask her for clarification , please -- why do you think that that 's an example ? </s>
Because I think it changed people 's expectation about the government 's role in the society . taking much more role and must be much more invasive , and also basically increased people 's expectation that it takes -- taxes are bound to go up . Okay , thank you . Laura Tyson . </s>
I just need a clarification . The one trillion dollars -- are you referring to healthcare reform ? </s>
Okay , so what we know about this is that again the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has basically determined that that package if put in place will actually reduce the deficit . It will reduce the deficit . Now -- -- all right . </s>
The reason you do n't -- No . The reason you do n't believe that if you 're laughing -- the reason you do n't believe that if you 're laughing is because you do n't believe that healthcare costs in the United States in the private sector are going to slow down , because the only way , the only way we can get control over the federal government 's healthcare spending , which is now more than half of all healthcare spending in the United States , is if private healthcare costs slow down . Remember , we 're spending three times as much as any other advanced industrial country . There are lots of other models out there . They 're not all socialized medicine . </s>
We are doing a lousy job in the healthcare sector . Sir , can you come down into the -- where the lights -- we 'll be able to see you ? About five more steps . So I think that the one trillion dollars has basically been credited as something that will pay for itself if we get healthcare costs down . And if you laugh it 's because you do n't think that will happen to our society , and then we 're not going to be better off . </s>
Sir . </s>
As a lonely citizen -- </s>
Can you bring the mic and start again closer ? Sure . That 's great , thanks . </s>
As just one citizen , is it fair that I have a right to keep more of what I earn or should I be required to give more ? Yeah . Well , that 's red meat to you guys . Well , first of all -- </s>
Enjoy . I think -- I 'll come back to you . -- that we define freedom far too narrowly . </s>
The question we 've been asked is a question about freedom . To what degree should the people be able to keep what they earn ? To what degree does a person own and therefore have the right to keep the product of the sweat of their brow ? </s>
I was always amazed when I was in government at all of the empathy that went to people who were riding in the wagon that were benefiting from government , but no empathy for people that were pulling the wagon . On welfare you can get $ 17,500 of benefits per child , and under the federal tax code , if you work for a living , you get $ 1,000 tax credit per child . Should n't we give people pulling the wagon the same benefits we give people riding in the wagon ? Laura Tyson ? </s>
This is going to be the end of this section , so it 's time for your flourish . End of this section -- this is not the two-minute -- </s>
No , no , no , no . But your response is going to conclude our second round -- The one point we have n't raised tonight because we 've talked a lot about taxing the rich and we 've talked a lot about the past , so I think it 's important to know that the last time the income distribution was as unequal in the United States as it was in 2008 was 1928 . That the share of income going to the top one percent the top 0.01 percent is larger than it’s ever been in our country and we need to just think about that . </s>
Now that goes to the issue and I ended a comment I made before about we need to also think about the fact that now about a quarter of our children live in poverty . This is about the kind of society one wants . It’s not actually about freedom or lack of freedom . It’s about what kind of society one wants . And I think that if you take the idea if you own your own self , the sort of logical conclusion of that is that nobody makes any contribution to the common good unless they feel like it , unless they feel like it . </s>
So that means we’d have no justice department . </s>
We’d have no defense . </s>
We’d have no education . It would basically be what’s mine is mine and I’m going back to my house and taking it with me . I don’t think that is the notion of what most Americans think is the fair society they want to live in . </s>
Thank you , Laura Tyson and that concludes round two of our debate and here we are . We are about to hear closing statement from each debater . We are about to hear closing statements from each debater . They will be two minutes each and it’s their last chance to change your minds and after they speak you’re going to be asked to vote once again and to pick the winner , just a few minutes from now . But first , round three , closing statements . </s>
Our motion is “Big government is stifling the American spirit , ” and here to make her closing statement against this motion , Laura Tyson , a professor at the Haas School of Business at Berkeley and a member of President Obama’s Economic Recovery Advisory Board . Well I think to a certain extent you’ve heard part of my closing statement . I will just reiterate my main points . I think that citizens look to government to do things . Right now the government has been forced to do more than it normally does because of the crisis . </s>
I believe the government will get smaller once the crisis -- we’ve gotten through the crisis but I think it’s important to do that . I think it is important for the government to invest in our future and I’ve made that clear how the government should do that . I’ve noted that we haven’t talked at all tonight about , amazingly enough , defense . Defense . If we really want to make the U.S. government smaller , do we really want to spend 20 percent of the government’s budget on defense and 43 percent of the world’s spending on weapons ? </s>
Do we really want -- do we think that’s fair ? And finally I would say that I do think that we need to , as a society , ask ourselves the question about what kinds of benefits we want , what are we willing to pay for . Because what has happened in the starving the beast mentality is we actually have made the tax base smaller . </s>
We don’t tax even at the levels of the Clinton administration , but we’ve made the government bigger . </s>
You know , not only did we fight two wars without financing them under President George W. Bush , but we also passed the Medicare prescription drug benefit program . That was more than a trillion dollars . No funding . None . </s>
The CBO said that would cost a trillion dollars with no funding . </s>
The CBO in the trillion-dollar bill that was just passed said it paid for itself . </s>
So where was the big entitlement with no funding ? It came under George W. Bush . </s>
My point is if we want that kind of benefit , we’d better be serious about how to pay for it because right now , our government is not that big . It’s not that big . of GDP but we’re funding it -- Laura Tyson , your time is up and thank you very much . help from the rest of the world . We don’t want to do that . </s>
Thank you , Laura Tyson . Our motion is “Big government is stifling the American spirit” and here to summarize his position for this motion is Phil Gramm , a former Senator and chairman of the banking committee , currently vice-chairman at UBS Investment Bank . </s>
I believe that government is stifling the American spirit and I believe that we’ve reached a crisis point . When we look ten years into the future and we see government taking almost half of all income taxes simply to pay interest on the debt , this is a future that I don’t want for America . Now we can avoid this future but we can’t avoid it by waiting for somebody else to fix this problem . </s>
We can’t avoid it by taking a poll . We’ve got to have leadership . We’ve got to explain to America what is at stake . </s>
And I don’t want to dwell on the past . I was asked about the past versus the future but the past is the only thing we know about the future . When Ronald Reagan became president , people sensed that we had a crisis . We had wasted ten years of economic growth with stagnation , double digit inflation , high unemployment . And we had to make hard decisions . </s>
America made those decisions because they believed there was a crisis . I believe there 's a crisis today . And more importantly , I believe that Americans believe it . But what they 're waiting on is leadership to show them the alternative . It 's just like at the end with the medical analogy , you get sick , you go to the doctor . </s>
The options he gives you are often not very palatable , especially if you 're very sick . But you do it because you believe that you will get better if you do those things . I believe Americans can show courage and can show sacrifice if they believe that America will be benefited in the end . And that 's what this crisis is about . Phil Gramm , your time is up . </s>
Thank you very much . The motion is “Big government is stifling the American spirit.” And here to summarize his position against the motion , Nouriel Roubini , a professor at New York university Stern School of Business and chairman of Roubini Global Economics . </s>
Is American spirit stifled because of big government ? Not at all , because tax revenues today are the lowest level they have been in the last 50 years . 15 percent of GDP . It used to be an average of 20 . </s>
In Europe , they 're around 40 , 50 percent . So the problem is not with too much taxes . Is the American spirit stifled because we have a mental recession today ? No . We have the worst economic and financial crisis , recession and depression , we 've had in the last few decades . </s>
And why do we have it ? Because we tried twice in the ’80s and again in the last decade an experiment in voodoo economics . Every time they 're in power , they pretend that they want to starve the beast , but increase -- instead recklessly reduce tax rates in a way that 's unsustainable . They increase massively discretionary spending and military spending . And then because economic and financial crisis , and then they leave a trillion dollar budget deficit to the next administration . </s>
It 's just a train wreck for somebody else to take care of it . It happened during the Bush-Reagan years of the 1980s . </s>
And it took Clinton to raise taxes and reduce the budget deficit and turn it into a surplus . It happened again with the Bush tax cuts of the last decade that led to the worst economic and financial crisis since the Great Depression . Every time they talk , they blame everything on big government . But the true agenda is different . Every time they pass reckless and unsustainable tax cuts , mostly for the rich , they privatize in good times , that gains them the profits . </s>
And after they cause a massive economic and financial crisis , they socialize all the losses and bail out Wall Street . </s>
They privatize the gains . They socialize the losses . They do n't believe in capitalism . They do n't believe in small government . </s>
They do n't believe in the American spirit . They believe in big government , socialist and welfare for the rich , the well connected and for Wall Street . </s>
That 's what they do . Thank you , Nouriel Roubini . The motion is “Big government is stifling the American spirit.” </s>
And our final speaker to summarize his position in support of this motion , Arthur Laffer , chairman of Laffer Associates and a former economic advisor to President Reagan . If I can just start off by looking at the issue at hand here today , is big government stifling the American spirit ? I think that at least three if not all four of us agree that that is the case . I mean , I look at Nouriel Roubini , what he 's been saying , and it 's been exactly what we 've been saying . Laura has been talking about the defense budgets and all of that . </s>
That is big government . </s>
Should we be in Iraq ? Should we be in Afghanistan ? That 's a big government intervention , which does n't make a lot of sense to me . Should we socialize all the -- no , but I -- hold that . Should we socialize all the losses for these companies ? </s>
Absolutely not . But you ca n't have a profit and loss system without losses . For people who overborrowed on their income , for banks that were undercapitalized , if they made a play , and it 's wrong , let them lose . Just let it go and let the system work and go . </s>
Government is way too big . </s>
Should we invest in a flat rate tax where the government 's not meddling in every single person ? Yes , we should . </s>
We should do all of that . Government is way too big , and it is stifling the American spirit as these two and the two of us all agree . If I can -- You know , I think Phil Gramm , a little story is the correct story . </s>
I think his facts are great , but I think you ca n't have more people sitting in the wagon than you have pulling it . </s>
I used to tell my students that if I ran this class like your government runs your country , what I 'd do is I 'd flunk all the A students out , and I 'd give all the F students scholarships . So before you laugh , think about it for a second before you laugh . My A students are a little bit smarter than my F students . So once I changed the rules , my A students are able to get lower grades than my F students because they do n't randomly make the mistake of ever guessing a correct answer . </s>
The distribution of grades is unchanged , period . There 's not one change . But what have I done ? I 've destroyed the entire quality of the educational process . </s>
You can not change the distribution of income with taxes . But you can change the volume . Government is too big , and it 's stifling the American spirit , as we all agree up here . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Art Laffer . And that concludes our opening statements . And now -- now it is time to learn which side has argued best , because you in our audience will make that decision . </s>
We are asking you again to push the keypad at your seat that will register your vote . And we 'll get the readout on this almost instantaneously . You were asked to vote when you came in , to tell us where you stand on the motion . We 're asking you again . </s>
And the team that changes the most minds will be declared our winner . The motion is big government is stifling the American spirit . Press one if you are for the motion , two if you are against , and three if you are undecided . </s>
And we 'll have the results in just a minute . </s>
So while that 's being tabulated , the first thing I want to do is I want to thank all the questioners and the folks who stood up and gave their opinions . </s>
The questions were terrific , sometime a little tricky to get the questions answered , but I think we worked that out . </s>
So thank you to all of you for your questions . Tell me again . </s>
Oh , I made a mistake in a line -- just now when the debate ended , and I wanted to say that concludes our closing statements , I said that concludes our opening statements , which was a mistake because it was at the wrong end . And it would help me a great deal if you could do one more round of applause , and I 'll get the line right . </s>
But -- but -- No , but I need this to be so spontaneous . </s>
And that concludes our closing statements . </s>
And now it is time to learn which side of the argument fell . Thank you . Thank you to all of you . </s>
And I also want to thank our panel . You know , when it suddenly dawned on me that we had four PhD economists , I kind of thought , oh boy . But no , this was robust and engaged and spirited . And I thank all of you for really bringing your A games to this . </s>
So before we announce the votes which are being tabulated , a few things that I want to talk about coming up for us . Our next debate will be very soon . </s>
Wednesday , November 10th , the motion is “Afghanistan is a lost cause.” Panelists for the motion are Matthew Hoh . He 's a former State Department official . </s>
He resigned in protest over U.S. strategic policy in Afghanistan . </s>
Also , his partner will be Nir Rosen , a freelance journalist and author of Aftermath , Following the Bloodshed of America 's Wars in the Muslim World . Against the motion , we 'll have Peter Bergen , who he is the gentleman who filmed Osama Bin Laden 's first television interview for CNN 13 years ago . And his debating partner will be Max Boot , a Council on Foreign Relations military historian and a foreign policy analyst and the author of a fascinating book which I have read , called War Made New . Individual tickets are still available by visiting our website and at the Skirball box office . </s>

After the debate , 49 percent are for the motion , that 's up 20 percent , 43 percent against , that 's down one percent , we have eight percent undecided . </s>
The side arguing for the debate has carried this debate . Our congratulations to them . Thank you from me , John Donvan , from Intelligence Squared U.S. We 'll see you next time . …Okay , all of our preliminaries are out of the way , at this point , we’re going to begin the evening and it’s pleasure to introduce , to set the stage and set the theme , the chairman of Intelligence Squared , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Thank you very much and welcome . </s>
Well , it’s my role in these evenings to frame the debate , and I think for most New Yorkers , we’re all very familiar with the liberal critique of George W. Bush . But even from a conservative perspective , the Bush presidency could be seen as far worse than than Bill Clinton’s . Clinton was for free trade , he spent a lot of political capital getting NAFTA through , versus the Bush administration with steel tariffs and ethanol subsidies . Clinton had welfare reform . This administration has had the first new entitlement of great scale in the last 40 years in prescription drugs for the elderly . </s>
Clinton had a balanced budget . This administration has had absolutely out of control public spending . On the other hand , consider the following . </s>
This administration accomplished something that nobody would’ve thought possible—they kept America safe after 9-11 . And then think about a President like Nixon who was so reviled in his time , but whose rapprochement with China really set the stage , geopolitically for everything that transpired , the collapse of the Soviet Union , the emergence of the Chinese economy . </s>
Sometimes the historic perspective gives a very , very different view than what you see at the moment . And finally consider Jimmy Carter . </s>
He invented the term “stagflation , ” we had 13 percent inflation , no economic growth , 19 percent interest rates . He abandoned the Shah of Iran who was a staunch American ally , enabled the ayatollahs to take over in Iran . His ineptitude during the hostage crisis emboldened Russia to invade Afghanistan . He was a truly awful President . So , there’s a lot to be said on both sides here . </s>
And it’s my pleasure now to turn the evening over to John Donvan , and the outstanding panel that we’ve assembled tonight . </s>
Thank you , and may I just invite one more round of applause , sustained applause for Mr. Rosenkranz for making all of this possible . Welcome to the Symphony Space in New York City , we are here with a sold-out audience , for an Intelligence Squared US debate , in which the motion is , “George W. Bush is the worst American President of the last 50 years , ” that is , “Bush 43 is the worst President of the last 50 years.” I’m John Donvan , your host and moderator , and tonight we have , arguing for the motion , an esteemed panel , to my left , to your right , beginning with Jacob Weisberg , who is editor-in-chief of Slate and author of The Bush Tragedy . Joining him on the same team , Simon Jenkins , a distinguished British newspaper editor and commentator . </s>
Arguing against the motion , to your far right , Karl Rove , former deputy chief of staff to President Bush . And his debating partner , Bill Kristol , editor of The Weekly Standard and chief of staff for former Vice President Dan Quayle . The Intelligence Squared and Intelligence Squared US debates are supported by the Rosenkranz Foundation . </s>
Now , shortly you will be hearing from our four panelists , two for the motion , and two arguing against . But this evening is a contest , a contest of wit and skill and logic and ideas and in that contest , you are the judges , we are going to poll you twice during the program , once now and once later . We want to poll you to see where you stand on the motion . </s>
After that the debate will be open for our opening statements , and then we’ll come to questions from you , the audience . </s>
So , if you turn to those keypads that each of you had at your seat…as we explained before , it’ll only take a moment to vote , you press 1 if you agree with the motion that George W. Bush is the worst American President of the last 50 years , 2 if you do not agree , that Bush 43 is the worst President of the last 50 years . And number 3 , if at this point you are undecided . Does anyone need more time ? </s>
Terrific . We’ll come to those results shortly after we hear the opening statements from the panelists . For this point let us say , let the debate begin , our motion is , George W. Bush is the worst President of the last 50 years , Bush 43 is the worst President of the last 50 years . Arguing first for the motion is Jacob Weisberg , a chairman and editor-in-chief of the Slate Group . He has just published a book , a history of the Bush family in politics , its title , gives you a sense of where he is coming from on this debate , it is called The Bush Tragedy . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Jacob Weisberg . If you need more time I’m afraid I can’t help you . I’d like to thank Bob Rosenkranz and Intelligence Squared . I feel like I’ve spent most of the past year watching Presidential debates , it’s nice to finally be in one . Please don’t change your minds , Bush was obviously the worst President of the past 50 years . </s>
Yet the task Simon and I have tonight is extremely difficult . </s>
We have to convince a small fraction of you , at least if you’re anything like the people who have given Bush the lowest approval rating of any post-war President , who still resist that conclusion . And to be honest I’m not sure that people who still defend the Bush Presidency are entirely open to persuasion . But I wan na try , by talking a little about how much Bush has done wrong and how little he’s done right . </s>
Let me first just tell you a little bit about my own perspective on this , I am not a Bush hater . I’m not someone who can be described as a partisan Democrat , the way Mr. Kristol and Mr. Rove are partisan Republicans . </s>
I’m a centrist liberal , I’m fairly hawkish on security issues , I’m in favor of limited government . And let me just state up front , I think George W. Bush was a fine governor of Texas . </s>
I think Ronald Reagan was a successful President , and I think George H. W. Bush , 41 , understood foreign policy better than all but a few Presidents in the post-war era . About two years ago , I started writing a book about the Bush Presidency . And I was gon na spend a lot of time on Bush’s successes and accomplishments . </s>
And I’ll admit that I wanted to do that not just to be fair , but so I would look fair . And , I looked for the successes and accomplishments , and I looked , and I looked , and I came back totally empty-handed . There were a number of areas where I expected to stick up for Bush , but I really found it impossible . For example , I was sympathetic to his approach to education reform . But even from a conservative perspective , Bush didn’t allow— provide enough resources to allow for any real mobility or choice in public schools . </s>
Instead of national standards which we needed he let the states write their own tests . That’s what the conservative base wanted . </s>
They don’t believe the federal government should be involved in education at all , and in caving in to them Bush ensured that he’d make little meaningful progress on education and in fact , he has made very little meaningful progress . I thought Bush was right about the need for immigration reform . And then I watched him surrender to the xenophobes and nativists in his own party . I thought Bush was right to spend a lot of money fighting AIDS in Africa . And then I watched him save far fewer lives than he might have , because of religious extremists , again in his own party , who believe abstinence propaganda’s more effective than condoms . </s>
I thought Bush was right about free trade , and then I watched his lack of leadership lead to the collapse of the most important item on the global trade agenda , the Doha development route . </s>
So , those are the partial successes . I can’t hope to cover all Bush’s failures tonight . What would be a top failure for a President doesn’t even really make his top five . </s>
So , never mind his incompetent response to Hurricane Katrina , it doesn’t make the cut . Never mind his denial of climate change and eight lost years on global warming , that doesn’t make the cut either . I’m just going to give you my top five . Number one is the invasion of Iraq . This was the most important decision of the Bush Presidency and he made it on the basis , as I think we all know , of the false premise that Saddam Hussein was threatening America with weapons of mass destruction , and consorting with al-Qaeda . </s>
Now I’m not someone who believes that Bush deliberately falsified the evidence . But I believe he was totally uninterested in the evidence . This war would never have been fought , if Bush had been interested in the truth as opposed to finding a pretext for something he wanted to do . </s>
I think his second biggest failure is the mismanaged occupation of Iraq . Bush refused for more than three years to change a failed military strategy . And almost the whole time people like my friend Mr. Kristol here were desperately insisting , rightly in my view , that Bush needed to move to a counterinsurgency strategy . </s>
Bush said , essentially , don’t bother me with the details . He delegated the strategy to Rumsfeld and he ignored the failure . I think the surge has helped tremendously in Iraq , the outrage is that Bush moved to it in 2007 , not in 2003 or 2004 . His third biggest failure is undermining Constitutional rights , and American ideals . Now I can’t go into detail here about all the ways he abused his authority , and disregarded the rights of both foreigners and American citizens . </s>
But he and Vice President Cheney opened the door to torture , which led directly to the horrors of Abu Ghraib . He effectively suspended habeas corpus , holding suspects for years without charge or trail , and he took a perverse view of his office , claiming that virtually limitless executive authority was part of the inherent power of the Presidency . His fourth failure was sabotaging American unity after September 11th . The day after the attacks , the front page of La Monde in Paris said “We are all Americans.” </s>
The whole world was with us . But Mr. Bush and Mr. Rove saw September 11th as a political opportunity for what Spiro Agnew called , “positive polarization.” Now Simon is gon na speak to the harm , that this did to America’s image in the world . </s>
But I would just say , with a new administration coming into office , never in more than 200 years of our history has restoring America’s around the world been such an urgent project for a new President . </s>
Number five , my last , is Bush’s catastrophic economic mismanagement , which is so current we hardly even need to spell it out . </s>
It remains to be seen whether we’re facing a depression , whether Bush will stand in for Herbert Hoover . But I think it’s clear that we’re living through the direct result of an ideological refusal to sensibly regulate financial markets . Bush says he’s sorry about all the lost jobs , if you saw his interview on ABC last night . </s>
But , as he loses his , the interesting question is whether he ever understood , or understood now , his own contribution . Now our opponents this evening , may try to argue that Richard Nixon or Jimmy Carter was worse . But neither of those Presidents failed as badly as Bush . Carter had the Camp David agreement , and despite Watergate , Nixon left historic accomplishments including opening relations with China , and creating the Environmental Protection Agency . </s>
Neither of them rivals Bush for sheer , all-pervading incompetence . But if our opponents tonight— Thank you . I’m closing here , if our opponents tonight wish to argue that Bush was only the second worst President of the last 50 years , that’s not much of a defense . This national nightmare , I would suggest , has been the deepest and longest of all . Thank you , Jacob Weisberg . </s>
And actually perfect timing . Bill Kristol is the editor of the influential Washington-based political magazine The Weekly Standard . Just over a year ago he wrote a piece predicting that President Bush’s Presidency would be remembered ultimately by history as a successful one . </s>
We bumped into each other on the street last week , and he said , “I’m still prepared to argue that , but can I leave out the US economy.” Bill Kristol , ladies and gentlemen . Well , thanks , John , I’m still happy to argue that and it’s the truth— It’s good to be back on the Upper West Side , let me say I grew up just a mile from here , Bella Abzug was my Congresswoman . And that made me a conservative . Right . </s>
A decision I’ve not regretted , since then . Bush was not my first choice , George W. Bush was not my first choice for the Republican nomination for the Presidency in 2000 , I’ve had my quarrels with the Bush administration , but he’s been a pretty good President . He’s , it’s— Well… As we sit here safely , seven years after 9-11 , having won a war in Iraq , we can snicker and laugh with the US economy having grown 18 percent over the last eight years , faster than any other Western advanced country , with the prescription drug benefits having been passed that has benefited many seniors which Bush gets no credit at all which he took on his own party for , on issues like immigration he valiantly took on his own party and did an awful lot to try to get that through . </s>
Bush has actually been a pretty impressive President , it’s unfortunate that the public has , for various reasons , some of them good , soured on Bush , and he’s done a horrible job , his administration , of explaining what they’ve done and what the choices were . In the real world the choices are not , you know , perfection , and a pretty good Presidency , in the real world he’s made a lot of tough decisions , most of them correct . When he became President al- Qaeda was ascendant , Saddam Hussein was contained but unsustainably so , unless you think we could’ve had sanctions and inspectors for the last eight years . North Korea and Iran were secretly working on nuclear weapons programs , A. Q. Khan was dispensing nuclear material and know-how all over the world , Pakistan had exploded a nuclear weapon , in 1998 . </s>
Then , 9-11 , Bush reacted to that correctly , basically . We have been protected here since then , we have al-Qaeda on the run internationally . People can talk all they want about—there are a couple of things he did that he shouldn’t have done , these have been— they were fixed by people in his own administration . Jack Goldsmith , Attorney General Ashcroft , Attorney General Mukasey , have fixed some of the mistakes that were made under the pressure of trying to defend this country against a ruthless terrorist group that had taken 3,000 lives , history will look kindly on Bush’s performance as a national security and homeland security President . And one piece of the proof is that Obama is not going to change much . </s>
As the Obama people get briefed on the threats , they see that the surveillance program is necessary . I suppose Obama will close Guantanamo and move , in effect , Guantanamo here to the United States and put the people at Fort Leavenworth but he’s not going to release these people into the US . </s>
Enhanced interrogation techniques which McCain and Obama oppose , so I guess I’m a lonely person in defending those , saved an awful lot of lives when used on Khalid Sheik Mohammed and I’m not willing to second-guess the decision , to use those techniques . </s>
Bush was a strong President on national security , the decision to go into Iraq was necessary I think . The Middle East today , with Saddam in power , or his sons in power , with terror connections , redeveloping the weapons of mass destruction programs presumably , since I don’t think we could’ve kept sanctions on , and inspectors in for eight years , would’ve been a much more dangerous place . </s>
The decision to go with the surge was a courageous decision , made in December 2006 , January 2007 under great adverse pressure , with very little public support , very little support from the Republican establishment , no support , obviously from almost any Democrats except Joe Lieberman . It was the right decision , it’s been utterly vindicated . </s>
Have we ever seen really , this kind of real-time test . Bush said let’s do this , here’s what will happen , here’s how we’ll work , these critics said it can’t work , it wasn’t working , you’re crazy , more lives are gon na be thrown away , and we had a real-time test of who was right and who was wrong . </s>
And now Barack Obama of course being an intelligent person , admits that the surge worked , and we are now beginning to draw down in a position of success in Iraq , not leaving a country that would’ve been a breeding ground for terror , I mean the degree to which Bush does not get enough credit , for refusing to cut and run in 2007 in Iraq , the degree to which people don’t appreciate the strategic , the geostrategic disaster that would’ve been , remains kind of amazing to me . We have a pretty good outcome in Iraq , a very important ally in the Middle East , that has sacrificed a lot in fighting terror groups , that is standing with us against Iran , that has signed just a Status of Forces agreement with us , that will be a strategic partner with us . In a way this could be a strategic victory that could be the flip- side of the strategic defeat that the Iranian revolution in 1979 , was . The rest of Bush’s foreign policy has been…I have my quarrels with some of it , but most of it’s been pretty successful , the relationship with India , the management of the China and Japan relationships . The Europeans have been annoyed at Bush at various times , on the other hand we’re working more closely with Europe on Iran than we ever have before , and for all the talk about the US image in the world , the truth is , Barack Obama’s not going to change those policies much at all . </s>
And I think it’s good as an America , if we get a lot of credit now with Obama and people decide they like us better but the actual policies , the NATO policies , the Afghanistan policies , the Iran policies , the Pakistan-India policies , the China policies , are not going to change much . Because they’re sensible pollicies . On the economy , obviously that’s been terrible in the last few months , I do think Bush could’ve done some things differently but to be fair , it’s not as if the Democrats had one prescription and Bush had another , and we went down one road and that’s where we are . There were bipartisan mistakes , on some of the institutions like Fannie and Freddie . I’d say Bush was more correct than the Democrats , on others , he might’ve been somewhat less correct . </s>
We did have economic growth over these eight years , on the other hand , the big piece of deregulation that everyone loves to site as being the kind of key that unlocked the derivatives and the other instruments that have turned out to be , that spiraled out of control , the key that unlocked that was presumably the 1999 deregulation of financial institutions signed by Bill Clinton . Bush didn’t sign any big deregulatory bill . So he gets a bit of a bum rap on the economy but , I won’t , I won’t make that my leading argument , for why Bush was a successful President , but the prescription drug benefit has worked very well . </s>
It has preserved competition while coming in under budget and helped a lot of seniors , aid for Africa has worked well , Bush has fought for free trade against a Democratic Party that has tried to turn its back on free trade and would…hopefully Obama will follow Bush and not some of his fellow Democrats in that way . The proof is in the pudding . </s>
Obama is not going to change many Bush policies . So it’s a little ridiculous to say , Bush is the worst President in 50 years , Barack Obama’s an intelligent , impressive man . </s>
He promises change , I hope he brings some change . </s>
But the fact of the matter is , Obama’s Presidency will be in most major respects , a continuation of the Bush Presidency , and that’s a good thing for the country . Thank you , Bill Kristol . Simon Jenkins is a journalist and an author and writes a column for The Guardian , he is a British subject , he is a friend of America , but has never hesitated to tell America when he thinks it has made mistakes , ladies and gentlemen , Simon Jenkins , arguing for the motion . Well ladies and gentlemen , I just heard a wonderful suggestion , Barack Obama is going to be the second-worst President since the war . </s>
The only thing I think that might make you , or many of you at least , not agree that George Bush is the worst American President of 50 years , is to hear somebody say it in a British accent . I’m acutely aware of the sensitivity of international comment . I am a deep skeptic about my own government , and I will not say much good of Gordon Brown , I won’t say a lot of good about hereditary monarchy . </s>
But if I hear someone with an American accent insult my Queen I’ll hit them . There is something about foreign accents on these subjects , that gets people’s backs up , so I beg your pardon . </s>
The point I want to make is this . That there are really two American Presidents . There’s a President of the United States of America , and that is entirely your business . </s>
But there’s a second American President . And he is the President of the Western Alliance , and in many senses since the end of the Cold War , is seen as a sort of President of the rest of the world . </s>
I’ve just been in Syria and Lebanon . A lady speaking at a meeting made a rather moving remark . She said every single one of us round the world , went to the polls on November the 4th , but only some of us were let in . The vast majority disenfranchised , sat outside , while America decided on their economy , on their diplomacy , on their politics , in many cases on their lives . And it’s to that American President that I want to say a few words tonight . </s>
I’ve spent almost all my life cheerleading for America . I’m second to nobody in this noble cause . And I can tell you it’s not been easy this past eight years . </s>
But until the last eight years , I have always felt , that each American President , in some small sense , pushed uphill the great boulder of democratic freedom . Every single one , I felt at the end of it , yeah , America’s done it again . We’ve made a bit of progress . I felt that was one of the great strengths of America , that it could push that boulder a bit uphill . It may have been a military intervention , it may have been a trade agreement , may have been a single example . </s>
Whatever it was , somehow or other , there was progress forward with what I call the great American crusade . When George Bush came to power I was rather in favor of him . </s>
I rather admired the program he put forth with this foreign policy . </s>
Condoleezza Rice’s famous article on a humble foreign policy , definitely appealed to me . I liked the remark about America setting the world an example by what it did at home , rather than by getting the 82nd Airborne to lead kids to school . This seemed to me to be a refreshing , unbombastic , unostentatious diplomacy . Then came 9-11 . And I’ve always remembered those few weeks after 9-11 , when the whole world was pro-American . </s>
Yasir Arafat gave blood for New Yorkers . Many people forget that . Almost nobody , almost nobody , was not on America’s side for those two or three weeks . And the disaster that followed , going to war in…true retaliation for it , is something from which I don’t think American policy has ever recovered . </s>
I’ve recently been touring around that arc of instability , and the consequences of the consequences of 9-11 really have been catastrophic . To pretend that Iraq is a success is obscene . Iraq today is more or less back to what it was like in 2004 and if Karl or Bill want to walk hand in hand with me down Haifa Street in Baghdad , as you could still in 2004 , well , I can tell you they won’t . Afghanistan is heading in exactly the same direction , I think Afghanistan’s going to be a far worse mistake than Iraq . </s>
But in every single theater that you look , with the possible exception of Japan which had been eccentrically mentioned , you will see what I can only describe as the wrong decisions taken . Iran should not be a at the moment , it should much more like Egypt , and it could’ve been . </s>
There’s no reason for undermining the Pakistan government to the extent it has been undermined by American military intervention there . Russia , a putative friend eight years ago , is now a serious menace . Wherever you look , you see what I call the crashes down the road of neoconservatism , littering the highway of world affairs . This was unnecessary , it was not required by circumstance , it was choice , it was decisions made in Washington . </s>
Now those of us who feel very strongly about America , always regarded the basis on which America operated out of its area , America went abroad to do things , was that it had a sort of moral superiority . There was behind what it did , a backbone . </s>
And that backbone was the backbone on which those people who approved of American intervention abroad always relied on . </s>
I’m afraid under the leadership of the last eight years , that backbone has snapped . It has been simply impossible to tell countries elsewhere in the world that the American example , that the American intention , that the American execution of its intervention has been for the best . </s>
People just don’t see it that way . If you go round many of these countries today , and I mean today , you see the most extraordinary faith put in the next American President— </s>
Simon , could you repeat that line because we wan na not edit the bell and… If you go round the world today , you will find the most extraordinary faith in the person you’ve elected as your next President . I have never come across anything like it . </s>
A totally naïve belief , that this is the messiah , Barack Obama , has come to save not you , but everybody . He will solve the Middle East . He will get out of Iraq , he’ll get out of Afghanistan , he’ll pacify Pakistan , he’ll make friends with Iran . </s>
Ludicrous expectations are placed on the shoulders of this man . The reason why that’s happened is because people simply have despaired over the last eight years . The reason why , I think , unrealistic but possibly disastrous expectations are made of Barack Obama , is that , George Bush , for better or for worse , George Bush , has caused such a catastrophe in so many countries around the world . </s>
I congratulate you on voting for Obama , I hope you will vote for this motion , thank you . </s>
Thank you , Simon Jenkins . </s>
Karl Rove has been a member of President Bush’s political family since President Bush first decided to go into politics . It goes back more than two decades . </s>
He is known as the architect of the 2000 and 2004 victories . </s>
The President has referred to him as “The Boy Wonder.” Ladies and gentleman , Karl Rove . Thank you , John . Thanks to Intelligence Squared for having me here tonight . Simon , I know what you mean about the problem with foreign accents . </s>
And I noticed it did n't take you all long to vote , did it . I 'm going to make an appeal to the open minded people of the upper west side . And for those of you sensitive to sulfur and brimstone , I apologize , nothing I can do about it . I’d like to spend my time talking about the drive-by’s we just saw . Let’s start with education . </s>
We say a drive-by on No Child Left Behind . Sure , we said states should set standards . </s>
We did n't set one national standard , because we wanted the people in New York and the people in New Mexico to be engaged in setting standards for their states , and to be involved in setting up a system that they would buy into . And in the five years since No Child Left Behind has come into force around this country , which requires every state to set standards , and to test every child grades three through eight to find out if the children are meeting the standards for reading , writing , and other material , we have seen more improvement in reading and math and science scores in those five years than we’ve seen in the twenty-eight previous years combined . And the scores have gone up most… The scores have gone up most among minority communities , black and brown and poor and rural . We heard about immigration , with a , a line that said , somehow or other the President threw in with the immigration restrictions . You know what , I don’t think that bill we brought to the floor of the United States Senate was an immigration restrictions bill . </s>
It was a bill that resolved the problem in a comprehensive way , and the President showed courage by standing for it and making it possible . PEPFAR . </s>
I heard a dismissal of this incredible effort , by the generosity of the American people , that is today providing over two million people in Africa with life saving retroviral drugs . Now sure , we insist upon encouraging programs to have to educate people about abstinence and faithfulness within marriage , and how those can help break the cycle of the spread of AIDS . And it’s working . And free trade , I love this one , I love this one . I sat there and was part of the team that bled to win trade promotion authority , and you know how many votes we won it by ? </s>
One . We got CAFTA , which was a no-brainer , should have been a no- brainer . You know how many votes we got it by ? </s>
One . </s>
I sat there in that room , in the cabinet room with twenty-two Democrats who voted for NAFTA , and China , and TPA under Clinton , who could not bring themselves to vote for free trade under this President . Why ? Politics . So , I appreciate the enthusiasm that some of our adversaries here at tonight’s debate have for free trade , and I 'm looking forward to working with them in common cause on behalf of every free trade measure that comes before the United States Congress . </s>
And why don’t we make a pact that we’ll start with Columbia ? Why don’t we do that . Now , about that invasion of Iraq , I appreciated hearing about how it was done on a false premise , and hearing those words come from the mouth of somebody who wrote eloquently about the need to remove Saddam Hussein from power , I appreciate your support at the time . Nice of you to flip flop now . Easy to flip flop now . </s>
Look , do we wish we had the , that the weapons were there ? And it was justified under those terms ? </s>
Yeah . You know what ? </s>
Smart people , like Bill Clinton and Al Gore and John Kerry and our new Secretary of State designate sat on the floor of the Congress or at the White House in the nineties , or in the Congress in the 2000’s and said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction . And we now know that there was a reason why he did n't have them , but he wanted us to think he had them . </s>
He told his interrogators he felt it made him look big in the neighborhood , and he , and we know from two reports by , by Kay and Duefler , that Saddam Hussein was intent upon recreating these programs the moment the West lost its interest in him . So he literally siphoned tens of millions of dollars out of the Food for Peace Program to do two things , to keep together the engineers and the scientists and the technicians to reconstitute these programs , and to keep the dual use facilities to rapidly reconstitute particularly the chemical and biological programs . Now , I loved also being lectured about sabotaging unity after 9/11 . I sat there in those meetings on Homeland Security , where we had a great consensus about the need to defend the homeland by reorganizing our government , and the Democrats insisted on one thing , that the Department of Homeland Security should not be subject to the same constrictors regarding union membership that John F. Kennedy put in place for the rest of the government in 1961 , and that Jimmy Carter signed into law in 1979 . They wanted the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Transportation to be governed by strictures that said , in a time of national security , certain elements of the agency could be declared off limits for union organizing , but they did n't want that same rule to apply to one department in the government , The Department of Homeland Security . </s>
Because they saw it as a sop for their union allies . That was not national unity in the aftermath of 9/11 , and it was an absence of national unity , because there were Democrats in the Congress who never accepted the legitimacy of this President . Talk about the mismanagement of the economy . Let’s talk about it . The Dow down thirty-eight percent , the NASDAQ down seventy-eight percent . </s>
The S & P down fifty percent . Six trillion dollars lost in value in one year . </s>
I 'm not talking about today , I 'm talking about March 2000 , when the markets started to go down and bottomed out in October of 2002 . Thank God this President had the wherewithal and the political capital and the moxie to pass a large effective stimulus package of one point six trillion dollars over ten years that got the economy growing again by long lasting tax cuts that benefited everybody in America who pays taxes . Even the critic Ray Fair at Yale , who forecast that in 2000 his model said George Bush would get thirty-four percent of the vote , he was just a little bit off , said that without this one out of every twenty American workers who were employed in 2001 and 2002 would not have been employed were it not for the tax cuts . Now , we’ve heard some other things , Fannie , and we’ve heard about Yassir Arafat , giving blood in the aftermath of 9/11 . Well , as long as America wasn’t going to throw over Israel as our ally and friend , that was going to be a temporary act of friendship , and an enduring life of hate . </s>
And Iran , it’s somehow our fault , Bush’s fault , that the Ayatollah’s , and the Mullah’s , and the lunatics are pursuing a nuclear weapon in Iran ? </s>
I think that has to do with their decision to pursue a nuclear weapon , not us making them do it . Karl , you’ve got thirty seconds . And Pakistan ? </s>
I loved it , being lectured about undermining the government of Pakistan . After all , have n't we just elected a President who promised to invade Pakistan if it did n't comply with America’s wishes ? Now look , I will defend the President , and I will defend the record of the last eight years . Not always successful , but enormously successful over the long term and the long sweep of history . Karl Rove , thank you very much . </s>
Thank you for having me here tonight . </s>
Thank you , Karl Rove . And that concludes the opening statements . </s>
In a minute or two we’re going to come to you , the audience , again , reminding you to keep your questions focused and brief and have a question mark at the end of it . But we now have the numbers that tell us your opinions as you came off the street tonight . On our motion that George W. Bush is the worst president of the last fifty years , that Bush 43 is the worst president of the last fifty years , sixty-five percent of you are for the motion , seventeen percent against , and eighteen percent undecided . </s>
And again , as we said at the beginning , we tend to judge success in this debate by how much you can actually move those numbers . So , if that sixty-five percent goes up , the side for will have prevailed , if the seventeen percent that is against goes up , that side will be seen to have prevailed . Anyone ready with questions just yet ? Yes ? Lady standing here . </s>
You can sit if you’d like to , it’s up to you . This is a question for any member of the panel . What president in the last fifty years has faced the challenges that Bush 43 has faced ? </s>
Very good , and very sharp and focused question . Bill Kristol . Every president faces challenges , and obviously each different . But I think if you 're implying that Bush faced particularly stark challenges , with a plummeting economy as he took over , and then of course 9/11 , for which the government wasn’t prepared , the country wasn’t prepared , the Bush administration frankly wasn’t prepared , but certainly the Clinton administration had n't done much to help prepare for , I think the President reacted well to the challenges he faced . And that is what makes someone a reasonably successful president . </s>
He made mistakes , as he said recently in the interview . You know , he wasn’t , he had n't realized he was going to have to fight two wars , no one thought we would do that , be doing that in October of 2000 . He adjusted in the conduct of those wars , I think pretty well , and the same with Homeland Security , they made a couple of mistakes , but basically ended up , thank God , I think , hardening this country in a pretty effective way , and putting al Qaeda on the run by taking the offensive . I really don’t understand this , I mean , Pakistan , poor Bush , he gets criticized not promoting democracy in Pakistan enough . </s>
Then we promote democracy in Pakistan , we have elections , we actually have a rather good leader of Pakistan , now he has a corrupt past , but has said the right things about trying to curb… Well , you can laugh about it , but it’s a tough place to govern . He’s trying to curb the ISI and the terrorists . </s>
We’re now going in aggressively in the northwest frontier to take out al Qaeda . I don’t think that’s a mistake . I think Obama is right to support Bush on that . </s>
So , I think Bush adjusted well to very difficult circumstances . Jacob Weisberg , the implication of that question is that no president could have done well with these circumstances . What do you think of that ? </s>
Well I disagree with that . Every president until , through Bush’s father , had to manage the Cold War which was infinitely more threatening to the existence of civilization than September 11th was . And in particular , if you want a particularly specific example , John F. Kennedy and the Cuban Missile Crisis , which probably brought us closer to Armageddon than we’ve ever been . And the way Kennedy personally managed that crisis , if you’ve ever seen the movie Thirteen Days , or listened to any of the tapes , is an amazing story , because he rejected the advice of very powerful people in his administration who claimed to know a lot more than he did . But his instincts were very good , and he made the decision that saved us all . </s>
Audience questions . </s>
I 'm going to collect a couple . To the right here , and then I want to get to the other side , I see a white sleeve halfway up , keep that hand waving and we’ll get a microphone to you . </s>
Thank you . This is a question for Mr. Rove . </s>
I have great belief in the wisdom of the gross American population . If what you have said about the Bush successes is true , how is it that his general , approval record is so extraordinarily and historically low . </s>
OK , I 'm going to hold that question , Karl , and collect a couple of others . But we will come to it . The gentleman with the white sleeve we spoke of ? This is also a question for Mr. Rove . </s>
If the United States is known for its Constitution and for respect for the rule of law , how would you rate the Bush presidency ? And as a follow-up question , why would you not testify in a criminal investigation related to abuse of government power ? </s>
Thank you . </s>
All right . </s>
We’re going to take these two questions . Now , these questions are to Karl , but I see an opening a truck could drive through for your opponents to also be part of this conversation . Karl , the first question , why are the President’s approval ratings so low ? Yeah , well look , we’re asking , it’s an unpopular war , and we’re asking the country to do tough things for a long time . And the economy’s bad . </s>
I would remind you , not to correct Mr. Weisberg , but there have been three presidents who have had lower approval ratings that I 'm aware of , Carter , well actually four , Carter , Nixon , Johnson , and Truman . Truman left office with numbers lower than this President’s . History has judged each of these men differently after their departure . If I could respond to the second one , rule of law . First of all , I 'm not aware that I’ve refused to testify in a criminal investigation . </s>
You may know something I don’t know . You want to elucidate ? </s>
I think what you may be suggesting is why will I not testify in front of the United States Congress ? And the reason is because I believe in the rule of law . The rule of law that says there’s a separation of powers between the executive and the legislative branches , and that the President of the United States has a right to receive confidential advice form his assistants , which has been upheld by the United States Supreme Court . </s>
Now , right now it’s being re- litigated again , because the United States Senate did not like the answer the White House gave them in the summer of July , in the summer of 2007 . </s>
If I 'm called upon , and a court of law says that the President has no such right , I’ll testify . In the House of Representatives and in the Senate , we have made numerous attempts to provide the Congress with the information that it’s requested , in a way that protects the right of a President and his prerogative to receive that kind of advice from his staff , from his confidential advisors . The Senate has refused to take any one of the options . </s>
The House refused to take five separate options that we gave them , until finally , some members of the House Judiciary Committee asked the questions that were being asked by the Committee , and sent them to me . And under penalty , I responded to those , and if you like , you can find my answers at Rove.com . So , I’ve answered them . But , there is a rule of law , and we ought to respect that rule of law that says there is a separation of powers between the branches , and that’s exactly why I’ve been directed by the President not to testify in front of Congress on these issues . Simon Jenkins , I want to bring you into the conversation . </s>
We , the issue , that question was premised on the notion that America’s image has always rested on its adherence to the rule of law , and that the years of the Bush administration have , to some degree , to seem to have been a disintegration of the value of the Constitution . With Barack Obama now taking over , does the fact that he has this terrible image with which to compare himself , give him a boost , or does the fact that American leadership have been so diminished , respect for America has been so diminished , give him a terrible starting point ? Well , I think the origin of this whole part of the discussion is the response to 9/11 . 9/11 is the starting point of almost everything that we’ve been talking about . And I think many people in Europe , and around the world , simply feel that America over- reacted , and so did Britain , I may say . </s>
So , this is not something peculiar to America . It was a feeling that some new force had been unleashed on the world to which we had to respond by restricting our normal customary defenses and liberty . </s>
I 'm a libertarian , and I feel that was , I’ve always felt that was simply unnecessary , the reaction was an overreaction . The consequence of it , however , is that we have , in a sense , played the terrorist’s game . We’ve done what they wanted us to do , which was restrict our liberties , curb our liberties , behave in a certain way towards other States and other peoples that we would not normally have done before . And— But I heard Bill Kristol saying , and Bill , let me bring you into this , I’ve heard you say that , when it comes to terrorism , rather than playing the terrorist’s game , that the President has succeeded in putting the terrorists on the run , which is why 9/11 was the only incident in this city . </s>
Would that they were on the run . Bill Kristol . Well , they have n't been very successful here , and they have n't been very successful in Western Europe , and they’ve actually not been very successful elsewhere . Al Qaeda has been a losing proposition for the last several years . It remains a huge problem of , a jihadist impulse in the Islamic world , which is , unfortunately , abetted by certain states . </s>
But I think Bush has done a pretty good , well , a very good job of making terror a losing proposition , which is the most important thing he could have done , taken away their momentum , which again , if we had not gone into Iraq , and if we had lost in Iraq , that would have been the single most disastrous result . </s>
Bush turned that around . </s>
But I just don’t buy this premise that we’ve radically curved civil liberties . Bush has done less after the 9/11 attack than any other President has done , much , much less , he’s much more responsible than Franklin Roosevelt was after we were attacked in World War II . He’s been much more solicitous of civil liberties than , if I might say , John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson were during , and Richard Nixon were , during Vietnam . </s>
We’ve had , you know , some controversial calls , and some tough calls . </s>
There were a couple of over-reactions which the Bush administration itself walked back , Jack Goldsmith and Attorney General Mukasey have , I think , corrected some controversial interpretations that probably went too far— Bill , can I interrupt you— </s>
Yeah . One second— </s>
Jacob Weisberg . Jack Goldsmith was drummed out of the Bush administration for challenging those decisions— </s>
That 's not true . He was not— </s>
They , he changed the actual Office of Legal Counsel policy , and Attorney General Mukasey is leaving the Bush legal program intact , and I— But if you— </s>
It’s totally defensible , and it will not be changed much by Barack Obama . If you read Goldsmith’s book he was driven out , more or less . But the point is you -- I 'm amazed by -- I appreciate how open minded you are about some of these issues . </s>
But on the civil liberties issues , you 're amazingly cavalier . </s>
Closing Guantanamo is no big deal , we have them here , we have them there . Torture , you wo n't second guess the decisions . </s>
I mean , these go to the heart of the questions about the rule of law and the Constitution , and the question of whether terror suspects… OK , well what is the question ? The question— Bush— The question— </s>
Bush has lost fewer court decisions than almost any president has . He lost two five to four decisions . You can , maybe the five were right , maybe Bush should n't have gone quite as far as he did in some of the claims he made about Guantanamo . </s>
But we are going to have to detain people . We are not going to be able to provide them all civil trials . </s>
I do not believe that is a way you can deal with terrorists captured on the battlefield . Why ca n't you deal with them with military trials ? We have an existing— We are , he set up a system of military trials— No , he set up his own alternate system . </s>
We already had a system of military justice— He signed legislation— </s>
He decided he needed his own— …that Congress passed . </s>
He signed legislation that Congress passed in 2005 and 2006 . </s>
Karl Rove , let’s bring in Karl Rove . And I just want to say , it’s fine to register your reaction to this with applause . I heard it for Jacob , I have n't heard it for Bill Kristol . </s>
I mean , is there a sense of support for , for Bill Kristol’s argument ? No , no , no… Karl Rove ? Don’t , don’t be doing that again , John , we’ve lost sixty- five/seventeen . Come on , man . </s>
I’m delighted that we did better than the Upper West Side— I was trying to get the seventeen to applaud here . You know , we got eight percent of the vote in one of the precincts up here , I mean , come on , man ! Come on ! </s>
All right , look , it’s clever to suggest that we ought to have the military , the style of courtroom justice we provide to our military , and provide that for enemy non-combatants , I mean enemy combatants . We should n't . </s>
That’s what we attempted to do in the military justice system , is to the greatest possible degree possible duplicate our civil justice system . And are you suggesting that we ought to Mirandize these people and keep a chain of evidence and all the other things that we normally do in both military and civilian courts for terrorists ? </s>
Not at all , and people have far fewer rights under the military system . But the point is , under your system , they have no rights . The prisoners at Guantanamo were originally denied access to a lawyer , we could n't even find out who was there , and the original claim by the Bush administration was that this applied to citizens as well as non-citizens . So , if the Bush administration decided that you were suspected of terrorism , you could be held indefinitely without a lawyer , without a hearing , without a trial . </s>
You know what— I 'm not saying that these— </s>
With all due respect , you 're making it sound like everybody on the Upper West Side needs to worry about being sent to the reeducation camps in Texas . And in reality what it was focused at is , if we picked up a US Citizen who was a terrorist on a battlefield abroad , would we subject him to US law , or would we treat them as a terrorist— But here’s what you slipped in , if we picked up someone who’s a terrorist . </s>
What if they happen not to be a terrorist ? Some of these people have been acquitted . And the system has a process of review in which that determination can be made . Anyway , the big picture , look , the fact is in the big picture— Name one guy you 're worried about— </s>
Let’s take it to Bill Kristol . Name one guy you 're worried about . No , that 's exactly right . You 're worried about John , John Lindh ? You 're worried about him ? </s>
I 'm , I'm— I mean , what person are you worried about ? Was the Bush administration bad at explaining their policies , especially abroad ? </s>
Yes . </s>
Did people abroad take a kind of cavalier and really , hypocritical sense of pleasure in decrying those ridiculous Americans with all this stuff ? While they themselves , of course , as you know well , in Continental Europe , treat their own citizens with many less rights , are much , much nastier to their minorities , Bush went out of his way , and with great success , to say this is not a war on Islam , we need to protect everybody’s rights , he was incredibly solicitous , as he should have been of Muslim-Americans , Muslim-Americans here have a much fairer and more equal playing field than Muslims do in most of these wonderful European countries that sit around having heart attacks about two hundred people held at Guantanamo… Simon , let’s— </s>
And let’s just talk , Bush made two Supreme Court appointments , they were incredibly highly qualified . </s>
Alito , sixty-one appointments to Federal courts . Whatever , they were conservative , of course , as Obama’s will be liberal , extremely highly qualified judges . He made a couple of mistakes , I think , in his appointments , out of excessive loyalty , perhaps with Alberto Gonzales , but the fact is , Ashcroft was a serious Attorney General , and then he brought in Mukasey , and he’s leaving an intact and functioning legal system which we can be proud of given the threats we’re facing . </s>
Simon Jenkins ? What I think is extraordinary to people abroad , is that those of us who are enthusiasts for America and American liberties can not see why you needed to do these things . You will never persuade the outside world that you have not restricted liberty in America . You will never persuade them that you have not taken out Muslims as a particular group , and you will never , and you never persuade them that you really needed to do these things . </s>
What things ? Because— What have we done to Muslims in America ? What has happened ? </s>
Arrested them . We’ve arrested Muslims in America ? Incarcerated them without trial . We’ve incarcerated— </s>
Rounded them up ? </s>
…Muslims in America without trial ? Rounded , rounded them up ? Name one ? Nonsense . </s>
Name one instance . The , belabor me all day with lists of people who have vanished . Vanished . You know— </s>
Well , that— This is on the border of lunacy , with all due respect . But you did n't need to do it , you did n't need to do it— </s>
We did n't do it ! All right , let’s come back to some questions . Hang on , hang on here . You did n't need Guantanamo Bay . I see down in , down in the front row , there— </s>
You’ve got the world believing America is a less robust place , and it really is . Now , what part of the world is that ? Is that— </s>
You— …China and India ? Do they have… I 'm serious . </s>
No . </s>
Let’s talk about “the world.” Yeah , yeah . The world turns out to be a certain class of liberal elites in Western Europe . Not all of Western… It does , it does ! Is Bush… Is America unpopular ? </s>
Has anyone here been , is America unpopular in East Asia ? </s>
Is America unpopular , has Bush’s policy towards China been terrible in terms of Chinese views ? Have we had a , India is a great success story , a rather important , huge democracy , for Bush . Even in Western Europe , when Bush took over , there were rather anti-American prime ministers , democratically elected obviously , in France and in Germany— </s>
It’s just not true . Or at least skeptical of America . Then Merkel wins in Germany , and Sarkozy wins in France . </s>
If they 're so , if America’s image is so ruined , if they just ca n't stand America , why did they elect the more pro-American candidate in both of those races ? I want to go to questions . First row ? </s>
And you know I don’t want to be biased against folks in the back just because I ca n't see them , if you can be a little horizontal . Ah ! All the way in the rear , blue shirt ? I want to collect your question in the front row , and then you’ll be— Well , I hate to disrupt that exchange , but question for Mr. Rove and Mr. Kristol , who is the worst President of the last fifty years and why ? </s>
One second . Let’s see what we have in the back . The statement has been made that we have been made safer since , because of President Bush’s administration since September 11th . If he is to receive credit , is he to receive blame for not protecting us from September 11th ? OK , I want to take a third one from about eight rows up , and three rows , three seats over . </s>
Question for misters Kristol and Rove . In the last fifty years this administration has been by far the biggest spending administration with the possible exception of Lyndon Johnson . Can , sir , can we ask you to start the question again ? Thank— In the last fifty years , this administration has been by far the biggest spending administration with the possible exception of Lyndon Johnson , and that’s even before spending on Homeland Security and Iraq . </s>
What is your response to that . OK , I want to go to the second question first . On the question of September 11th , does President Bush deserve any blame for September 11th ? </s>
We published in the Weekly Standard of , in July of 2001 an article by Reuel Marc Gerecht , who I think has participated in these debates , alarmed that we were not doing enough to fight al Qaeda , that they had bombed the USS Cole in October of 2000 , and that neither the Bush administration , nor the Congress , the Democrats , Republicans , really understood how serious the threat of al Qaeda was . </s>
I think the Bush administration would say , I mean , I think Conde Rice and others have said this , that they now wish , of course , they had been more alarmed and more alert as they had taken office in those first few months . So yes , there is blame to go around on 9/11 . But fundamentally , the growth of al Qaeda , the ability of al Qaeda , which was key to have the terror training camps unmolested in Afghanistan , is not something that primarily happened under Bush . Can we just , one more word on this , because if you read Richard Clarke’s book , or some of the other inside accounts of this , it’s clear , it’s not that nobody had heard of al Qaeda , Richard Clarke , for example , was running around with his hair on fire about how dangerous this threat was . And it’s clear that Bush , in the early days , downplayed it , rejected it , did n't take it seriously , and did so because it had been a particular focus of the Clinton administration , and he was reversing policy . </s>
The focus… ? If it was such a focus of the Clinton Administration , it would be nice to know what they did about it , since— </s>
Well they… </s>
Richard Clarke himself— They launched missile strikes— </s>
Well , they launched one series— …on Osama bin Laden— One series of— They missed . </s>
Bush hasn’t got him either . They started a little later . </s>
Anyway… A question you were asked , who is the worst President of the last fifty years ? </s>
Look , I mean this is a , you know , this is why this question is a little artificial . I mean , Lyndon Johnson probably made the worst mistake , perhaps , of the last fifty years , with Vietnam , but he also deserves a huge amount of credit , I think , and I’ll say this as a conservative and a Republican , some of what he did in terms of , certainly , civil rights , and I would say something like Medicare . So , people are not , you know , univocally good or bad . </s>
I do think , at the same time , personal , corruption of the political system for political , of the judicial system , and of the governmental system for political ends , clearly Nixon . And I would say in terms of just incompetence and leaving the country in dangerous shape which had to be reversed , Carter . So , the seventies was a bad decade , in my opinion , for American presidents , and for America , and for the world . Which was reversed by Reagan . </s>
Karl Rove , we had a questioner say that President Bush was a big spender . Yeah , look , I like how first of all you did put , say put aside Homeland Security . Let’s take a look at discretionary domestic spending . The last budget left to us , the FY ’01 budget , left to us by that previous President whose name you can fill in , increased discretionary domestic spending in FY ’01 fifteen percent in one year . </s>
That means that would double the discretionary spending of the Federal government , if left at that rate , in five and a half years . We cut , in our first budget , FY ’02 , discretionary domestic spending to seven percent , in FY ’03 to four percent , in FY ’04 , excuse me , FY ’05 , two percent , and six , seven , and eight , have flat lined discretionary domestic spending of the government . Been hard to do . We’re going to leave a big , we’re going to leave an enormous benefit in place for Barack Obama in that we have flat lined discretionary domestic spending . And the biggest , and the biggest spending item is , are two things , the tax cuts , we can debate economic policy , but I think an awful lot of people think especially 2003 tax cuts were sensible and ended up producing , actually , a lot of revenue . </s>
And prescription drug benefit , which I would defend as a conservative . Medicare exists , it is a pretty good program , it had to be improved , it had to be updated by bringing prescription drugs into it . It’s come in under budget , and I think , what , ninety-two percent of seniors are covered , and it seems to be working pretty well . </s>
Now , if you 're a strict , small government libertarian conservative , you would object to Bush starting a new entitlement program , and that’s a defensible , philosophical position , but in that case , the biggest domestic expenditure , the biggest piece of domestic legislation of the Bush administration , it did what Bush said it was going to do . I 'm collecting questions again , from the upper left where the camera is . John , could I add a little bit of that to , to— I want to move on , Karl , because your colleague covered it quite well . He did . </s>
Yes , sir ? Hello , my question is for mister… Your , I think your mic might have cut out , at least it did to the hall here . </s>
Can you try again ? …Jenkins…Weisberg . </s>
Before 9/11 terrorism was viewed as a criminal act , let’s investigate , let’s get the bad guys . </s>
In my opinion— Sir , I apologize because we’ve got the camera with you , and the mic is malfunctioning , and another one is on its way to you . While that’s happening , I 'm going to go to a question down front row center . </s>
Yes , for Mr. Rove . </s>
Had the— </s>
Wait , I 'm sorry , do you need the shot ? You 're good ? OK . Mister— I 'm sorry , we , we’re not quite ready . </s>
OK . </s>
We ca n't hear you also . OK . </s>
Try again . Had the— I just want to ask our broadcast side if they heard that , because I know I did n't . All right . </s>
Here it comes . The question is for Mr. Rove . Had the intelligence been accurate prior to the invasion of Iraq , would the invasion have still taken place , in your view ? No . </s>
In the aftermath of 9/11 the concern was about a tyrant guilty of enormous human rights abuses , but possessed with weapons of mass destruction and an intention to use them as a state sponsor of terror . Absent that , I suspect the administration’s course would have been to work to find more creative ways to constrain him than he’d been constrained in the nineties . The President did have an enormous concern about the human rights abuses under Saddam Hussein . </s>
He also had a concern about the deterioration of the credibility of the United Nations , which had passed sixteen resolutions calling upon him to abide by the outcome and the agreements that he made in the aftermath of the ’91 , of the first Gulf War , that he’d not lived up to . But absent weapons of mass destruction , no , I don’t think there would have been an invasion . </s>
OK , are we set for the question up in the corner up here yet ? And otherwise I’ll come up the aisle , if you can come up the aisle , red sweater . Let’s wait till the camera reaches you . Very good , very patient . Thank you . </s>
My question is for Mr. Rove . What is the future of the party ? </s>
Specifically in terms of diversifying the party ? As we’ve seen , that was the biggest issue next to the economy . </s>
Can you please talk on that issue . OK , let’s hold that question and collect a couple more , just because we’re having this microphone problem . </s>
The young lady of two rows down , eyeglasses . This is for Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Weisberg . You’ve criticized President Bush for going to war with Iraq . If President Bush had not decided to go to war with Iraq and had only decided to go to war with Afghanistan to fight terrorism , do you think Saddam Hussein would have , A , remained a neutral and impartial observer in the war between Islamic terrorists and the West ; B , allied with the United States in an effort to stamp out Islamic terrorists and bring democracy to Afghanistan ; or C , grown a dangerous supporter and protector of Islamic terrorists , including al Qaeda and others . </s>
Simon and Jacob , why don’t you take that . We have a problem here . I just don’t see terrorism as a state projected force in the way that you do . I regard it in the sense that the question was trying to ask before , as a criminal act of gangsters roaming the world , and badly in need of curtailing by their own governments . I think the way we treated international terrorism is to glorify it , to give it the status of a state . </s>
We’ve given huge recruiting energy to those people who want to bring young people into this particular odious fold , and I think by declaring war on some governments , I may say not all governments that harbor them , we’ve accorded them a status wholly beyond what they deserve . I believe that my country and your country’s overstated this threat . I just think we’ve overdone it . And in overdoing it , we turned very large numbers of countries in the , particularly in the Islamic world , into state menaces . They themselves are undermined by the status we’ve given to these people . </s>
Pakistan being a classic case of that . This is quite a cosmic question . </s>
If you declare a very small group of people to be an international menace , you turn them into a sort of hero , and we’ve done that , and it’s been a terrible , terrible mistake . Jacob ? Mr. Rove mentioned somewhere in that incredible litany of distortions that… that I was in favor of getting rid of Saddam Hussein . </s>
I was , as were a lot of sensible people . I did n't happen to favor doing it the way Bush did , largely unilaterally , rejecting allies , as opposed to building pressure on Saddam , and not waiting for the inspection process to play out . But I think the point is , and what we’ve subsequently learned , and the problem I had that Bush did n't have , was I did not have access to analysts from the Department of Energy trying to tell everybody that those aluminum tubes were not for nuclear weapons . But the point is that Saddam was being , had been successfully disarmed , and was being successfully contained , and he was not supporting international terrorism , because he was afraid to . </s>
He was a miscalculator , a serial miscalculator , but he was not a mad man , and I think he understood very clearly that supporting terrorism against the United States would have resulted in the same thing that happened anyway , his destruction . I think what would have happened if we did n't invade Iran , I’d actually like to turn the question around a little bit and ask Bill Kristol , for example , does he , knowing what we know now , still think invading Iraq would make sense ? But I think that we might have ended up having to take military action against Saddam Hussein at some point in the future . </s>
But I think we could have done it with allies , I think we could have done it in a more thought out way , and I think we could have planned for an occupation , it could have been expected if we knew we were going to have to do it . </s>
Bill , I think that question to you was more than rhetorical , but I want you to take twenty seconds to answer it . I think Karl is right that we , that the President would not , in fact , have gone to war if he had known what seems to be the case , that Saddam had no real functioning weapons of mass destruction programs at the time . </s>
I , having said that , so I think as an analytical manner Karl’s certainly right , the American political system would n't have supported it . Now , I think it was right to go to war to remove Saddam . </s>
I think the Middle East would be incredibly much more dangerous if he were , or his sons were in power . I think every radical state and every radical group would be empowered , because weakness is what empowers them , and he would have stood , stood down , in effect , the US , and the UN , and the civilized world . It’s inconceivable we could have kept the sanctions up . </s>
They were already fraying . It’s inconceivable , the inspectors were only in because we moved a hundred and fifty thousand troops next door . They would have gone out , it would have been a horrible defeat for the West , and I think it would have , we would have had a much more resurgent radicalism in the Islamic world than we have today , where I think it’s a mixed bag , that actually in many respects the terrorist groups are on the defensive and on the run . </s>
Karl Rove , you had a question… You had a question , Karl Rove , about the future of the party particularly in its ability to be more diverse . Well , after a loss , every political party goes through a period of introspection and rebuilding , and Republicans have to do that this time . </s>
Let’s be clear , though , about what happened in this election , and that is that Barack Obama got three point one percent more than Al Gore got in 2000 . This is not the blow out that you might expect given the conditions of the economy and the unpopularity of the war . This was not a sixty/forty victory . </s>
He got fifty-three percent of the vote . He got seven point one million more votes than John Kerry got , and four out of every five were black or brown . And therein lies the challenge for the Republican party . The party of Lincoln needs to make a concerted appeal for African-American votes , knowing that in the short term it is going to pay off not one twit , and in the long run , it has a moral obligation as a great political party to represent all Americans . </s>
And it can only do that by making the case to African-Americans and Latinos . </s>
And Republicans have a similar problem brewing among Latinos . George Bush got forty-four percent of the vote among Latinos , John McCain , who was a courageous , early advocate of immigration reform , got thirty-one . We can not take the largest , fastest growing minority in America and write it off like we did with African-Americans . And then we also have a problem with the young , because let’s be candid , the war has turned young voters , eighteen to twenty-nine , against the war . They voted for Obama by two to one , and they not only were against the war , they 're against the Republicans . </s>
And those three Republicans have got to work on . But , on the other hand , Republicans had a victory , had a defeat this year that was not the blowout , and it was also the victory for Obama that was not as big as anticipated . I , take , for example , Ronald Reagan in 1980 , when he got elected , he brought in a hundred state senators with him , net , and three hundred members of state houses . </s>
This time around Barack Obama brought in a net of ten state senators , and ninety-four house members . This was an individual victory for a charismatic , articulate , inspiring individual , an historical figure , and the Democrats are going to make a mistake if they think this is some kind of gigantic swing toward their party . </s>
We’re heading down the home stretch from questions from the audience . Where the mic is positioned now , and the camera , and halfway up to the left , the red sleeve . I 'm sorry , because I 'm rather blinded by the lights , I 'm seeing the colors of sleeves . I’ll take you over there first . </s>
OK , as I tried to say before , my question is for mister Jenkins or Weisberg . </s>
Some will say that George W. Bush’s most difficult decision , and maybe most courageous , is to treat terror— …and not a criminal act . I ask you , we’ve had decades to judge these , please name me the difficult and courageous decisions made by Lyndon Baines Johnson and Jimmy Carter that have been proven to be the right ones , please . All right , and up here ? </s>
Mr. Jenkins , I watched Prime Minister’s questions on Wednesday morning . </s>
And the UK outlawed anchor babies as a way to curb illegal immigration . Do you think that would work here in America , and what does the panelists think ? I 'm going to , I 'm going to pass on that question , I 'm afraid , because it’s actually not on our topic tonight , with respect , but thank you very much . And I want to ask the cameraman to pivot to his right , and there’s a man in a blue shirt . To Simon and Jacob , how would you describe Bush’s prosecution of the Iraq War and his rationale for the Iraq War , versus the rationale and prosecution of the Vietnam War by JFK , LBJ , and Nixon— </s>
All right , it’s— And what differences do you see in how those two conflicts have been resolved ? It seems as though those two questions actually come together , so I 'm going to go for a third one , the gentleman whom I can see clearly in the bright light with his hand up . Hold on , one moment . OK . </s>
Just one simple question , first of all , thank you all for coming here . I 'm curious , if an aspect of the success of the Bush presidency is his foreign policy , and his defending us against the , terrorism , then how do you explain the fact that no one has caught Osama bin Laden at this point , the chief architect of the act that set all this off ? Karl Rove ? </s>
Because he is hiding in a deep , dark cave in a very dark corner of , in all likelihood , Pakistan . </s>
And , to suggest that not every effort has been made to get him is inaccurate . Every effort has been made to get him , to get at his communications , to get at his allies , to get at his subordinates , to get at his inner circle . A lot of them are dead…and we aren’t hearing much from him . And…but we got ta recognize we’re dealing with an odd part of the world , this is not as Simon alluded to , this is not a state . And it operates through states , the Taliban controlled a state , Afghanistan , that harbored and trained and gave succor to these terrorists . </s>
But they live in a odd and dark part of the world that is not a state , and it’s what makes destroying al-Qaeda’s leadership and our relationship with Pakistan both two very problematic things . Simon and Jacob , you had two questions along the lines of comparisons of George Bush to both Presidents Kennedy and Johnson , with I think the implication that , the President’s Iraq was their Vietnam , can you take on that question ? When I was a very young journalist , was in Vietnam at the very end of that war , and attended the relevant briefings , and this is not a—a very well-informed comment but , my view was that the Vietnam war and occupation of South Vietnam , was far more competently executed than the occupation of Iraq . The occupation of Iraq , was , and I followed American and British occupation troops around the world for most of my career—the occupation of Iraq was simply the most incompetent thing I’ve ever seen . It was stupefyingly incompetent… And I’ve no doubt at all that many people possibly on the platform wouldn’t disagree with that , because it was conducted by a very small group of people , against the advice of a much larger group of people within the administration . </s>
It simply has been a catastrophe . Afghanistan is much better conducted , although I think it’s a much more difficult war to fight . </s>
And that’s why I think it’s gon na end in greater tears than Iraq will end , Iraq is fairly simple to end , you just leave . It’ll be very , very difficult to leave Afghanistan . But certainly in Vietnam , I think you had on the whole relatively competent military people there , they had experience in Korea many of them . They lost but they only just lost . </s>
I do think that America could’ve stabilized South Vietnam had it stayed longer . It was not the right place to be and the right thing to do , but it was not a hopeless case . I think when you go into a country without a good reason , or with the purpose of simply punishing the country as was the case in both Iraq and Afghanistan , you’re not likely to do well , because you haven’t really plotted what the purpose of the exercise is , it was simply to punish . </s>
And I think it’s that punitive element that’s been the problem , certainly in Iraq . </s>
And I am sorry I’ve been there only twice , but I can not accept that it is in any sense of the word a success . </s>
Jacob ? Just on a— Sorry to step on your well-deserved applause , Simon . The… just on LBJ , the questioner asked what courageous thing did he ever do , just for starters , how about saying goodbye to the South for the Democratic Party for generations , when he signed the Civil Rights Act in ’64 and the Voting Rights Act in ’65 . Johnson knew that would be the political consequence of that decision and he did it anyway , to me that’s almost the definition of political courage . </s>
On judgement however I don’t think Johnson does so well in Vietnam and it’s quite comparable to Bush , I think— I think both of them were very poor—I think both of them were essentially unable to admit error , to recognize error , and to reverse error . And , whereas Johnson a slightly different story , and you know , you get into sort of psychological territory here but , Johnson clearly didn’t trust Kennedy’s advisors . He had this longstanding issue with the Kennedy brothers and I think he was getting some good advice from some of the Kennedy people , but I think he couldn’t hear it because of who was giving it . And likewise with Bush on Iraq , certainly the advice he got from Colin Powell at the very beginning not to invade Iraq was very good advice . But I think Bush was so blinded by his own motives , whatever you think they were , that I think he effectively couldn’t hear that . </s>
And then he couldn’t hear the very good advice that I said came from Bill Kristol , among other people that the strategy was failing and— You know , it finally took just a series , I mean it got to the point really where there was a total consensus that the strategy was failed , and that Rumsfeld was failing and I think Bush postponed change until there was absolutely no choice . Okay , we’re coming down to our last few minutes of questions and I would like to make it a little bit forward-looking and I just wan na see if any of the hands up here are—have questions related to what President-Elect Obama inherits from Bush , is anybody thinking along those lines quite clearly , and don’t snooker me because I’ll squash your question if it’s… Gentleman with the— Gentleman with the stubble . </s>
That’s what it is . I think we all know that this issue won’t really be decided here tonight but it very well may be in 12 years , in 16 years , in 20 years . For those against the motion , can you paint us a picture of the world that would make your case ? </s>
Yeah . </s>
Iraq as a functioning semi- democracy in the heart of the Middle East , as an example , that would be a powerful antidote to the terrorist image of what the future oughta be like . Afghanistan stabilized , a continued decline in the ability of terrorist elements like al-Qaeda to threaten the West . A continued diminution in their ability to recruit , which incidentally I think you may have seen or heard about the new report out which shows a dramatic decline in their operational capability and in their recruitment ability . And a world where the institutions that the President is seeking to leave in place , like PEPFAR and the Millennium Challenge have revolutionized and changed America’s pattern of foreign assistance to focus on results , and transparency and accountability . And new institutions whether it is the replacement for Kyoto with the G8 agreement this year to pursue a new international regime in which all the major emitters are at the table , and all the major emitters are focused on energy efficiency and technological advances that allow them to clean the air and reduce greenhouse gases , like we have done , we’re the only economy , the last year for which numbers are available are 2006 , there’s only one industrialized economy in the world that grows that year , and reduces the absolute level of greenhouse gases , it’s the United States of America because of the approach we’re pursuing . </s>
Great— </s>
That’s how it would look abroad . Let me just add to that and just , very briefly , make it a little sharper perhaps . Look , from 1979 on the Iranian revolution and the disastrous Saudi Wahhabi decision to compete with the Iranian revolution by exporting Wahhabi Islam much more aggressively abroad , enabled to do that by the , obviously oil revenues from the ‘70s , that they—once they were able to jack up oil prices in the ‘70s— jihadism , Islamic jihadism , Islamic extremism , terrorism has been unfortunately on the rise doing some damage to us and huge damage obviously , within the Islamic world and in the Middle East , and the greater Middle East and in South Asia . </s>
Successful Bush foreign policy , I mean , successful US foreign policy , which would have been begun by President Bush , 10 or 20 years from now , would’ve reversed that and I think we are on the cusp of reversing that . I think that is why the intervention in Iraq , the stabilizing of Iraq as a non- extremist , non-terror-friendly regime in the center of the Middle East , the crushing of al-Qaeda , and there’s some very difficult things to be done with Pakistan but at least so far maintaining some of the decent civilian government in Pakistan , while moving aggressively against the terror , parts of Pakistan that had been for quite a long time , terror-friendly , I mean that , reversing that would be incredibly important , that is really crucial to having a decent 21st century . And I think Bush has begun to reverse it , there’s much more that has to be done , I trust that President Obama will do it . </s>
And secondly nuclear weapons . </s>
It’s amazing that we have had as little proliferation of nuclear weapons as we’ve had . Many experts think over the last 50 years in retrospect the Pakistani explosion of nuclear weapons in ’98 , and I was no more prescient about this than anyone else , was a huge moment , a very dangerous moment , and what A. Q. Khan was doing , unbeknownst to us and , you know , to others , was unbelievably dangerous and made possible the North Korea program , it’s made possible the Iranian program , it accelerated the Iranian program . If we can prevent the spread of nuclear weapons , and that means preventing Iran from going nuclear , because if Iran goes nuclear are other nations in the Middle East going nuclear and we’re off to the races , then with a combination of nuclear weapons and possible terrorist and jihadist connections , it’s unbelievably dangerous , so I would say… Bush I think has done a pretty good job of beginning with that , I might’ve done a few things more hawkish than Bush actually , in terms of confronting Iran but , you know , he’s got the Europeans together for the first time with serious sanctions through the UN Security Council , the united front he’s handing Obama , to put as much pressure as possible on Iran , if he can turn around the negative momentum on nuclear proliferation and on Islamic jihadism , we will have a much safer world , if we can turn it around over the next 20 years , if all of us can turn it around around the world— if not we’re in a lotta trouble . I’m gon na turn one more time and , I wan na hear the question before we go to the panel , I’m really looking for something that talks about the legacy that President-Elect Obama inherits… We’ve had a question from you… Yes . </s>
I for one am proud of the job President Bush has done to keep us safe , and , in turn the world . With that said , Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Weisberg , you speak in theories , what would you suggest that Barack Obama now do with Islamo-fascism , its threat to the world , and how is that different from the current policies that the Bush administration is employing . Jacob . I think Obama should focus as he’s appropriately doing on Afghanistan and how to turn around a deteriorating situation there . I think he should figure out , how to get us out of Iraq without Iraq falling back into the situation it was in before the surge . </s>
I think those are com—things that are compatible , I think they’re possible . </s>
And , you know , much of this is so invisible to us that it’s very hard when we say Bush has kept us safe . It’s true , we have not had another terrorist attack in the United States . </s>
How much of that is the result of policy , how much is the result of accident . We don’t know that much about it , it’s the dog that didn’t bark . Would another President have handled it differently , I don’t think so . I think that it’s—it’s impossible to say . </s>
Simon Jenkins . I imagine the reason why there’ve been no more attacks in America or in Britain or in most of Europe , is because of good policing on the ground , not because you’ve been at war in the Middle East . I believe in good policing , I think the Kyoto terrorism , whatever that precisely may mean , people blowing people up , is essentially front-line policing . </s>
Good intelligence , good espionage , good work on the ground . It’s not by going to war against other states . But the phrase Islamo-fascism , so easily bandied about from this side of the Atlantic , and I may say from Europe , when you travel in these countries the relentlessness of the assumption that every Arab , every Muslim is a crypto-Islamo-fascist . </s>
And the evidence you give of it , by going in and invading some of their countries , is the surest possible way to turn them into hostile— I can not emphasize enough— As a follow-up to that— —these are normal people , by and large . They’re people quite like you . </s>
They don’t think , most of them , that they have a right to come and invade your country , close down Guantanamo Bay , do all the things they think you’re doing wrong . There is now an assumption on the part of both your country and my country under Tony Blair , that we have in some sense a right to go and sort out their countries , because they’re not like our countries . </s>
This must be one of the great fallacies of the modern age . I hope Obama overcomes it . Sir , did—did you get your answer ? Yes , I did . </s>
I didn’t ascribe the term Islamo— I’m sorry , I— —fascism to every— Can you start—can you begin again , please . I didn’t ascribe the term Islamo-fascism to everyone who’s a Muslim , or in that part of the world . </s>
I’m speaking about a specific group of people , who have no intent but to do all Westerners harm . </s>
You’ve taken it beyond that which is a great…liberal-elitist move to include everybody , but… To the answer to my question , how does Barack Obama , tackle it , what does he do different from the current policies to be effective . </s>
Well , I think that , good relations with a country , are more likely to get that country to suppress those elements within the country that are inclined to terrorism than bad relations with the country , that has to be true . I myself , I myself tend—I’m sorry , do you— Bill Kristol . No , I mean I myself tend…not to use the word Islamo-fascism , I just think it’s a little , analytically confusing , I’m not sure fascism is the best way to describe them but , the Islamo-fascists if you wan na use that term , the Takfiris , the terror— Islamic terrorists have killed more Muslims than anyone—than they’ve killed Westerners . And if you talk to Muslims they want those people , to many Muslims including many in Iraq , the greatest single vic— what country has been the greatest victim of the terrorists of al- Qaeda ? </s>
Iraqis , Iraqi Muslims . And they are grateful now that they are going to be able to vote in 2009 in regional elections and in national elections and have a shot at not having a horrible dictator who himself murdered hundreds of thousands of people , who are not being dominated by ghastly Islamo-fascists if you wan na use the word , but I do think , I sort of agree with the question in that sense— Precisely using the term Islamo-fascist separates , the reason you use the term is precisely to say that’s not all of Islam , that’s a little part of it which unfortunately has been ascendant , and if not resisted , will become more ascendant , and we need to help people resist it , we can’t stand back and say hey , none of our business , Afghanistan , Taliban takes over , so tough on you , you know , and Saddam , tough on you guys , and I guess in the Sudan , it’s tough , and other places it’s tough and the Iranian civil society gets suppressed , and I guess we just can’t say anything . And we just say hey , that’s the way they wan na live in that part of the world , I mean that is really what the counsel I think of these sort of realists who want us to think they are going to improve America’s standing in the world and in fact , will correctly call down condemnation on America as has happened in the past . Incidentally , one of the things that encouraged radicalism in the Middle East , was the sense that we were standing aside , and supporting dictators out of narrow self- interest . </s>
The single greatest harm we did to ourselves was stepping back in ’91 , we went in to kick Saddam out of Kuwait which was correct , we needed to do so for strategic reasons , and then we abandoned the people of Iraq , when Saddam turned on them , I don’t think that’s something to be proud of and I very much hope actually that Barack Obama does not revert to that kind of foreign policy . I’d like to quickly— I’d like to quickly return to a question about why was America kept safe for seven years . We’re given two answers , one was luck and the other was that any other President would’ve handled it the same way . </s>
Now luck does come into play . </s>
But luck works when you have the kinda attitude that this President has which is he’s gon na stay on the offense so we fight ‘em over there , and we’re gon na use every intelligence tool at our disposal , to find out what they’re up to . </s>
That is why we broke some of the plots that you know about publicly . You don’t know about all the plots but you know about the attempt to bring down Liberty Tower in Los Angeles , or to blow up airliners simultaneously over the Pacific Ocean . We’re able to break up those plots because this President adopted programs—now maybe , Jacob is right that any other President would’ve pursued the terrorist surveillance program , and the widespread use of our intelligence assets abroad , to listen in on the enemy . I hope he’s right . What do you mean , Karl , by fight them over there , they weren’t in Iraq . </s>
Unless you meant somewhere else by over there . </s>
Well first of all , again I repeat , I appreciate you support for the war in Iraq at the time . Well , I wasn’t— But Jacob , but let’s be honest , he was supporting terrorists , this is a man who , who gave payments to terror bombers . This is a guy who allowed terrorist camps to organize in his country . </s>
The ricin attack in London was launched from a camp in northeast Iraq , this is not a nation which you can organize a terrorist camp without the central authorities knowing about it— Hang on— —in the aftermath—pardon me , let me finish . Okay . </s>
In the aftermath of Afghanistan and taking down the Taliban , where did Zarqawi go for medical treatment . He checked himself into the Mayo Clinic of Baghdad . You don’t get that unless somebody in the government up top allows a known terrorist to seek , to seek succor and medical care in Baghdad , this was a bad actor . Now , did we think he had weapons of mass destruction , you bet , and I’ve got a sheaf-load of quotes from people that you love , like Ted Kennedy and others saying he did . </s>
He didn’t . We now know that . We went in on intelligence that was flawed , but I would remind you of this . Intelligence gets it wrong both ways . </s>
In the run-up to Iraq Muammar Qaddafi looked around and said you know the United States is serious about it , Britain is serious about this , I got problems . </s>
If they’re willing to take out 25 million people and take on Iraq with 25 million people they’re willing to take me on . And he coughed up his weapons programs . And Western intelligence found out they were wrong , they systematically underestimated how far along his chemical and biological programs were which were weaponized , and how far along his nuclear program which—which was way beyond what anybody in Western intelligence thought he had . What was this ricin attack in Britain . Jacob , Simon , the rest of the panel , I wanna— If you wan na respond to Karl’s point , save it for your summary two minutes— </s>
Milk powder , milk powder . Simon— Thanks . </s>
We’re out of time on the questions and answers but you have two minutes to sum up , and you can respond to the point there , I just wan na thank all of you , and encourage you to give yourselves a round of applause for terrific questions . So , I wan na remind you where we are in this Intelligence Squared US debate . We’ve already polled you when you came in before the debate began to see where you agree on the motion . </s>
The motion before us is , “George W. Bush is the worst President of the last 50 years.” </s>
“Bush 43 is the worst President of the last 50 years , ” before the debate , 65 percent of you agreed with the motion , 17 percent were against , 18 percent , one in five of you roughly , were undecided , and we’re going to poll you again shortly but now we move on to the final session of the debate in which each of the panelists has two minutes to summarize . I will step in at the two-minute mark just to tell you that your time is up , and we are going to begin the summary against the motion , that George W. Bush is the worst President of the last 50 years , Bill Kristol , the editor of The Weekly Standard . As someone who grew up not far from here it’s embarrassing frankly that 83 percent of the people who voted think either that Bush is the worst President in 50 years or are undecided about it . Look , people don’t have to like Bush , half the country voted against him in 2000 and—well , virtually almost half in 2004 , if you’re a liberal you won’t approve of his domestic policies , if you think that we’d be better off not having gone into Iraq which obviously is a debatable proposition , you could be very condemnatory of going into Iraq and certainly many people have criticized the way in which we managed that war from 2004 to 2006 . </s>
There’s no reason not to be critical of Bush , not to disagree with Bush , not to prefer Obama , not to have voted for Gore and Kerry , most people in New York obviously , have all those views . But to think that he’s the worst President in 50 years is just silly . It’s just silly and it came out very well in the Vietnam discussion , I mean are we being serious here ? Vietnam was well-run and that was okay somehow and , you know , Westmoreland knew what he was doing . </s>
Of course we lost 55,000 people , we lost a war , 2 million people plus died in Vietnam and Cambodia , it was an unbelievable catastrophe , which the region took a long time to recover from , it was a terrible humiliation moral and political for the United States . That’s like Iraq ? Where we’ve lost 4,000 soldiers , where Iraq is now back on its feet , where we’ve won the war , where we’ve won the war and established US credibility and a willingness to stick to it even though we’ve made terrible mistakes and where we’re actually in pretty good shape with most of the governments in the region , I myself being more of a democracy and human rights activist am a little unhappy that we’re so friendly— Bill , conclude— —with the governments— </s>
—your time is up , 15 seconds grace . </s>
With the governments in the region . </s>
But we are so if we’re in the real world , in the real world you can dislike George W. Bush but you should be against this motion . Summing up for the motion that George W. Bush is the worst American President in the last 50 years , Jacob Weisberg , author of The Bush Tragedy and editor-in-chief of the Slate Group . </s>
Jacob Weisberg . </s>
Thank you . </s>
“We’ve won the war in Iraq , ” there’s something about this “mission accomplished” language that always makes me a little nervous . I think the damage in Iraq can be mitigated , but it can’t— the war can’t be vindicated as a decision . And this goes to the heart of our disagreement , Bill said at the beginning that Bush had bad choices , I don’t think he had bad choices , I think he made bad choices . And I think things could’ve been different for Bush . </s>
I think he could’ve taken a different approach , and in fact it was the approach he took when he was governor of Texas . He could’ve united the country and the world after September 11th , it would’ve given him an opportunity to be a great President , he could’ve reached out to the other party the way FDR did after Pearl Harbor . He could’ve kept his focus on America’s real enemies , as opposed to becoming distracted by Saddam Hussein . He could’ve compromised with Democrats on a whole range of issues including climate change , expanding health care coverage , entitlement reform . </s>
He could’ve focused on protecting the free market instead of the interests of big business . And I think if Bush had tried to govern from the center right , instead of from the far right , he would’ve been reelected by a bigger margin in 2004 and he would’ve been a successful President . But Bush was never up to the job of being President , and it’s not a matter of lacking in intelligence , it’s a matter of lacking character . </s>
Bush wasn’t interested enough in policy , he couldn’t tolerate challenge or dissent or disagreement , he couldn’t open his mind long enough to consider alternatives or admit the possibility that he might sometimes be wrong . He let his righteousness and his arrogance and his anger get the better of him . </s>
And in the end I think what’s so damning about Bush and what does make him the worst President of the last 50 years , is that these were things within his control . And to finish , I think we can say at this point that , American’s great nepotistic experiment is finally coming to an end . It’s— And as my colleague Simon Jenkins has said , it’s finishing not just with failure , not just with rejection , but in global disgrace . Thank you , Jacob Weisberg . </s>
Making his summary statement against the motion that George W. Bush is the worst American President of the last 50 years , Karl Rove , former deputy chief of staff and senior advisor to George W. Bush . John , you said that with a particular glee , I mean it’s , … Look…I wan na end with , by accentuating the point that Bill made , but first of all I need to say Jacob’s comments can be read in his book , which is a piece of fiction . To believe that George W. Bush didn’t tolerate strong people in his cabinet or dissent , or disagreements , is ridiculous . </s>
And to suggest that he’s not interested in ideas is that peculiar form of Bush hatred that causes people to lose their rational senses about the man . And this President has been— This President has been on the receiving end of this kinda attitude since the moment that he took office in an election , that many on the left thought made him an illegitimate President . Now , here’s a man who one of his—the first person that he met with from the United States Congress was the Democrat , ranking Democrat on the House Education and Labor Committee , George Miller . Didn’t compromise with Democrats , didn’t compromise with Democrats on No Child Left Behind which he worked with Ted Kennedy and George Miller and John Boehner and Judd Gregg to get passed . Didn’t cooperate and compromise with Democrats when we came out and endorsed wholesale large elements of the Joe Lieberman program for homeland security . </s>
Didn’t compromise with Democrats when we came out for immigration reform ? You know , that’s just ridiculous . </s>
But I wan na end , ‘cause most of the circle’s around Iraq . Vietnam I agree , better prosecuted than Iraq ? We ended Vietnam in defeat , for which the families of 55,000 fallen heroes , had reason to ask themselves , whether or not that sacrifice had been made in vain . And we’re coming out of Iraq with Iraq becoming a functioning democracy in the heart of the Middle East , still fragile , but because of the surge , and a place today where we can see the moment that US troops can come home with their honor and in victory . And for which the sacrifices of those who have died , will not have been in vain . </s>
Karl Rove , time up , take fifteen seconds , if you need it . </s>
You 're good ? Karl Rove . Summing up , finally , for the motion that “George W. Bush is the Worst President of the Last Fifty Years , ” Simon Jenkins , journalist and columnist for The Guardian . Simon Jenkins . Well , I repeat my view at the very beginning . </s>
I 'm not here to be rude about an American President . I would just point out about Iraq , you can not say something’s a success when I saw last week two million Iraqi’s are camped outside Damascus because they have n't got the nerve to go home to their homeland because the Americans are there . Two thirds of all the Christians in Iraq have been driven out of that country under America’s aegis . Fundamentalism is far more rife in southern Iraq than it ever was under Saddam Hussein . Let’s just get some facts here . </s>
However , let me come back to the original point , I had great respect for Bush when he came to power . I liked his courtesy , I liked his moderation , and I liked his concept of humility in America’s power projection . I think , tragically , after 9/11 he allowed the politics of fear to get the better of him , he persuaded my Prime Minister , Tony Blair , to let the politics of fear aid his re-election campaign as well . The politics of fear is the most corrosive of all forms of politics in a democracy . </s>
Power , and America remains… …remains a hugely powerful country , power has an obligation of restraint . If you 're the most powerful country in the world , your obligation is not to go over the top , to charge around the world invading countries on the feeblest of pretexts , your obligation is to show restraint . My America was always a country of huge self confidence , belief in its ability to resist attack of any sort , and not needing to erode its own freedoms and those of other people in order to achieve that defense of democracy . I personally think that you’ve just elected a man who I have found , from when I first read his book , a truly remarkable figure , on whom I think it is right to place great expectations . </s>
And , but , he has got to recover from a terrible legacy in the world , outside America . I still believe he will . I think you have a terrific future ahead of you , but you have been through an awful eight years . Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you , Simon Jenkins . And may I invite a round of applause for our entire panel . I 'm asking them to sit back down for the moment of truth . Gentleman , have your seats once more , because we have to decide the winner . Let’s remember where we are . </s>
We have heard the debates , we have heard the arguments , and we have heard from you when you came into this debate , that sixty-five percent of you were for the motion , that “George W. Bush is the Worst American President of the Last Fifty Years , ” “Bush 43 is the Worst President of the Last Fifty Years.” It is now time for you , seventeen percent of you were against , and eighteen percent , one in five , were undecided . It is now time for you to reach for those keypads and register your decision at this point . </s>
While you 're doing that , I will… Does anybody need more time ? </s>
Is everybody locked in ? </s>
OK . </s>
Sorry ? </s>
Oh , I 'm sorry , some of you were n't here in the beginning , which really is going to mess up the numbers , is n't it ? You press one if you are for the motion , two if you are against the motion , and three if you remain undecided . </s>
The other keys don’t matter . </s>
If you make a mistake , just re-enter your number , and your last number will be recorded by the computer . Everyone is clear on that ? And does anyone need more time ? </s>
Just shout out . OK , so the numbers are being tabulated , it will take about ninety seconds . And while we’re waiting for the vote I would like to remind you that our next debate will be here again at the Symphony Space , and it will be recorded once again for broadcast on BBC World News Television . The motion to be debated on Tuesday , January 13th , 2009 , is this : “Major Reductions in Carbon Emissions are not Worth the Money.” Panelists for the motion are Peter Huber , Bjorn Lomborg , and Philip Stott . </s>
Against the motion , Daniel Kammen , Oliver Tickell , and Adam Werbach . And we will see you all back here in January at Symphony Space . And just in time , thank you , the results come . Well , we tend to judge who is the winner by who moved most positions , and in that case , I’ll give you the numbers in a second , but the bottom line is that those against the motion changed more minds tonight than those for the motion . </s>
Before the debate sixty-five percent were for the motion , seventeen percent against , and eighteen percent undecided . After the debate , sixty-eight percent were for the motion , twenty-seven percent are against the motion , and five percent remain undecided . Congratulations to all of our panelists , congratulations to you , and thank you for joining us at this Intelligence Squared US Debate . Intelligence Squared U.S. , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Well , thank you all for coming . </s>
This is really exciting for us . </s>
This is a new venue , and it’s thrilling for us to be downtown in such magnificent space as this one . We have , of course , our new voting system which may have some flaws to iron out . We have a new relationship with Bloomberg Television that’s going to be televising these debates in addition to our longstanding relationship with National Public Radio , where these debates are heard in nearly two hundred radio markets around the country . We have a new relationship with Newsweek magazine that’s going to be publishing a Point/Counterpoint of what goes on this evening . So my role in these proceedings is really to frame the debate , to say why it is we thought this was an interesting topic and why there’s a reasonable amount to be said on both sides . </s>
So , as taxpayers , Americans have funded about seven hundred and fifty billion dollars for the stimulus package , another seven hundred and fifty billion or more for TARP , to relieve the situation for financial institutions . And at a time of record unemployment doesn’t it make sense that these funds are used to the maximum extent possible to create jobs for Americans ? Why not require that the institutions that receive this money hire American workers ? Why not , that the state governments and others who are expending these funds buy American products ? </s>
But let’s consider second order consequences . If we protect high cost domestic producers there’s a cost to that in the form of higher prices for everyone else -- every consumer , every state and local government . And then think about the third order effects – the reactions of foreign governments . </s>
We impose a tax , a tariff on tires , the Chinese retaliate with a tariff on chickens -- real world example of the last week or so . Well , which of these is most important -- the immediate benefit of U.S. job creation or the cost to U.S. consumers and the risk of retaliatory response from our trading partners ? The future of the global economy may depend on getting the answer right and we have an extraordinarily able group of panelists this evening who I think are going to shed some light on this important issue and it’s my pleasure at this point to turn the evening over to John Donvan . Thank you , Robert , very much . </s>
And this is the beginning of our fourth season and Robert Rosenkranz is why this is happening . So on this evening I just want to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz . Welcome to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I’m John Donvan and I will be moderating the six people you see here on the stage with me at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . We have two tables , six debaters , three against three . </s>
We’ll be debating this motion : Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire . </s>
And here , our debaters arguing for the motion that Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire , Jagdish Bhagwati , University Professor , Economics and Law at Columbia University ; Douglas Irwin , Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College ; and Susan Schwab , former United States Trade Representative . Arguing against the motion we have Leo Gerard , International President of the United Steel Workers ; John R. MacArthur , President and Publisher of Harper’s magazine ; Jeff Madrick , Senior Fellow at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School . Now , this is a debate so let’s remind ourselves of what the stakes are . There will be winners and losers tonight . This is a contest . </s>
This is a contest of ideas and persuasion and perhaps wit and humor , facts . But you in the audience play a crucial role in this contest because you are the judges . </s>
We are polling you both before and after the debate to establish where you stand on our motion . I will be reporting them in just a little while , once we’ve had the first results tabulated . But once again , to remind you , our motion is that Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire and we would like now to go to our vote for the final time . If any of the members of the audience still would like another chance to vote , if you put your hands up I’ll know that the answer to that is yes . And it looks like no . </s>
So everybody has , everybody has voted . So the results are being tabulated . We will have you a vote once again at the end of the debate and the side that has changed the most minds , who has moved the largest percentage into their camp in the course of the evening will be declared our winner . Let’s get to the debate . Speaking for the motion first , -- I’m sorry , I thought I had something out of the order . </s>
Speaking for the motion first , Douglas Irwin , a professor at Dartmouth College . Free Trade Under Fire is the title of his latest book and those four words will tell us why he is here to argue for the motion that Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire . Douglas Irwin . </s>
Well , I apologize if my voice is a little bit gravely but I used up most of it yesterday when I achieved a childhood dream of seeing the Green Bay Packers play at Lambeau Field . And I learned , aside from the fact that Green Bay can lose a game they’re supposed to win , I learned that you can get very funny faces on people’s faces when , very funny looks on people’s faces when you amble up to them in Green Bay and say , So what do you think of them Buy American provisions ? It doesn’t , it doesn’t work so well . It’s a real conversation stopper . What I’d like to do is remind you of the proposition before you tonight and that is whether Buy American provisions will backfire . </s>
In fact , they’ve already backfired so you have little choice but to vote for the affirmative . First of all , what is Buy American ? </s>
Buy American is a provision in federal legislation that mandates the purchase of U.S. made products in government contracts . </s>
Now , in some sense , who could be against Buy American ? </s>
I want people to buy American products . I want a strong and healthy and vibrant American economy . </s>
I want good jobs and good wages for American workers . I think we can all agree on those propositions . </s>
But that’s not the issue . The debate here tonight is about the means to that laudable end . Buy America may sound like it’s a good idea , but the more you think about it , it’s actually counterproductive . Let me give you a specific example of what Buy America is . In the economic stimulus bill that we talked about earlier , that John Donvan mentioned -- it was passed by Congress earlier this year -- one section requires the use of American made steel in all stimulus related construction projects unless it costs more than twenty-five percent above foreign suppliers . </s>
Now , this is a good deal for the American steel industry but it’s a bad deal for the rest of us . By raising the cost of construction projects our nation can afford fewer of those projects . </s>
That means fewer jobs will be created with the limited amount of money we have to spend . If we have to pay a twenty-five percent premium for steel that leaves less money for all the other projects . In fact , this is not a trivial matter . Picture in your mind for a moment the Bay Bridge in San Francisco . There’s a lot of steel in that bridge . </s>
California had to repair the bridge a few years ago and the Buy America provisions were enforced . The domestic steel bid came in at , guess what ? , twenty-three percent above the foreign bid . Now , why it wasn’t twenty-four percent above , I don’t know . But that added four hundred million dollars to the cost to repair the bridge . That’s almost half a billion dollars for one project . </s>
Now , what can you do with half a billion dollars ? </s>
Instead of paying inflated prices for steel you could repair roads , build new bridges , build new schools , invest in green technology , provide health care for children or even perhaps reduce the fiscal deficit that is literally bankrupt ... bankrupting the state of California . That’s more than just paying more and getting less . The real problem is this : Buy America is a bad jobs creation program . Steel is very capital intensive so when we increase production we don’t hire a lot of new workers . There are about a hundred and fifty thousand steel workers in the United States . </s>
There are seven million construction workers . There are 1.5 million unemployed construction workers . </s>
Construction is really labor intensive . </s>
So if we spend more taxpayer money on steel we can afford fewer construction projects that will employ more construction workers who really need the jobs . So why do we give U.S. steel producers a twenty-five percent handicap against foreign suppliers and other bidders ? </s>
Well , they were the only industry that was powerful enough to get it into law . It’s corporate welfare , pure and simple . What percent of the steel sold in the United States is made in the United States ? Seventy percent . </s>
They control seventy percent of the market and they want more and they want the taxpayer to pay for it . Buy America has already backfired because it creates bureaucratic red tape that has forced state and local governments to delay starting infrastructure projects and therefore , delay getting people back to work . In Perkins , Oklahoma they’re planning on building a new waste water plant for fifteen million dollars . </s>
It was shovel ready . The government came in to give them another 1.5 million in free stimulus money . But it wasn’t free . It came with Buy America and other pieces of red tape and it raised the cost of the project even more than the town would be getting from the federal government . So now the town has to go out and borrow more money to get the project going . </s>
And this is not an isolated example . Here’s a news article from last week’s Wall St. Journal how Buy America can hurt U.S. firms , and it talks about how , various ways in which U.S. firms can not bid on municipal projects here in the United States because they may make components that are sent for final processing in Canada . </s>
They come back from Canada , and it’s called a Canadian product even though a lot of the value added is made here in the United States . And that just doesn’t make sense . Many think that Buy America is aimed at China . </s>
Well , we aimed at China but we hit Canada and now we’re shooting ourselves in the foot . Canadian governments are boycotting U.S. firms in their infrastructure projects and costing us jobs here in the United States . </s>
So in sum , Buy America is not a good idea . It raises the cost of -- It sounds like a good idea but it’s not a good idea . It raises the cost of infrastructure projects . It pads the bottom line of the steel industry . </s>
It reduces the number of construction workers we can employ with our precious tax dollars and when other countries employ their own buy local provisions our exporters will be cut out of their lucrative market , those lucrative markets abroad and will lose even more manufacturing jobs here in the United States . </s>
I’m sure you’ve heard of the saying , What’s good for GM is good for America . Well , we know that’s not true . And what’s good for the steel industry , its workers and its executives is not good for America , either , necessarily . </s>
So Buy America is costly corporate welfare . It’s already backfired . Please vote affirmative . </s>
Thank you very much . JOHN DONVAN Thank you , Douglas Irwin . And now to argue against the motion that Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire , Leo Gerard , who is the son of a miner from Canada . </s>
And now that he is International President of the United Steel Workers , when he steps up to that microphone he has eight hundred , fifty thousand union members standing behind him . Leo Gerard . Thank you very much . </s>
I have to tell you that I’ve discarded a lot of my notes because I want to correct the previous speaker . The fact of the matter is that China did win the bid for the Bay Bridge and the fact of the matter is that the Bay Bridge is now almost eight months behind schedule and that the steel that came from China won’t hold the weld . And they’re not sure if they’re going to have to rip it all down and rebuild it , so that , if we talk about what that represents in lost dollars and productivity , it’s way more than the number that Doug used . </s>
Let me then go back to my notes . The fact of the matter is that three trillion tax dollars per year are spent by the federal government in federal procurement . And no one is saying that it’s simply , that you get the money that comes from tax dollars and you use it to buy Chinese goods . </s>
And then the fact of the matter is this has gone through the roof since the passage of NAFTA and PNTR . And what we’ve done is we’ve lost , in our manufacturing base from 1949 to ’69 , manufacturing was twenty-eight percent of the economy of America and we were the world’s largest creditor nation . </s>
By the time we got to the end of last year manufacturing was nine percent of the economy and we have now become the world’s largest debtor nation . The fact of the matter is , if we don’t start buying products that are made here , what we’ll end up doing is borrowing Chinese money to import Chinese parts and have laid-off workers . </s>
And the fact of the matter is that Buy America stimulates the economy , creates good jobs , makes the industrial economy work and if the industrial economy works then we need engineers , innovation and we need the other pieces that make that economy hum . </s>
There was all kinds of yelling and screaming , when the Buy America provision was made public in the stimulus bill , like this is something new . There’s been Buy America provisions since 1930s . And the fact of the matter is that they’ve been good for creating jobs . If we go back to the period from 1994 when we abandoned , in a much more aggressive way , industrial manufacturing in America , in that period of time America has accumulated a 6.5 trillion dollar trade debt . We’ve had twenty-five years in a row , exacerbated since 1994 , of year after year after year record breaking trade deficits . </s>
This year people will say , Yeah , well , the trade deficit’s falling down . It’s probably going to come in around five hundred billion dollars and we’ve had a huge drop . That’s simply because there’s no purchasing power and we’ve had the collapse of the credit markets . There can be an argument made that a large part of the economic collapse that we saw is because there was too much money in the wrong direction . And the fact of the matter is that , that money , making its hands into a much , much smaller group , led to an inability of us to sustain . </s>
And we’ve , over the last fifteen years , gone to personal debt that is unsustainable . All of that because we’ve abandoned the idea of not only making things in America , but buying things that are made in America . </s>
I won’t spend too much time , but if we look at what’s going on in most of our trading partners , in the E.U . and spend time with China ... I never heard a word in America when French President Sarkozy said that they’re going to stimulate their economy and they’re going to stimulate their auto industry on the condition that every taxpayer dollar of French currency that’s invested in France is going to go to prop up the French auto industry and the French auto industry had to commit to no layoffs . Surprisingly , the European economy is bouncing back faster than ours . I didn’t hear a word . I didn’t hear a word when in May the Chinese government said that their stimulus program was going to be steered and directed towards not just Buy China -- there is a slight difference -- Buy Chinese . </s>
I didn’t hear a word here . Think of the auto industry . I’ve only ever driven a North American car , big three . </s>
I’ve never had a bad one . But for some reason , we’re prepared as a society to tolerate a deficit in automobiles between South Korea and Japan of forty-five billion dollars a year . </s>
If a billion dollars equals thirteen thousand family-supporting jobs , just in the auto sector , year after year after year , we can’t get into their market . They have a view that buying a Japanese car in Japan is a good thing . China has recently announced that it intends to dominate the world in renewable energy products . </s>
A company called Suntech Power Holdings said in an interview that to build market share -- this is what’s coming from China -- to build market share it’s selling solar panels on the American market for less than the cost of materials , assembly and shipping . </s>
This is a decision made in China . </s>
And we’re saying that we want to be the leader in renewable energy but we don’t have a program to stimulate demand or to buy renewable energy products that are made in America . Having said that , I see that my time is up . But keep in mind that in order to do that China cheats on its currency , it manipulates its cost of production and we sit back and say that it would cost us jobs if we did the same thing . Leo Gerard , thank you very much . I just want to make the request to -- back on cell phones , if anybody still has their cell phone turned on as a result of the voting exercise , to turn it off now because I’ve been told it might be interfering with the radio waves might be interfering with some of the audio in the room . </s>
So I’ll just listen to everybody’s phones sing for a second while that happens . </s>
And again , for newcomers , I want to explain that we have opening statements of seven minutes each . That will be followed by a round of head to head debate in which I’ll ask questions and you’ll ask questions . </s>
And at the end of the evening we’ll have summary statements of two minutes each , after which you will vote once again . Are all of the cell phones off ? It looks like they are . </s>
To resume , the motion here is that Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire . </s>
And our next debater is going to argue in the affirmative . He thinks that Buy American will backfire , not surprisingly , because he is one of the world’s pre-eminent economists and has long argued that globalization is the world’s most powerful force for social good . From Columbia University , Jagdish Bhagwati . </s>
Thank you very much . </s>
Let me just begin first by emphasizing a point which Doug Irwin made , but in relation to a story . When I was a student at Oxford one of my professors actually told me that he’d gone to Whitehall to advise and he was surprised to find that while he thought economics oversimplified things , that in fact , people in Whitehall were working with even more simplistic models . They usually thought X led to Y and they stopped there . </s>
Y leading to Z , Z leading in turn to X . </s>
All of that was completely beyond them . They were extremely oversimplifying . The problem , I think , with Mr. Gerard is , I think , as Doug was pointing out , and with the opposing side basically , is that you think that Buy America will create jobs in the steel using sectors , for example , or in the steel industry . First , in fact , X affects Y . </s>
But what does that do to the rest of the system ? </s>
Because you are then opening up a whole series of additional effects which are actually going to overwhelm the initial primary impact . </s>
And that’s essentially what we need to focus on . What are these additional effects ? One , of course , is that downstream industries typically become more uncompetitive . We know when President Bush put on the steel tariffs in ’92 the effect was , in fact , to price out a whole lot of steel using industries , including autos , which indeed , there was a famous study which shows that about two hundred thousand jobs may have been lost while we gained a few basically through protecting steel . So that’s point number one . </s>
The second point is that you get out of this , and still , even if we didn’t have this problem we would have the problem of retaliation . </s>
And I would say it’s not tit for tat retaliation necessarily . It’s also monkey see , monkey do kind of imitation . While we do something others do the same thing . </s>
If you look at the 1930s it was exactly spreading and diffusion of all kinds of trade barriers , starting out from the Smoot- Hawley , et cetera . And this , I think , led to essentially what we in economics call a nuclear winter , basically . There was a chaotic outbreak of all kinds of trade barriers . That came home to roost in turn , on our export performance , on everybody’s export performance . And I think this is something we need to remember , that as we go into this , policies like Buy America , that is what we are going to get into . </s>
We already see that , as Doug was pointing out , in a variety of fields . And I’m sure Susan will pick up that theme . The large numbers of actual actions which we already see by way of diffusion of these kinds of tariffs . And we are actually the biggest traders in the world . </s>
Every state has export industries . I’ve been looking at that . </s>
You have basically , therefore , a lot of your jobs at stake . </s>
And those are going to outweigh the few jobs you may save through Buy America provisions . </s>
I think this is , if you look at Buy America , if you know a little bit of history -- I know just a little bit and Doug knows much more -- but Buy America , when did it first get passed in this country ? It has to be in this country , obviously , if it was Buy America . It was 1933 , right after the Depression , the great . </s>
And that’s what set the stage . And I think we are now re-enacting that after this current crisis . So beware , is all I say . </s>
Caveat emptor , if you want , feel inclined to be working for the other side . Then I think we also got the argument , to look at the negative arguments produced by Mr. Gerard in his interesting comment , he said , Well , manufacturers are important and we need to support them . And he’s not the first one to have said that . There has been an anti-de-industrialization movement in England , about twenty years ago . </s>
There was also a Berkeley movement called Manufacturing Matters . And I think Mr. Gerard is really harking back to it . And this is a case where you assert that manufacturing is some sort of massive externalities . And I would simply say , I’ll just quote my old teacher , Professor Solow , who is Nobel Laureate and the father figure on the Democratic side . </s>
I’m a Democrat . </s>
He said , I know there are lots of industries in massive externalities . But there’s a four dollar worth of marginal , social marginal product and the private margin product is one , one dollar . And he said , My problem is I don’t know which ones they are . </s>
And the problem is , and compounded by the fact that the lobbies know where the externalities are . </s>
And I think this is the problem . It’s not that we don’t believe that there are externalities , but for Mr. Gerard to assume that they are necessarily in steel or in manufacturers more generally has never been proven . And I don’t think any Democrat would support that view . </s>
In fact , what we do is essentially to argue that we must support broader policies like R & D support and so on , but not go into specific activities cause that’s exactly the wrong way to go and it gets captured by , by several people . And I think this is what we need to worry about . Finally , I would just touch on one thing which drives , I think , the union movement . And I can understand their fear because I can easily produce models being a theorist also , aside from an activist on these issues . </s>
One can easily produce models where international trade actually affects your workers , that in fact the fear is , on the part of unions , that trade with the poor countries produces paupers in the rich countries . Now , a lot of work has been done on this . Actually , there’s very little evidence of this . </s>
In fact , there are studies , including my own with Bob Lawrence at Harvard , which show actually that the pressure on our wages , which is a real problem and , you know , as a Democrat I’m entirely sympathetic to the problem . That has been brought about by extremely acute labor saving technical change , by the fact that the unionization has also gone down for reasons which don’t have much to do with globalization or trade . Given that , I think a lot of us have argued with empirical evidence that trade with poor countries , trade with emerging countries has actually kept the consumption cost of workers’ wages down . So it , in fact , it has moderated the -- Jagdish Bhagwati , I’m sorry , your time is up . </s>
So I will pick up the argument later . I want to help , ask you to help with a little piece of radio production . At this point on the NPR broadcast they take a break . </s>
And then we come back again to the broadcast and it’s very helpful if it’s refreshed with a round of applause from all of you . So I’d like to ask you to do that . Welcome back to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I’m John Donvan , your moderator . The proposition we are debating here is : Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire . </s>
We have six panelists , three against three . And next to speak against the motion : Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire , John R. MacArthur , known as Rick . </s>
He is President and Publisher of Harper’s magazine , the oldest continuously published monthly magazine in America and also one of the most progressive . Ladies and gentlemen , Rick MacArthur . JOHN R. MacARTHUR I have totell you that I wrote a book about NAFTA , called The Selling of Free Trade . </s>
That’s why I’m here , not because I’m publisher of Harper’s magazine . But may I make a cheap debater’s point right at the outset and say that Professor Irwin has already veered off the proposition . </s>
This is a , the question I thought that was put was , Buy American policies , not the Buy American provision in the legislation that just passed six or eight months ago . </s>
And if we’re going to discuss this broadly we have to talk about tariffs versus free trade , protectionism versus free trade . That’s what we’re really talking about here . I would also add that , I hope we can come back to Smoot-Hawley because Smoot-Hawley is a canard , as it is acknowledged by many , many mainstream economists who say that it had little or no affect on exacerbating the Great Depression . But there’s a reason why Thomas Carlyle called economics the dismal science . I happen to think it’s because he understood intuitively that it was not a science , and that it’s not a science because you can not conduct a controlled experiment in economics the way you can in hard science , in real science . </s>
And as a non-science , we have to turn back to the great theorists of free trade and the anti-protectionists like David Ricardo and Richard Cobden and understand that they , in the early 19th Century , could not imagine a world where anybody with money and labor could plug into a power source anywhere in the world and make virtually anything . These theorists , to whom Professor Bhagwati , Professor Irwin and many of their colleagues cling with religious fervor , with -- I might even say -- Marxist fervor , because Ricardo had a great influence on Marx , is what distorts the debate . As then MIT economist Paul Krugman , who was and still is a partisan of free trade , noted in a 1991 book called Geography and Trade , the quote : The tendency of international economists to turn a blind eye to the fact that countries both occupy and exist in space , a tendency so deeply entrenched that we rarely even realize we are doing it , has , I would submit , had some serious costs . </s>
These lie not so much in lack of realism -- all economic analysis is more or less unrealistic -- as in the exclusion of important issues , and above all , important sources of evidence . </s>
Now , let’s admit , on the protectionist side , that Buy American policies are indirect tariffs , indirect subsidies , whatever you want to call them . And there are many statistics to support the protectionist model . I don’t pretend they’re definitive any more than my economist friends can make the argument that their statistics or their studies are definitive because they’re not scientific experiments . But since we’re talking about protectionism versus free trade , essentially , we can site some spectacularly successful protectionist schemes , Mexico , poor , beleaguered , exploited Mexico in the ‘50s , ‘60s and ‘70s , had a program called import substitution , a nice way of saying , or a technical way of saying , buy Mexican . </s>
And Mexico enjoyed the highest growth rates in its history , through the ‘50s , ‘60s and ‘70s , of , roughly , I think averaging about 7 percent . Just to give you a more specific recent example , we still have a 25 percent tariff , import tariff on pickup trucks in the United States . That’s why , Toyota , until very recently , was still manufacturing pickups at their NUMMI , joint operating plant in Fremont , California , in their joint operation with General Motors . That’s what kept Toyota in the game , was the 25 percent tariff on imported pickups . It’s probably not a coincidence that in 1945 , the average US tariff on dutiable imports was 28 percent . </s>
And in the same year , manufacturing employment which as you all knows pays better than working at Wal-Mart , manufacturing employment as a percentage of total US employment was 35 percent . </s>
It’s also likely not a coincidence , that in 2008 , the average tariff on dutiable imports was 4 percent—by the way these are Professor Irwin’s numbers— and in the same year manufacturing employment as a percentage of to—total US employment , was just under 10 percent . Now . Again , this is anecdotal evidence , I don’t pretend it’s scientific , but in 1979 , the year in which manufacturing employment peaked in the United States , the median weekly earnings for all US workers in 2009 dollars , was $ 716.47 . In the second quarter of 2009 , the median weekly earnings for US workers , was $ 734 , just slightly above , so we can make the argument that a pro-free trade , lower-tariff economy has possibly contributed to the stagnation of wages , I think we can say anecdotally , that because manufacturing employment has declined , and manufacturing jobs pay better than service jobs generally speaking , this has contributed to the stagnation of wages . Now , this is not only happening in the , labor-intensive traditional assembly-line jobs . </s>
Business Week just had a cover story called “America’s Manufacturing Crisis” in which they talked about , the crisis in high-tech manufacturing . And the causes of this manufacturing decline in American high- tech , quote , “are numerous , complex , and a long time in the making.” </s>
That’s from Willy Shih , a Harvard Business School professor who used to work at IBM , and used to run Eastman Kodak’s Digital Consumer Products Union . And then , Business Week goes on , to paraphrase they say two decades of unconstrained outsourcing to Asia have hollowed out much of America’s base of supplies , factory managers , and skilled technicians . </s>
US private capital markets meanwhile are loath to tie up their billions in factories and machinery . </s>
In the boom years from 1994 to 1999 , when then economy surged 26 percent , US manufacturing capacity went up by 44 percent . </s>
Okay ? </s>
But from 2002 through 2007 when the US expanded by 17 percent , manufacturing capacity rose a paltry 5 percent . Rick MacArthur , your time’s up . JOHN R. MacARTHUR Okay . And I’ll just say that , it’s no coincidence that permanent normal trade relations with China were passed , in 2000 . </s>
JOHN DONVAN Thank you . Our next debater Susan Schwab was to any of our international trading partners the face of US trade , holding as she did the post of United States Trade Representative in the George W. Bush administration , that is a Cabinet-level position . She saw firsthand government thinking on trade and she also influenced it , and now at the University of Maryland , she is here to argue , that Buy American , Hire American policies will backfire , Susan Schwab . </s>
Thank you , and thank you very much for inviting us here today to debate this very timely and very interesting and very complicated topic . </s>
I’m going to start by talking about Hire American policies , which is part of this debate although no one’s talked about it yet and I’m going to make quick work of that , because quite frankly Hire American restrictions are un- American . </s>
They are discriminatory , they reek of discrimination , they deny us the very diversity that has made the United States , as competitive as we are . Immigrants built this nation and all you need to do is look at some of the companies that were founded by immigrants or children of immigrants the employ millions of Americans , including Google , Intel , eBay , Yahoo , Proctor and Gamble , duPont and even US Steel . </s>
Buy American ? </s>
Buy American sounds like motherhood and apple pie , and , unfortunately , Buy American policies hurt America , and hurt Americans . And we have history to point to and we have , the fact that the United States has to export to grow , to point to , and the fact that the risk of retaliation is very , very real indeed , let’s start with history . Rick mentioned Smoot-Hawley , well , guess what . In the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act we raised our tariffs , it was perfectly legal under the international trading system at the time . </s>
It ultimately prolonged and deepened the Great Depression . </s>
No country , no country has ever reached or sustained a level of prosperity with economic isolationism as their policy , with trade protectionism as their policy , with buy national policies . In fact if you look at the 1990s the countries that grew the fast in the 1990s , were countries that opened their markets , followed our lead by the way , opening our markets . They grew three times faster than the countries that did not open their markets . 95 percent of the world’s population , meaning the world’s consumers , live outside of our borders . </s>
Those are our customers and if anyone thinks that we Americans have enough money to buy our way to recovery , and to future competitiveness without exports , you’ve got another thing coming . Half of GDP growth , more than half of global GDP growth going forward over the next five years , will come in the advanced developing countries . </s>
The bulk of global economic growth will come outside the United States . </s>
And if you’re talking about stimulus packages and quite frankly , Rick , this debate is about Buy American policies , meaning the government telling us , that it will not buy foreign goods whether they are higher quality , whether they are better priced . $ 3.5 trillion will be spent in the next several years , by other countries on stimulus . Globally . We need a piece of that . </s>
And if you are a Caterpillar worker in Illinois , if you work for G.E. , if you work for any of the major manufacturers in the United States that sell to these countries , you want a part of that action . China is going to be spending the vast majority of the $ 550 billion it’s putting into stimulus , on infrastructure . That is business for American exporters . India is going to be spending anywhere from $ 20- $ 70 billion in roads construction . </s>
Now . </s>
This issue , this canard , of—that we don’t manufacture anything , is utterly absurd . Some of you may be surprised to know that the United States remains the single biggest manufacturer in the world , bar none . $ 1.7 trillion in manufacturing outputs , China is a distant second , at $ 1.3 trillion , with Japan and Germany following up to the rear . </s>
One in six manufacturing jobs depends on exports , 6 million US jobs depend on manufactured good exports . And if you look at US economic growth you discover , that our manufacturing is in fact 20 percent of our GDP , not 9 percent . </s>
And it continues to grow , our manufacturing output . Yes , our manufacturing employment , because of productivity enhancements , technology , has not kept pace . </s>
But if you look for example at a company like UPS that tells us for every 40 new packages that are shipped overseas , they hire a new American worker . Those are high-paying blue-collar jobs , Fed Ex , exactly the same kind of statistics . And in many cases you’re talking about , these are Teamsters who are going to be hired . Retaliation , retaliation is not some myth , retaliation is very , very real , not only did we see it after…Smoot-Hawley , we saw it after the Buy American language , it is not coincidence , that within six weeks of the Buy American legislature on the stimulus package moving through the United States Congress , it is not coincidence that the Chinese suddenly decided to let their provinces favor local companies , because before that a lot of Americans were starting to make a lot of money in those markets . </s>
We need access to those markets , and we need to be exporting to stay competitive . The folks who are telling us , this isn’t going to happen , they are ignoring the fact that the Canadians have already retaliated , the Chinese have already retaliated . The US Chamber of Commerce estimates that for every 1 percent of this global stimulus bonanza that is out there , that we lose because of retaliation , we lose 175,000 jobs . That eclipses the , what , eight , 9,000 jobs that the Petersen Institute has told us could possibly be created in the steel industry in the United States , and Doug has already talked about how that has hurt other workers in construction and so on . So let me close…as follows . </s>
One , remind you , there is zero evidence that buy national policies create more jobs than they sacrifice , and in fact the data is very , very compelling the other way , trade isolationism kills jobs , it does not create jobs . Buy American sounds good . And the issues that are being raised by the other side in many ways are legitimate issues . </s>
But Buy American policies and trade isolationism will not solve any one of the problems that they are describing . Buy American sounds good , good sound bite , bad policy , hurts America , hurts American jobs , thank you . And finally , speaking against the motion , “Buy American-Hire American Policies Will Backfire , ” Jeff Madrick , a business journalist and visiting professor at the Cooper Union , in the mid- 1990s he predicted The End of Affluence with a bestseller that went by that very name . </s>
His latest book , The Case for Big Government—the title alone tells you much about his political take on the world , as he argues now against the motion , ladies and gentlemen , Jeff Madrick . </s>
Thank you , thank you , I’m delighted to be here . I was once a free-trader myself , as was Philip Verlager who I see had a letter in the New York Times just Sunday saying he was once a free- trader . </s>
Worked for the Petersen Institute , decided it was totally unrealistic . Enough is enough . I’m a little tired of people who keep telling us—not these people . That wasn’t aimed at you , that , uh— Little tired of being told time and again , that being worried about free trade is an oversimplified point of view . </s>
I’m a little tired of being given simplistic examples , of where buying , say , steel in the US , will raise construction costs and therefore cost American jobs . I’m tired of being told that empirical studies invariably show that free trade will create—has almost no effect on jobs in the US , and you know I better tell you the truth about that , because , I have a whole bunch of things to say , I’m not going to get to them , and I’m going to forget some . The fact of the matter is , despite what Professor Bhagwati said , and despite his own studies , most studies find a direct negative impact , from free trade on wages , and on the creation of jobs . Most studies . </s>
Not by wide-eyed progressives from the New School , but by mainstream economists . </s>
Most studies , so let’s get the facts straight . </s>
I want to go down this list because this is too important , I’m afraid , to leave to economic theorists . I believed in Ricardian economics , I still do . </s>
Exchange is the key to economic growth . You have something I want , I want something—I have something you want . It leads to economic growth , but it is a narrow idealistic theory , in a very complex world . </s>
First , Buy America is not illegal . </s>
China agreed to the very terms we are citing in this stimulus bill . That’s number one . It is not illegal , neither by the way are the tariffs on tires . Not illegal , they agreed to it , in the international agreements . Number two . </s>
The fiscal policy becomes necessarily ineffective when 20 to 30 to 40 percent of every dollar we spend , to pump up our economy in a recessionary emergency , leaks overseas . We’re not saying all—we should not have exports and imports , nobody on my teams thinks we shouldn’t have export growth , and even import growth . Nobody I know believes that . But we do want effective fiscal policy and that is what we are talking about in the narrow sense . </s>
Will there be a trade war ? Darn it , I am tired of these scare tactics , I’m tired of claiming there will be a repeat of the 1930s . Is China up in arms against this policy , I suspect China is now willing to talk a little bit , because they see maybe President Obama is ever so slightly serious about imposing rights he was given in international treaties into which China agreed . Is China not pushing its tires , a surge in tires here ? </s>
Of course they are . And that was a response , another issue . Let’s stop isolating this economic theory from the real world . China subsidizes , all kinds of countries subsidize , all kinds of countries push exports . We have to begin to realize that . </s>
Let’s look at what’s happened , and I’m skipping as you can tell a little bit , let’s look at what’s happened in America since free trade . </s>
Don’t think this side of the podium is fighting an uphill battle . They won . They’ve won for decades . </s>
Tariffs have come down significantly . And where does America stand in terms of wages , you’d think , judging by what some of them said , we’re doing great . </s>
The median male worker in America today , makes less than the median male worker after inflation did in the 1970s . </s>
Think about that . That stagnation probably never occurred in American economic history before . We did some numbers on this , it’s pretty stun— I’m not going to go into those because , my time is running low , maybe we’ll get to it in the Q-and-A . </s>
Frank Levy , and Peter Temin , mainstream economists , at MIT , are alarmed , that annual earnings of all workers , not just males , male and female , all races , all ethnicities , plus fringe benefits , which people often say are left out by—people like Robert Lawrence often make this case—plus fringe benefits haven’t been keeping up with productivity since roughly the late 1970s . Wages are supposed to keep up with productivity . </s>
What’s going on , is free trade part of this ? I think it is part of it . Is it all of it , no , is it most of it , it may not even be most of it . But it’s probably some of it and we’ve got ta start thinking about that . </s>
I have to say one other thing about economic theory while I’m going through this litany . There is a very strong emphasis on keeping wages down in America , you may have noticed , every time wages go up the Federal Reserve in the good old days , that was before the crisis , would try to push wages down because it was going to be inflationary . </s>
A very important theory of why economies grow , has been thrown aside . That is economies grow because American workers , and the immigrant workers who come to America make enough money to support demand so the companies can grow . And then companies invest . All through American history , wages rose inexorably . In America , median wages , average wages , rose , and were a source of economic growth . </s>
That stopped somewhere in the 1970s . And we better start thinking about it , what am I thinking , what am I talking about ? </s>
Not full-scale protectionism , not the end of exports and imports . </s>
But a serious , committed , complex…not simple theory , of why economies grow , but a complex analysis and approach to dealing with a high dollar . With high debt in America . </s>
With trade inequalities . With industrial policies and export subsidies overseas . And an attempt , and I think interestingly , the other side did not use its strongest argument . Free trade , our buying from overseas , helps those poor countries , where wages are really low . I think as decent human beings we should all be for them , look what’s happened . </s>
It hasn’t gotten to them for the most part . It hasn’t gotten to them in nearly the amount it should . We’ve got to think much more broadly about this issue , thank you . </s>
Thank you , Jeff Madrick , and that concludes opening statements in this debate . I’m John Donvan , your moderator for this Intelligence Squared US debate , our motion is “Buy American-Hire American Policies Will Backfire , ” we have six panelists , three arguing for the motion and three against , now before the debate we polled our live audience here on where they stood on this debate , and I now have the results and we’ll report them and once again , the motion is , “Buy American-Hire American Policies Will Backfire , ” before the debate , 57 percent of you agree with the motion , 20 percent of you were against the motion , and 23 percent were undecided . We will poll you again at the end of the debate and the side that has moved the most votes , that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . </s>
Now on to Round 2 , in Round 2 , the debaters speak directly to one another , they can question one another , they will also take questions from us , myself and you in the audience will have the opportunity in just a minutes , we have ushers with microphones . If you raise your hand , catch my attention , we will get a microphone to you , I urge you again , please , to resist the temptation to make long speeches . And if you are a member of the press , we would prefer that you identify yourself . Doug Irwin of Dartmouth College , you are arguing for the motion that Buy American will backfire , you actually went as far as saying it has already backfired . I heard your opponent on the other side , Rick MacArthur , and his colleagues , argue repeatedly that Buy American works , and buy our own stuff works for lots of other countries who are doing it already , that’s why they do it . </s>
Rick MacArthur cited Mexico , it has worked for Mexico . If it works for Mexico , why not make the argument that it works here as well . Well I wouldn’t Grant the premise that it worked for Mexico , in fact , what did that lead to . Huge debt crisis in 1982 , huge collapse of the growing middle class , huge economic problems which is one reason why they chose to embrace economic openness after the early 1980s . </s>
But actually , Jeff Madrick raised an important point too . There’s been tremendous economic growth in India . </s>
Tremendous economic growth in China . </s>
The biggest change in the globe has been happening in those regions , where there’s hundreds of millions of people moving into the middle class . They’re able to do that because of trade openness . And yes— They’re able to do that because it’s a mercantilist policy , Doug . </s>
Oh , so China— They’re able to do that because they subsidize their market , they’re able to do that because they manipulate their currency . They’re able to do that because of the article that the CEO of— Chinese CEO of Suntech Power says that they’re going to sell their products in America , at lower than the cost of production . </s>
The issue— And they get away with it because— </s>
Excuse me , Leo . —bec—I’m not finished , let me— and they get— </s>
Well , I wasn’t finished either . Well— Well— I was told I could interrupt you when you were wrong , Doug . I’m glad Leo Gerard of the Steelworkers Union jumped in because one of the points that was raised by your opponents , as you argue against this motion , that Buy American will backfire , they raise the argument that , steel products from abroad may be better and may be cheaper , and why should Americans have to pay more for their steel if they can get it better and cheaper abroad . </s>
Well , first of all it’s certainly not better and in some cases it is cheaper , but I come back to the point that Doug raised about the Bay Bridge . We have red lead in steel , that we’ve had to ship back because , we banned red lead in America 30 years ago because of its health hazards . So we— Could—can you explain what that is for people that don’t know the term , very quickly— </s>
Red lead is the most toxic form of lead , they used to be put in pipes because it’s malleable . </s>
You can maneuver it . We banned it because red lead is so dangerous . And we pay a price for doing that , we pay a price for clean water , we pay a price for all those things in the kind of society that we want . We found that China was shipping steel pipes with radiation in it because they were doing it from melted pipes with radioactive material in it , and shipping it . </s>
We found that , as I said this , and I… But that—that’s an argument that you can buy junky stuff abroad . Well , that— And , — —well that’s—but Doug , there are , that’s the argument , that we have a set of laws and rules and we’re a rules-based trading system , but we’re the only one right now playing by the rules . </s>
You know , I— And , and if we’re a rules-based trading system they ought to be playing by the rules too— Let me hear from the side for the motion in response to that . </s>
Well— There’s nothing which prevents you from applying safety standards and we are doing that all the time . So the fact that some Chinese imports or any other imports , including our exports , get caught in the safety net doesn’t mean that Buy American is good . </s>
I mean that’s simply a non-sequitur . But what it does— The issue being—I’m sorry— —is that—what it does is it adds costs because we have rules , now you come to us and say , well your costs are higher . </s>
—Leo— But we have rules— —Le— </s>
—Susan Schwab— Leo , and I’m , and I would note , Doug never got a chance to finish what he was saying— I’m glad you’re standing up for him— I got that . </s>
No , I mean the point is , we can get off on this long tangent about Chinese trade policies , first of all , that is not the issue at hand . The resolution talks about Buy American policies , Hire American policies , will backfire . They will backfire , they have backfired , that’s what we’re voting about . But in terms of China , I have taken on Chinese trade practices , and we’ve got legislation to do that . </s>
We took six cases against the Chinese in the Bush administration , we won or settled every one of those cases , got rid of illegal Chinese subsidies , we managed to get the markets where they were artificially closing them . But— </s>
There are—I’m sorry . There are statutes for anti-dumping , there’s statutes for countervailing duties , there are lots and lots of statutes . Buy American legislation does not resolve any— But you’re not— —single one of— </s>
Jeff— —the issues , excuse me— And the problem with that is dumping— —but the other side’s been talking back— </s>
Jeff Madrick from the other side— Dumping goes on , subsidies go on in this recession , by all reports I’ve heard . China is really pushing out the exports as , uh , uh , as , and some of the practices are open , this is part of what I mean— This is what I’m talking about about this oversimplification . That , and I have great respect for…Jagdish who I consider a friend , but , to say that we can handle these issues in the International Labor Organization , or through agreements we make with China , disregarding the reality of the world , I am—we’re not even close to fighting a trade war . The , we’re—it’s not even close . </s>
China needs us , we need them , we’ve got to start dealing with the reality of what’s happened to wages in America . And Doug , things have become extremely imbalanced in this world you’re describing of China and India— Let’s let Doug Irwin in now— Extremely imbalanced— That’s great— </s>
—and in fact— </s>
Doug Irwin of Dartmouth College . I’m actually one of the few trade economists who believes the trade deficit has become a problem . So the question is how do you deal with it . Buy American will not deal with it , it’s not the right approach . Why do we have a huge trade deficit with China . </s>
What do we do with our dollars in the United States . 70 percent of US GDP is consumption . 70 percent . What is the share of consumption in China . 30 percent . </s>
They are a high-savings country , we are a low-savings country . We are a high- consumption country , they’re a low-consumption country . </s>
That is the ultimate source— Yeah— —of the trade deficit— —you know— It’s not unfair trade practices , it’s not all this other stuff— </s>
You know , one way to get to— We have to save more as a country , and China has to— I— —consume more . And—you know , and Doug is— </s>
Jeff , let me bring in your colleagues , we haven’t heard from them — </s>
As long as you give me a chance— No , sorry , Rick , Rick MacArthur , come on in . JOHN R. MacARTHUR Well , I never got to— I ran outta time so I wasn’t able to make my main argument which has to do with what kind of a country you want to live in . </s>
Obviously , using tariffs and Buy American provisions are artificial methods that you install in an economy to , we hope , maintain wages at a relatively high level so we can run a civilized society , we haven’t had one exchange yet about the exploitation of cheap labor in China or Mexico . And when I talk about when I have arguments with my friends in the economics departments of these various universities , I have to ask myself if they’ve ever met a factory worker , have they ever talked to a steelworker or to an autoworker or to an electrical worker who’s lost their job , because the United States has been pursuing pro-buy foreign policies for the last 15 years , that’s what we have now with NAFTA , and the Permanent Normal Trade Relations with China . These are , as Professor Bhagwati will be the first to acknowledge , preferential trade agreements , not free trade agreements , and , something has to be done on our side to compensate for these tremendous advantages , given to foreign manufacturers . Yes , some of it is low-end manufacturing but not all of it is low-end manufacturing . </s>
And in order to redress this tremendous trade imbalance there are various methods at our disposal . Tariffs , Buy American provisions , et cetera , et cetera . </s>
But to go on talking as if there is a free trade system in place that’s being threatened is preposterous . </s>
If you look at NAFTA and PNTR they’re much closer , and this is a corporate lawyer who first explained it to me when I explained to him how the labor market works between the United States and Mexico and the United States and China , it’s more like a labor racketeering agreement . That is a conspiracy to fix the price of labor as low as possible , certainly to benefit certain , uh , shareholders in certain American corporations , but not to benefit American workers or to defend— </s>
Rick , let— JOHN R. MacARTHUR —what we used to call the American way of life— </s>
I want to cut in— JOHN R. MacARTHUR If you want to keep driving wages down , yes , let’s keep pursuing a non-Buy American policy , and let’s— So , so— JOHN R. MacARTHUR —keep outsourcing— —so this critique seems to say to the side arguing for the motion that free trade as you describe it is a farce . </s>
Well , let us note again , you’re going to come back and remind everyone what this debate is actually supposed to be about , Buy American , Hire American . But , the other side is meandering , I want to go in that direction and talk about trade agreements because what Rick has been saying about trade agreements , just isn’t borne out by the facts . If you look at the free trade agreements , and , forgive me , Jagdish , I know you hate free trade agreements . If you look at the agreements that we’ve negotiated , you find that US exports to our trade agreement partners have gone up 40 percent faster , than our— JOHN R. MacARTHUR They are fake exports— </s>
40 percent— JOHN R. MacARTHUR Madam . —faster—fake exports ? Go talk to G.E . and Caterpillar— </s>
Jeff— </s>
—and , UPS— Soviet Union—Susan , Jeff , Susan , Jeff— Let me finish a thought— JOHN R. MacARTHUR Point of order , you got ta really— Let me—let me finish the thought— JOHN R. MacARTHUR You can’t say this . You can , you had— </s>
Well this is not true— like to respond— JOHN R. MacARTHUR Utter nonsense . I’ll let you respond— Let—let me just , let me just finish— </s>
I—I want in on this , okay— Do . I can say it because it is a fact and in fact if you just look at the trade agreements that we negotiated during the Bush administration US exports have gone up 80 percent faster to those countries than the rest of the world . NAFTA . NAFTA was raised , this—I know this debate’s not about NAFTA , but— And I didn’t negotiate NAFTA , NAFTA went through during the Clinton administration . </s>
But you know what ? If you look at the statistics in the 10 years before NAFTA and the 10 years after , you discover , that the 10 years after NAFTA passed , US unemployment was lower , US employment was higher , US economic growth was higher after NAFTA . So all of this , these scare tactics— Ohhh . </s>
—um , excuse me , do not… All right , your— </s>
—reflect reality— —your opponents are conferring and they want to speak , I first want to get the process of questions from the audience and I will come to that—you on that point , before we get to the questions , I just want to get it moving . </s>
If you raise your hand , I’d like to move a microphone over to you . If you go up the aisle , gentleman in the blue shirt , you will be next , I want to give you a chance to respond to what Susan Schwab just said— JOHN R. MacARTHUR Oh , very quickly the , you’ve heard the— Rick MacArthur— JOHN R. MacARTHUR —you’ve heard the expression industrial tourism I’m sure . The surge in exports from United States to Mexico are fake exports , it’s us sending components to Mexico for assembly , and we’re counting those as exports and they come right back into the United States for sale . </s>
We’re even at the point now where we’re , we’re sending oranges to Mexico to be packed , and then shipped back into the United States , we’re calling those exports , they’re fake exports , they’re not—there’s no added value to speak of in those exports . And the people who used to do those assembly jobs , those relatively low-paid assembly jobs , have lost their jobs . More than half a million , probably a million if we count honestly , since NAFTA was passed , and this is a government statistic . So , instead of having somebody making $ 10 an hour or $ 11 an hour packing oranges in Florida , it’s now being packed for $ 1.30 an hour in Mexico , we’re counting that as an export when it’s not an export . </s>
Leo Gerard , you’re— The— JOHN R. MacARTHUR It’s a phony export . Leo Gerard of the steelworkers— Two—couple of quick points . And I could give Susan the point that our exports have gone up , but our imports , more than doubled . </s>
So we—when we signed—we could do NAFTA . When we signed NAFTA we had a slight trade surplus with Mexico . 10 years after NAFTA we’ve had record trade deficits year after year with Mexico . When we did PNTR trade with China was relatively in balance , only a couple of hundred million dollars either way . We’re now setting record trade deficit with China , China’s trade deficit year over year , is 70 percent of our overall trade deficit . </s>
Today we have a— What—let— —manufactured— </s>
Let me finish— —let him finish , Susan . And the one thing that we were told , we need to get trained for these high-tech computer jobs , well you know what ? </s>
We’ve now got a deficit in advanced-technology products , so the high-end jobs that we were told we would train for are gone . National Association of Manufacturers has shown us— </s>
They’re the multi-national spokesmen— —that US trade balance with our FTA partners , is now in surplus— </s>

We’ve got a trade surplus , how did we end up with a trade deficit . AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) Thank you . Mr. Gerard . AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) As a Colombian manufacturer , I would be on the side of the protectionists…a hundred percent because if not , we’ll be run out of business . The fact is that one of the US manufacturers , with 1 percent of its yearly production , would run us out of the whole mark—of the whole Colombian market . </s>
So we think that it’s dangerous for us , and we think that the policy of subsidies does exist in the United States which it doesn’t in Colombia , and as such , I should be a protectionist . </s>
To be intellectually honest however— Sir , I need you to get to a question , please . With respect— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) Just very briefly , I have— </s>
It was—I really need you to get to the question— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) I have no doubt , that it’s good for our country to sign a free trade agreement . So , the question to , Mrs. , Trade Representative— Schwab , Susan Schwab— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) — , I’m sorry , is , why , if I think you believe that what I’m stating is true , why has it not been signed . Do I answer that now— Yes . </s>
The Colombia-US free trade agreement was , uh , signed over two years ago , three— close to three years ago now . It would benefit both countries , the independent International Trade Commission has told us that US exports would go up to Colombia , Colombia’s exports would go up to the United States . In fact , because Colombia has preferential access to the US market now , US exports would go up to Colombia even faster than Colombia’s exports to the United States , but Colombia would derive new foreign direct investment . We made all of these arguments on Capitol Hill . The Democratic leadership reached an agreement with the Democratic leadership in 2007 to add special labor and environmental protections to that agreement , after it had been signed and was very grateful that the government of Colombia was willing to incorporate that in the agreement . </s>
And lo and behold , the Democratic leadership in the Congress decided they just didn’t want to move the legislation . And a legislative process that has worked for the United States since 1974 , was turned on its head , when the Speaker of the House refused to allow a vote on the Colombia Free Trade Agreement when we knew the votes were there , in the House and in the Senate to pass it . </s>
In two sentences— John , can I— —what’s the lesson related to our motion tonight ? It—well , this— Perhaps none . </s>
The—well , I mean the , — Actually there is . It’s that— No , this is a— </s>
They’re right , there isn’t— Doug Irwin— —free trade in the world , because Colombia has very high tariffs against our goods , and we allow them duty-free access to our market . So it’s very much unfair and the Colombia FTA would’ve evened that play—leveled that playing field . I can answer that question now , sorry , now that I’ve thought about it—in terms of Buy American , here we’re talking about Buy American this , Buy American that . </s>
Our trading partners , Canada , Europe , are negotiating free trade agreements with Colombia , so that they can have preferential access and lock our guys out , that’s what’s happening— And not signing . Question from the— You know , I just have to cut in here because I’d love to hear Jagdish Bhagwati on bilateral trade agreements . And this may be a little too theoretical but bilateral trade agreements are anathema to true free-trade theorists for the most part . </s>
They do not— It’s not about comparative advantage . It’s about political bullying and political favoritism and all the FTA’s are going to do is exactly what Susan said they’re going to do . They’re going to bring in uncompetitive FTA’s , and we’re going to have a trade war in that sense , and I have the sense that— John , I just want to…go back to— Yeah , go ahead , Leo— </s>
—I want to go back to the point that I was cut off making , a minute ago . That , — </s>
Well— —when Susan made that point that all of the trading agreements that we’ve negotiated are all in surplus . No , no , that’s not what I said— I can’t make—I can’t do the math . That’s not what I said— </s>
We’re in fact running , a $ 6.5 trillion accumulated trade debt since 1994 . We’ve been setting record trade deficits year after year , and including in the last four years , a trade deficit in advanced-technology products . The— when we lost the industrial base of America , we lose the creativity and the innovation and the engineering all of the stuff that takes us to the next level . And right now we’re hollowed out to the point where , Jeff Immelt , that Susan referred to at G.E. , has now publicly said that we’ve gone too far with this , we’ve outsourced too much , and we’ve got ta go back and rebuild the manufacturing base and America needs an industrial strategy that will favor America . Jeff isn’t a left-wing trade unionist by any stretch of the imagination . </s>
Can I— He also doesn’t— I’m going to go up to the gentleman in the middle , and I really want to hear a question . AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) I have one… I would like to ask the question to the side that is arguing for the motion , do you—I’m right here . For the motion that Buy American will backfire . </s>
AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) Sorry—hi . I was wondering if you’re okay with the fact that the overwhelming majority of our economy is driven by consumerism . If you’re not okay with that , then wouldn’t it be a plus for us to then instill some sort of Buy American , Hire American policies . If that’s a no , then wouldn’t that lead to an economy that’s more reliant on consumerism , as it already is overwhelmingly . In the context of that , I’d like to say to Professor Irwin— </s>
I’m going to stop you there ‘cause I want it to be— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) —— —one question and you’ve actually got several clauses in there— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) No , no , in the context of that I would like— </s>
—I’m , I’m going to stop you , sir— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) —to say that you’re— Jagdish , can you take that question , please— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) I’m sorry , that , , also there’s— Um— Go ahead , go ahead . There’s somebody talking , I— ? </s>
Yeah , I’m asking him to— I don’t mean to be rude— Maybe he’s answering the question— </s>
—I just want to move it along and it was multi-part and it’s too complicated— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) Go— I couldn’t quite get at what exactly the , he was driving at . But let me just get back very quickly to Jeff Madrick’s question— —about free trade agreements , I totally disagree with what Susan said , I don’t know whether it’s kosher to disagree . But , I mean , the preferential trade agreements are between us as a major power , with little guys in different parts of the world , relatively except for South Korea . </s>
And if you look at any— Australia— ? —free trade agreement— Singapore— </s>
—it’s about that big , it consists of all kinds of atrocities being perpetrated on the smaller countries . And I think it pretends to be a trade agreement but is actually a trade—a non-trade agreement and I think , we need to get away from these altogether , and get back to the multilateral trading system . I think we have a— Another question from the audience— It— we apparently have a— </s>
—gentleman in the white shirt , please . Right behind you ? AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) I’ll try and keep it short . </s>
I believe that America’s a capitalist country , and capitalism rewards people who are more efficient , and people who can give you more for less . </s>
So , if these foreign countries can produce steel , like Pasco in Korea can produce steel better than US Steel or Nucor can , then why are we going to reward mediocrity , why are we going to reward the inefficiency of the American system , when we can get—when we should get incentives to the American companies to become as efficient as these foreign companies— Who— Let’s give that question to the Leo Gerard of the steelworkers— The problem with that question , is it’s living in facts that were probably from the 1970s and early ‘80s . And the fact is— </s>
—the—well… By the time we got to the economic collapse of last fall , last year…American steel was the cheapest of any major industrial country and American steel sold in America , was cheaper than Chinese steel sold in China . And the reason for that is that China doesn’t have sufficient raw material . </s>
But China went…think about this if we talk about a sort of a level playing field . From two thousand and three , roughly late 2002 , to 2007 , China went from being able to produce 150 million tons of steel , to 500 million tons of steel . </s>
In a traditional system using traditional finance , they could’ve never generated enough profits and they could’ve never accessed enough capital markets to make that kind of investment to do that to their industry , in a period of roughly five years . That was done because they got subsidies , they got cheap money , they got free land , they got no enforcement , they got free transportation , they got export subsidies , when they exported stuff to us they got the money back , and they generated that , and it’s a mercantilist system , I’m not angry at China— I would be— </s>
I’m not angry at China— I— —they decided to do that so they could grow their steel industry , we decided to punish our steel industry , and reward those that take jobs offshore with giving them tax breaks . </s>
It is… Okay , the side for the motion wants to respond to that— But we pay a lot of subsidies too— Jagdish Bhagwati— —at usually the state and local level . </s>
They are up to huge amounts , people like Mayor Bloomberg even announced with great glee that we managed to attract industry to New York , and all the governors compete for it also . So I think actually , we don’t have clean hands either , so you know , for us to say , others are subsidizing and we are not— I was just dealing with the steel question— —doesn’t make any sense— </s>
—he asked—he asked me a steel question , I don’t think we ought to subsidize each other at all . Okay , I want , I— JOHN R. MacARTHUR Can I just ask , what do you mean , capitalism is…who told you capitalism is efficient . What do , I’d like to hear him , may—could , you pretend you’re defending your doctoral thesis . And I’d be happy to argue that capitalism can be enormously inefficient , it can tend towards monopoly , it can tend towards monopolistic practices . We’ve just been through a supposed— </s>
I agree— JOHN R. MacARTHUR —boom— I agree— John , it’s a wonderful thesis question but we ought— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) Well , I really said that— Come on , sir , let’s move on— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) —is where we are— —to the— JOHN R. MacARTHUR And at what cost—at what cost— </s>

AUDIENCE MEMBER ( female ) We’re at NYU at the moment that happens to have a very modern little faculty , with global faculty , global students . And I think they know something . </s>
America is a big , complex influential place . It’s the epicenter of financial crisis , it’s in the middle of political and social change . And I think America needs to tell it to the world . I was wondering if the opposition have admitted from the start that they’re at most only half-right in this debate , or will they defend the Hire American policy . </s>
Are they— The question is were you— </s>
You know , I’m intri— —you’re , you’re not just talking about Buy American but Hire American— Yeah , I’m intrigued , you seem to think that that America— Jeff Madrick— </s>
—the implication of what you’re saying is that the credit crisis was somehow caused by people who don’t believe in market processes . The credit crisis was caused , I think , most believe people , or at least in large part , was caused , because of lack of government intervention , and because of the inefficiencies , and unfairness , of unfettered free markets . The free trade policies— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) You’re off the topic ! </s>
I’m not off the topic , that’s what she just asked— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) No she didn’t . </s>
Have some constraint and listen . Can I just— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( female ) Yeah— Jeff , you can take it . </s>
I believe you’re wrong , sir , and I’m going to continue . Okay ? But Jeff— The point is that we—America is responsible for much of that credit crisis , because it believed in free-market theory . </s>
Now , free trade theory , is a precise analogy to efficient market financial theory . It argues that all these markets in the world work very efficiently like this fellow has said . If Korea makes something efficiently why shouldn’t we reward them . Well , their wages are very low , but are they making something , are there more incentives , should we have an incentive battle ? So , are we—do we argue that , trade is good ? </s>
I think all three of us argue that trade is good . Do we argue that it’s become unbalanced , that this is tipped over far too much , that evidence of wages in America doing so poorly , is clear . That’s what I— </s>
Can I get back to the question ? Please do . Fair enough , fair call . Let me just say that , I’m myself an immigrant , okay ? I don’t think I’ve done much harm to this country . </s>
I think Mr. Gerard , a great…you know , description that you were a Canadian— </s>
I don’t think I’ve done much harm either— That you were a Canadian and I— Maybe you’ve done harm to this country but I— I think you should defend it yourself . But I do think , that this country as Susan , you know , eloquently pointed out has done enormously well , as a result of immigration . </s>
And I think— No , no— —to indulge in , you know— Listen , this is— </s>
—hiring aliens last , firing them first , the sort of movements which are going on , are extremely un-American and also extremely inefficient . We have really prospered on the… I mean— No , no , I want to— All right , Leo…Leo Gerard—take that on . </s>
I don’t know where this argument came from , that I don’t know anyone who’s against immigration .

That’s the argument— </s>

Well , I’m glad you say that— Jagdish Bhagwati— </s>
Yet . Uh— I hope you’re able to persuade others about— in this audience— when Intel , Bill Gates , et cetera , go out and get people from say India , the vast majority of those people are fantastically able , they’re trained at the best institutions— Absolutely— —in the country . </s>

—everywhere it’s the same , but , I would just say one thing . Which is that there are people , who could be employed but who are kind of at the bottom end , they’re not really comparable to the kinds of people we are going out and getting . And so I think the nation prospers by having those people come in , create jobs , because it’s not a given number of jobs that we are talking about . And I think the other people will find their own way , in jobs which are more appropriate to their qualifications— But that’s , that’s illegal immigration— </s>
And we’ll take another question from the gentleman who’s standing with the microphone— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) Yes . Let’s stipulate that the effect of impeding lower-cost goods , is higher prices for goods , tires , pickup trucks , et cetera , in fact that is the purpose of protectionist policies on their face is to , prop up prices , in turn , propping up wages . What is the—and this is the three gentleman on that side . What is the ethical— I just want to point out , you’re addressing your question to the team arguing against the motion— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) Okay , sorry , that’s right— </s>
—that Buy American will backfire— AUDIENCE MEMBER ( male ) Against the motion , that’s correct . What is the ethical justification , for transferring money from the broad American population , to workers in specific industries , which is again inarguably the cost of im— the effect of impeding lower-cost imports . The problem with your question , I’ll keep it short so that the others can get a chance . </s>
This is Leo Gerard speaking . The problem with your question is you don’t get to the point of how did we so-called end up with lower cost . </s>
If we end up instead of paying a living wage we’re paying less than a living wage , if we’re giving cheap money and extra subsidies , if we’re giving tax dollars to export credits when they export , if we’re not enforcing safety standards , if we’re not enforcing environmental standards , you could send me anywhere and give me those rules and I can develop the cheapest product . </s>
But what’s the moral right . And in this case what we’ve been doing , what we are doing today , is we’re taking American dollars , and we’re sending them to… could be Mexico , it could be somewhere else . We’re taking those American dollars and we’re sending ‘em over there , and they’ve cheated and haven’t played by the rules in a rules-based trading system that the three of us are arguing for , and they’re sending us back their products and their products are knocking our workers out of work . There’s a moral wrong being done there but it’s not by taxpayer dollars . </s>
That is the same kind of argument— </s>
Jeff Madrick— —that was used against labor unionization , throughout American economic history . What is the ethical argument for raising wages above some supposed , and I would argue hypothetical market rate of wages . The fact is , the assumption behind—and I see you smiling there . </s>
The assumption , behind your comment is that these markets work very well , reflect cost , that people without labor unions to continue that analogy , will always get what they’re worth , and everybody will do well . </s>
It’s just not unfortunately the way it works , it works maybe in your classroom . </s>
But it doesn’t work in the real world , and along— Can I—— And that concludes round two of our debate . Robert Rosenkranz , I just want to say , you moved this thing downtown and it really gets spicy . </s>
We’re now in the home stretch and in a very short time you , the audience , will be deciding who has won this debate . But I want to recall that at the beginning we asked you whether you agreed or disagreed with our motion that : Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire . At the beginning fifty-seven percent of you agreed with the motion . Twenty percent disagreed and twenty- three percent were undecided . In just a few minutes we’ll be asking you for a final time and your response is going to determine the winner . </s>
But first we want to start round three , closing statements . In this case , two minutes each for each speaker . Each speaker has a short summary statement . It’s their last chance to change your minds . Our motion , once again , is : Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire . </s>
And speaking against our motion and summing up , Leo Gerard , International President of the United Steel Workers . </s>
Leo . My point is ... My point will be very brief . </s>
That during the period of time that we’ve adopted the philosophy that the other side is defending – and you can’t defend that without talking about the issues of trade overall . And during the period of time that we’ve entered into that blind drive to that kind of a trade and investment ideology and manufacturing , America has gone from being the world 's largest creditor nation to the world’s largest debtor nation . Wages of average Americans have stagnated and fallen , that the industrial strength of America has gone from being sapped , uh , at twenty-eight percent at one time , now down to nine percent . </s>
We’ve had an accumulated trade debt that no one on the other side has tried to defend , of six and a half trillion dollars . Some of you in the room may know what a billion is . How many of you know what a trillion is ? Think about this : A billion seconds is roughly the nineteen ... late 1950s . </s>
A billion minutes ago , Christ was on earth . A billion hours ago we lived in caves . And in the period since 1994 we’ve accumulated a six and a half trillion dollar trade debt . </s>
We’ve hollowed out our economy to the point now where you’ve got the Chinese will probably raise at the G20 whether or not we should move to another form of currency because the American dollar is not sustainable . I think that the way we do that is we develop a strategy that’s going to rebuild the American industrial base and we have to do that by focusing , not just on subsidies but innovation , creativity and demanding that our trading partners level the playing field . And we’re not going to be able to win against unfair trade and we shouldn’t pretend we can . </s>
Leo Gerard , your time is up . Thank you very much . </s>
Summarizing for the motion : Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire , here is Douglas Irwin , Professor of Economics at Dartmouth College . Well , first of all , just in terms of the proposition before the house , I think they have backfired . I think that’s demonstrable . </s>
I think you have no choice but to vote affirmative . But let me make some major concessions to the other side . </s>
I think what you’re hearing is things we’ve heard in the 1980s . We’ve actually even heard them in the 1950s and beforehand -- and that is that economic change is very hard and very painful and we should do something to address that . </s>
I happen to think that the remedies they’re suggesting are wrong , will backfire and actually don’t really address the underlying problem . We’ve talked about the declining share of workers in manufacturing . Manufacturing is a victim of its own success . </s>
A century ago a third of the work force in the United States was in agriculture . Now it’s about two percent . Why ? Because the productivity of the American farmers is absolutely astronomical . </s>
The same thing has happened with American factories . They’re churning out stuff and we just need fewer workers . They’re much more capital intensive as productivity . Think about Manchester , New Hampshire . I’m from New Hampshire . </s>
If you’ve ever been to visit Manchester -- lovely city , huge brick building , over a mile long , former textile mill . Not a single shoe , not a single textile made there anymore . It’s a thriving city . </s>
It wasn’t always thriving and it went through some very difficult times . But it made that change . It had to . The jobs actually were stolen by the south , not by a foreign country . And then they left for the south for other countries . </s>
Jeff Madrick said , You know , I’m tired of hearing about people saying trade doesn’t , you don’t lose jobs . Actually , I’ll give you a copy of my book , because in one of the chapters I say , First thing , trade destroys jobs . </s>
Trade also creates jobs . </s>
But there’s no denying that trade destroys jobs and certainly in poor , competing industries . But it creates jobs elsewhere . The question is the balance . Guess what ? </s>
Technology destroys jobs . What’s happened to all the bank tellers ? What’s happened to all the secretaries ? Do we stop technology ? No , we have to adjust to it and become a better society for it . </s>
I do believe the trade deficit is a problem . But it’s not mercantilism of China or what have you . </s>
China is very poor but their savings rate ... What was the personal savings rate in the United States ? Douglas Irwin -- Zero . Douglas Irwin , your time is up . But they can save in China . </s>
Thank you . Summarizing against the motion that : Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire , John R. MacArthur , known as Rick MacArthur , President and Publisher of Harper’s magazine . </s>
JOHN R. MacARTHUR Very quickly , there are lots of anecdotal examples of de- automation in outsourcing , by the way , Professor Irwin , where products that used to be made on automated assembly lines in the United States are now being made by hand in Mexico and China . But I’ll put that aside and just say that I finally get to my main point , and get away from the statistics , and point out to you that Japan and China don’t believe in free trade any more than I do . And if we don’t start buying American soon or doing something , installing some kind of compensatory tariffs , Buy American provisions -- and I’ll acknowledge to the other side that the tariff such as it is has been corruptly applied throughout the decades and the centuries that we’ve had it . But that generally speaking , there has to be some kind of compensation for American policy that has favored the production of things that used to made here by cheap labor in foreign countries where you can not organize a union and you have no Environmental Protection Agency . But even if you don’t feel an ethical obligation to your fellow citizens or to the poor workers working for thirty cents an hour in China or a dollar twenty-five an hour in Mexico , even if you have no concern , ethical concern about them , I urge you to come over to our side , vote for our side out of enlightened self-interest . </s>
Because if we don’t do something to compensate for these pro- cheap labor , pro-outsourcing policies we’ve been pursuing for the last twenty years particularly -- but really since the war -- we’re going to end up with a political vacuum that will be filled not by a nice , civilized businessman like Ross Perot , but by a very ugly rightwing populist . It’s already brewing in the United States . And if you don’t hurry up and do something about it , there won’t be any discussion about free trade anymore . </s>
There’s going to be only discussion about how to shut the doors to immigration and how to keep the labor unions from organizing immigrants , for example . Thank , thank you , John MacArthur . Summarizing for the motion in this Intelligence Squared debate where our motion is : Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire , Jagdish Bhagwati , university Professor , Economics and Law at Columbia University . Let me first focus on Buy American provisions because that’s really what the motion is about . And there I would just simply say that while immediately you see that you’re saving some jobs , you’re losing many more because of the downstream effects , retaliation effects , diffusion or protectionism effects . </s>
By the time you’ve added it up , you’re losing far more than you’re gaining . And I think it’s just being penny wise and pound foolish . And that’s the fundamental point we need to understand . The second point relates to the more general issue of protectionism which has come up from the other side . </s>
I think certainly , Mr. Gerard , and I think to some extent , the other people on the other side , have been focusing on the fear that trade has actually putting downward pressure on the wages of our workers . </s>
As a Democrat , I’m certainly concerned about it and I think most people are concerned about it . I mean , these are the bottom thirty percent of our society and we ought to worry about them . The only question is whether protectionism is the answer . And I think what is going on basically is that massive technological change is going on , and I think we need to worry about that and how to adapt to that . </s>
And if we don’t do that we’re not going to get an , appropriate answer to the problem . You take acute technological change going on assembly lines . Entire assembly lines are wiped out . </s>
If you’re going to see , you know , take your child to see Charlie Chaplin’s Modern Times and they say that he goes berserk on the assembly line and they say , Can you take me to see an assembly line ? </s>
Well , you can but you won’t see Charlie Chaplin there . You will see five people in a cage up there . So what has happened is that large numbers of jobs have been lost and you’re getting more volatility as a result , for the unskilled workers . And we have to really rethink the whole issue of how we accommodate the institutional change to be able to support workers , but protectionism is not the answer . </s>
Thank you very much . Summarizing his position against our motion , Jeff Madrick , Senior Fellow at the Schwartz Center for Economic Policy Analysis at the New School . Jeff Madrick . </s>
Thank you . The first narrow motion , Buy American/Hire American will not have a reverse impact . </s>
It’s a rather small issue . What it will do is allow our stimulus to work effectively . That is our first priority . The way it’s now structured , our stimulus to get ourselves out of this recession , will leak badly overseas . That’s the principle issue . </s>
The opposition has talked about how it will inevitably cost jobs that use simple , people over there think it will save jobs in the near term . But if you thought about it for a second or two you’d realize there are second , third and fourth order effects . </s>
The fact is that both theory and most empirical studies suggest that more jobs are lost than the opposition is acknowledging . In fact , on balance the theory says a significant portion of jobs or wages are lost in this kind of situation . </s>
In balance , the whole wage package may be higher but the distribution of those wages changes . Now , free market theory is very compelling . It is a simple and pretty ideology . For the most part , the opposition has put forward this theory . </s>
And I think , judging by some of the questions , many of you believe it out there -- that efficient markets exist . </s>
I’m a little surprised I hear so much out there , given the financial crisis because we were told time and again that bonuses made sense , that securitization made sense , that even some people -- like Alan Greenspan , and to some degree , Ben Bernanke -- told us high house prices make sense . They resorted to the same kind of thinking that is behind this idea that we just let markets work and sort it out . </s>
The way to respond to change is through active government working with business , active incentives . And this kind of argument has diminished our ability to do that in America . </s>
Thank you , Jeff Madrick . And finally , speaking for the motion : Buy American/Hire American Policies Will Backfire , here is Susan Schwab , former U.S. trade representative . But the other side has sort of been bobbing and weaving about the topic on the debate . </s>
So I’m forced to address just a couple of issues here on the ethics of open trade . </s>
The fact that there have been six hundred million people brought out of poverty in China and India , in part because they have opened their markets over the last two decades , I think is a very strong positive note , how important trade can be and they’re potential new customers of ours . We remain the single largest manufacturer in the world . We want to be selling those turbines , those earth movers , that transportation equipment , the aircraft . </s>
It’s very , very important . And we care as much about U.S. jobs as the other side . </s>
However , not a single solitary one of the arguments that they have made would create a single job . And in fact , if you look at the proposition here , the proposition here would destroy -- Buy American/Hire American policies we have been able to show , without question -- would destroy more jobs than it would create . It sounds patriotic . </s>
In fact , Buy American/Hire American policies hurt America , hurt Americans . </s>
There is zero evidence of any country ever using economic isolationism and buy national policies to achieve and sustain economic development . </s>
Someone mentioned Japan . </s>
I remember twenty years ago , thirty years ago these same folks were telling us the Japanese were going to wipe out all our manufacturing . We are still , by far , the largest manufacturer in the world . We are the largest exporter in the world . </s>
There are millions of U.S. jobs that depend on these exports and that includes exports that we can and should and will be making to foreign countries that have stimulus packages . Clearly , the vote has to be on which side has convinced you that the policies will create more jobs and more opportunities for Americans . </s>
Clearly , that is a vote in the alternative because Buy American policies have and have already failed . Thank you , Susan Schwab . </s>
And that concludes the debating portion of our program . It is now time to learn who has won this debate . </s>
We want to ask you to take out your cell phones again and turn them on , briefly . It works the same way as before . </s>
You text to the number 99503 . For the motion you vote IQYES . </s>
If you’re against the motion you vote IQNO . If you remain undecided or became undecided , you vote IQUNDECIDED . And I’ll give you a couple of minutes cause I hear the phones just starting up . </s>
The instructions are clear to everyone , I assume . </s>
Yeah . Is anyone not done ? All right , a lot of people still . </s>
Okay . What’s happening ? It says you already voted ? </s>
Is anyone else having that problem , that it’s coming back to you that you voted already ? </s>
Sorry ? It said to call back , leave a message ? </s>
Yeah . All right , and if you can shut your cell phones down again . To the individuals -- and I think it’s just a few -- for whom it’s glitching , we apologize . We will smooth it out . Okay ? </s>
So Dana , I’m assuming we’re locking it out ? </s>
Okay . Voting is over . So we’re going to have the vote in just a moment . </s>
But before we do so , first of all , once again , this was a very zesty conversation . I really want to thank both , Looking forward as series four continues , I want to point out that our next debate will be next month -- Tuesday , October 6th . The motion will be : America Can not and Will Not Succeed in Afghanistan and Pakistan . We are still booking this , . </s>
and here’s who we have booked so far : Panelists for the motion are retired U.S. Military Intelligence and Army Special Forces Officer Patrick Lang and Ralph Peters , a retired Army Officer and author ; against the motion are President of the New America Foundation and author of The Bin Ladens , Steve Coll . And he is one of the authors of the U.S. Army’s Counterinsurgency Field Manual , Retired Officer and President of the Center for a New American Century , John Nagl and former Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asia , James Shin . All of our debates will continue to be heard on more than a hundred and ninety NPR stations across the country and to that point , when I announce the final results , the second vote results , I’m going to raise my hand and ask you to applause to give us a rousing conclusion to our radio broadcast . But we are also on television throughout this season , on Bloomberg Television . You can watch all of the fall debates on Bloomberg and read about them also with our other partner , Newsweek . </s>
The results of this debate and the content of the debate will be summarized and analyzed in the next edition of Newsweek . Books by tonight’s panelists and DVDs of past debates are on sale in the lobby but Jeff gets a free one from Doug , right ? MAN That would be unfair . </s>
Ah heh . MAN I should have read it , though . </s>
All right , is everybody settled down ? And I have the results in and our concluding numbers are these : When you came in and voted beforehand , fifty-seven percent of you were for the motion , twenty percent of you were against and seventy-three percent were undecided . After the debate , seventy-two percent are for , fourteen percent against , fourteen percent undecided . The side arguing for the motion wins . </s>
Congratulations to that team . Thank you for me , John Donvan , for Intelligence Squared U.S . > > END TAPE . </s>
< < Let’s welcome our debaters to the stage , we’re about to begin . And if you look at the current issue of Newsweek there is an op-ed piece on the topic of the health care debate that is by our founding chairman , Robert Rosenkranz , pick it up and read it , it’s worth it , and at this point I’d like to introduce Robert Rosenkranz , ladies and gentlemen . Well thank you very much and welcome to this evening’s debate . </s>
Well , I assume we’re mostly New Yorkers here , and we all know that New York has its problems . But California’s are worse , or at least so New Yorkers like to believe . </s>
California has Hollywood , Silicon Valley , and way better weather . </s>
But California’s credit rating is lower than ours , New York State legislators can look at the California legislature , and come away with delusions of adequacy . </s>
The political divide between San Francisco liberals and Orange County conservatives , is actually more acute than ours . </s>
And in California it takes two-thirds of the legislature to impose taxes . Which virtually assures recurring budget crises . </s>
California’s experiment with direct democracy , the referendum system , has demonstrated that voters like to receive benefits from the state , but don’t like to pay for them . A result , I suspect , you are shocked , shocked to learn . </s>
With a looming $ 20 billion budget gap , and 1 percent of the taxpayers already footing 50 percent of the bills , will California be able to squeak by ? Or will it become the Lehman Brothers of state government ? Will a vibrant private sector bail out its mismanaged state sector . Or is California our first failed state . </s>
And let me emphasize the “first” in this proposition . </s>
Are its problems the result of a uniquely dysfunctional political culture , or are they the harbinger of things to come , to a big- spending , highly-taxed state , close to home . </s>
With that , we have a terrific panel who I think will shed some light on these questions and it’s my pleasure now to turn the evening back to John Donvan and our panelists tonight . Round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz , please , thank you . Well , hello everyone , and welcome to another debate from Intelligence Squared US , I’m John Donvan of ABC News , and once again , it is my pleasure to serve as host and moderator , as the six debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . Six debaters , three against three , will be debating this motion— “California is the First Failed State.” </s>
Now , I want to point out that this is a debate , it’s not a symposium or a seminar , it is a contest . These two teams are here to win . And you our audience serve as our judges , by the time the debate has concluded you will have been asked to vote twice , once before the debate and once again after . </s>
Vote on whether you agree with the proposition , “California is the First Failed State , ” or whether you vote against it . At the end of the debate the team that has changed the most minds , will be declared our winner . So let’s go to the preliminary vote , if you look to the right arm of your seat , there’s a keypad… numbered 1 through 0 , only pay attention to keys number 1 , 2 , and 3 , if you agree with the motion , “California is the First Failed State , ” press number 1 . If you disagree press number 2 . If you are undecided , press number 3 , and if you make a mistake just correct yourself and the system will lock in the last key that you pressed . And I’m gathering from expressions that everyone has completed this . </s>
No one needs more time ? Okay . And so to Round 1 , opening statements by each debater in turn . Seven minutes each . </s>
Our first debater speaking for the motion , “California is the First Failed State , ” Andreas Kluth , who is The Economist’s West Coast correspondent . </s>
He covers politics , society , and the economy in California and the western states , he spent a long time working out of New York . Having made the move to California , Andreas , I understand in your office you work from a yoga mat . </s>
Is this is not the influence of California , on— On a tatami mat , in the lotus position , that’s true . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Andreas Kluth— I’m willing to prove it . Thank you . </s>
California is the first failed state , and most of you probably believe that already . Which is a tactical disadvantage for us on this side , but if you do , we want to keep your vote . For the rest of you , we’d like to convince you of that this evening . </s>
And , before I start doing that , I just want to clear away something that might be confusing . </s>
The proposition is cheeky , as all of you know , all good Oxford-style debates start with a cheeky proposition . The reason this one is cheeky , is that “failed states” usually refer to sovereign states . Somalia , Sudan , Yemen , Haiti . </s>
And what those have in common , is that they have lost a monopoly on legitimate violence , if you think that through , or maybe back to Poli . </s>
Sci . When that happens , warlords take over or maybe Somalian pirates , and the state as such loses authority , well clearly , no one on the stage tonight is going to argue in the next two hours that California is already ruled by warlords or pirates . So what are we talking about when we talk about one of the 50 states , domestic states . We have to agree to a working definition to make this interesting . </s>
California and other domestic states that may follow have failed , if they fail to support their citizens and instead hinder them . </s>
What’s another way of saying that is , if a state , if the governance part of the state as opposed to private industry , can no longer address or solve the problems it faces , then it has failed . </s>
California easily meets those criteria . And I just want to quickly because that timer is running already , run down some of the problems to remind you , maybe we can go into them later in depth . </s>
Prisons , California has the worst recidivism rate in the country , how did it get like that . Water , it’s an infrastructure and a climate issue but it’s also a political , a governance issue . </s>
Education . Before California became a failed state in the Pat Brown era of the ‘50s and ‘60s it built the best public university system in the country , it is currently dismantling that because it is now a failed state . Budgets . </s>
And a state is supposed to have a budget , to pass it on time , California never does , that started well before the recession . California—or states are supposed to pay their bills to their vendors and so forth , as all of you know , probably all of you know , California has been paying with I.O.U.’s . Courts . I asked Ronald George , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , whether he thought it was a failed state , he could say you could argue that , if the state no longer administers justice because its courts are closed part of the time , and dockets of cases is backlogged . California has the worst credit rating of the 50 , you know that , it was just lowered again by S & P . </s>
Our opponents may try to convince you tonight that this has something to do with the Great Recession , and that as soon as there’s a recovery these problems will recede . It’s not true , all of you have heard Warren Buffett say it’s only when the tide goes out when you learn who’s swimming naked . </s>
California has been undressing since the 1970s , I hope to get into that . I argue that it’s been stark naked since the ‘90s , and indeed , the tide has just now gone out with the Great Recession but that’s not something that happened overnight , the failure that is , the nakedness . </s>
It’s just been revealed . Our opponents may also argue that California has problems , but all states have problems , as Mr. Rosenkranz reminded you here . And that that does not amount to failure , that’s not true , that’s not appropriate in the case of California , because only one state has all problems simultaneously . And when you have all problems simultaneously you tie them together into a straitjacket and that’s what California is in , it’s in a straitjacket , because of its governance structures . I want to develop that in the time that remains right now a little bit , and then hopefully go deeper into it later in the evening to show to you what the unique aspect of that confluence is . </s>
Unique number 1 . Three states , for example , have the super-majority requirement that both houses of a legislature have two-thirds votes to pass a budget , three states . Arkansas , Rhode Island , and California , nothing unusual yet . </s>
16 states have the same super-majority required to raise taxes . </s>
Only one state has both . How did California— California is that state . How did California get that second super-majority requirement . It was the infamous Prop 13 , I understand it’s famous even on this coast…1978 when they started undressing . It is part of something called direct democracy that the founders of the nation , as opposed to the state , were very skeptical and afraid of—about , afraid of . </s>
It includes initiatives , referenda and recalls . 24 states have initiatives , have direct democracy . </s>
Only one does not allow its legislature , to amend initiatives that its own voters have passed , no matter how insane . Only one state , only one state has the process , has really run certifiably amok , out of control , insane , in only one state , do the inmates run the asylum . </s>
Tonight , you may hear that California , this usually comes up , has great weather . You may hear about its beautiful redwoods , Yosemite’s gorgeous . You may hear about the vibrancy of Silicon Valley which I used to cover . All that is true , it’s all irrelevant . Because we’re not talking about whether or not the state has assets . </s>
Whether or not there are some good things in the state . Of course there are . </s>
We’re talking about whether the state as such , the structures that make the state , the governance structures , have failed , and indeed they have , and the other states must be very careful unless they have the same unique—the same combination of problems that put them in the same straitjacket , and also lead to failure . Our opponents are great orators…don’t let them confuse you tonight… I’ll be back in a little , in a few minutes , but for now just remember what the definition of a domestic failed state is , remember to stay on our side , stay on our side , you probably are there already . California is the first failed state . </s>
Thank you , Andreas Kluth . Our motion is “California is the First Failed State , ” you’ve heard the first opening statement in support of the motion , now to speak first against the motion , I’d like to introduce Gray Davis , the 37th governor of California who happens to be like me , Bronx-born . Anybody else ? Oh , a lotta hands , lotta hands . Governor , you can start heading for your lectern . </s>
Governor Davis encountered direct democracy head-on-head when he lost a recall election in 2003 , but prior to that he had won almost every election he had ever run in as he served as State Controller and as Lieutenant Governor . He is , though Bronx-born , a true Californian , ladies and gentlemen , Gray Davis . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , John , I’m thrilled to be back in New York , as John said I was born here , many of my relatives are here , actually most of my relatives . I graduated from Columbia Law School . And not to be undone , NYU sent me two graduate students to help me get reelected in 2002 , so . I’m fond of New York , I think I have a sense of how New Yorkers think and I think a lot of you probably voted that California is the first failed state , so my hope is that I can impress you with what is right about California , and why it’s already an asset to the nation , and will be more of an asset as we move forward in this global society . First let me acknowledge that there are problems in Sacramento…but the shortcomings of our elected officials should not detract from the creative contributions of our 37 million citizens . </s>
Our GDP which is one way we measure societies in this world , is $ 1.9 trillion , far and away the largest in America . </s>
Larger than Russia , larger than India , larger than Canada . </s>
In fact the eighth largest in the world . </s>
And if we were a separate country , we would be a member of the G8 . So one way we measure societies in a capitalistic world , is by their GDP and certainly California has no apologies for that . </s>
I’m also pleased to see that a recent edition of Time magazine agreed , and was very bullish on California . It titled its piece , “California is Still the American Dream , ” and I quote : “It is”— “it” meaning California— “is the cutting edge of America’s future . It is the greenest , most diverse…most global…and most Asian-oriented society at a time when the world is moving in all those directions . </s>
It is an unparalleled engine of innovation , a Mecca of high-tech , biotech , and now clean-tech . In fact , from 2006”— and I’m still quoting—“2006 to 2008 , it received 60 percent of all the clean-tech investments in this country , and in 2008 it received more venture capital funds than the other 49 states combined.” With all of its problems it still managed to nurture some of the most innovative companies in the world , Google , Apple , Hewlett-Packard , MySpace , Facebook , Twitter , YouTube , Cisco , Intel , Disney , eBay , and many other companies that are helping invent the future for California and for the— for America . California is all about change . </s>
It likes to get there first , and it frequently does , it was the first state to regulate greenhouse gases . It was the first to allow full-scale stem-cell research . It was the first to establish renewable energy portfolio standards . What do I mean by that . It said to its utilities , use renewable energy . </s>
Depend less on fossil fuel . </s>
As governor I was proud to sign all those bills into law , but prouder still , to be part of a 35-year tradition of promoting energy efficiency and energy conservation . </s>
Now why am I talking about this . Because , the green economy is the next great wave in the American economy . We have to be green , we have to be reorienting the grid , we have to live more lightly on the planet if we are going to compete globally . </s>
35 years ago , during the first energy crisis , California decided , if it wanted to promote conservation , it has to give the utilities a financial incentive to permit that . So it said to the utilities , you can make more money if you encourage your customers to consume less . And ever since then , we’ve been regulating everything that uses electricity , from appliances , refrigerators , dishwashers , homes , all kinds of businesses , cars , and even lately flat-screen TVs , and along the way , we saved rate-payers $ 56 billion , and avoided building 24 new power plants . </s>
In fact , our electricity growth has been nada , zippo , zero , over 30 years , as we became the largest state in America -- the rest of the country is more than 50 percent . Why do I tell you that ? </s>
Because how America obtains energy in the future , will be critical to our economy , our environment , and to national security . And I submit to you that California’s proven leadership in this area over the last 35 years , will stand this nation in very good stead . Now to be sure , we have problems in Sacramento , but believe me , the voters have tuned in to this issue , and they have already made change that’s substantial . </s>
For many years the legislators drew their own districts , meaning they decided in what district they would run , they decided you would be in my district , you would not . And so not surprisingly , they almost never lose . Governor Schwarzenegger proposed a redistricting plan , it passed , I supported it because I believe it’s time the voters draw the line , not the people , and it’s time we bring accountability to Sacramento , that will kick in in 2012 and that will make a big difference . Now voters get punished if they react harshly towards their core constituencies , Republican- raised taxes , they have all kinds of recall attempts against them , Democrats punish the teachers , there’s a primary opponent next time . </s>
Under a redistricting plan , if you don’t solve the problem , you will get defeated . Similarly in June there is an open primary…a change I predict California will embrace , I support it , I’m the only governor elected in an open primary , the Supreme Court of the United States struck it down , but they have approved this version . It’s essentially a municipal election . If anyone can vote , independents , Republicans and Democrats , and you can vote for a Republican for governor or a Green Party for governor or a Democrat for governor . </s>
The top two vote-getters run off in the general election , even if they’re from the same party . That’s going to produce pragmatic , moderate problem-solving candidates . Finally there’s a call for a constitutional convention . I support that idea . </s>
It’s time we eliminated in my judgment the two-thirds vote requirement to pass a budget . Yes , we have a two-thirds vote requirement to pass a budget , and a separate one to pass the budget . Just that requirement to get a two-thirds vote to pass a budget is the reason we are always late , it’s ridiculous , only three other states have it . I think that’s the kinda thing a constitutional convention will change , and if the changes are , are sensible , the voters will accept it . </s>
So in short , our private sector is the envy of the world , and innovation will lead America , into a future that is brighter and stronger . Our public sector is on the mend and will get better at the end of 2010 . Vote no , number 2 , vote no . Thank you , Gray Davis . </s>
Our motion is “California is the First Failed State , ” and up now to argue for this motion , to argue that California is the first failed state I’d like to introduce Sharon Waxman , who has a long and distinguished career working for the New York Times and the Washington Post both as a foreign correspondent and as a reporter covering the entertainment industry from the inside out , she’s written books about it . She has started a Web portal on the entertainment industry known as The Wrap.com , and though you are arguing that California’s a failed state you believe enough to base your business there . Am I right about that ? Yeah , I like the weather . Okay . </s>
It makes sense , ladies and gentlemen , Sharon Waxman . </s>
So before I get going I just want to know if Gray Davis’s relatives are going to get to vote this evening ? If they’re filling half the room . I come to you tonight as a mother , as an engaged citizen , and as a journalist who has covered California for the past 15 years . </s>
So let’s start with the area I know best that I deal with every day and that’s Hollywood . </s>
Hollywood , the symbol , a signature of California . Part of the dream of what California represents . And a symbol of course to the world of California’s industry , creativity , prosperity , and the values of American culture . </s>
Here’s the only problem with that . Hollywood’s not really in Hollywood anymore . It’s gone to New Mexico , and Arizona , and New York , and Vancouver , and London . So Avatar , the movie that is now breaking all the box-office records was really filmed in New Zealand . And Twilight , that series that all your kids , all your daughters are going to see was filmed in Vancouver , and Harry Potter , that series of extremely successful movies was filmed in London . </s>
So the people who run the industry , which is a fairly small number of people , they still live in Brentwood and Bel Air and Beverly Hills and places like that but the hundreds and thousands of jobs that produce this , juggernaut of—not just of jobs but of tax revenues to the state , has largely fled , film production is down to half of what it was in California in 1996 . This is the way things are going , and the reason for me it has a lot to do with California failing to create a sense of connectedness with this incredibly core industry , it’s so much of what we ought to be proud of , by the way of course the entertainment industry is one of America’s top exports , not only California . </s>
But it doesn’t feel like that there is a connection between what the state represents , and the identification that we have with Hollywood and that vast entertainment industry , with the state , and why is that . </s>
It seems to me that the state has neglected it as it has neglected so many things . And that goes to me to sort—one of the , one of my big observations about living in California especially after having lived around the world for much of the beginning of my adult life , is that there isn’t that sense of connectedness , as a community . And the state plays a big role in that . Where we live in California , is largely in gated communities , with private security , we live in isolation , and this is nothing new , we all know that . People , you can go to a place like Koreatown which has the largest ethnic community of Koreans outside of Korea , 800,000 people . </s>
That community feels extremely Korean . </s>
They feel extremely connected to the country of their parents’ birth or of their birth or of their ancestors . I don’t think they feel Californian . And I think that that’s true of so many of the ethnic groups that have come to live in enclaves in California . </s>
I see that as a failure of the state to create that sense of identity among them . Here’s another big thing that bothers me . </s>
People who know me know that this is my pet peeve . The state has not provided an infrastructure that allows us to be a community , and community is all about what the state is there to protect , and preserve , and to nourish . So I can’t tell you how many times I have driven up to the edge of the 10 freeway from where I live in Santa Monica , peered over the railing , hoping to go to a Lakers game , or to visit a museum , or to go visit Disney Hall for the first time which I would have never succeeded in doing when they were actually playing a concert , and , dared to jump into that essential parking lot of the 10 freeway . That’s because , there isn’t a transportation system that works . We are essentially a city that sits on the roads , and that we have of course made a decision not to have a public transportation of any significance , and the roads are long- neglected and the state has not invested in them , to me , that is , as a member of -- somebody who wants to participate in the community , I feel I can’t get to the community , and that to me is a failure of the state . </s>
Finally , I want to speak to you as a mother . I’m the mother of three children . And I moved my family from Europe actually , to raise them in California , and we all , all of us in our family , my husband and I and kids who were then small , were aware of what it meant to go pursue the California dream . </s>
That dream has really turned out to be one that we have to create for ourselves . We came from Europe where public transport was something that was a given . Medical care was a given , education was a given . </s>
At the very least , I knew that coming to California , that I was moving to a state that had the best public university system in the country , if not the world . </s>
Today , that system has been , I feel , taken away from us . Because of the problems with the state , they just , again , you probably all read about it , raised the fees some 30 percent in the UC system , and , they’re now approaching the fees of a private university , it now costs about the same to go to UCLA Law School—my son the lawyer , I’m just still hoping— as it is to go to a private law school . How is it that the state is abdicating its role in creating a generation of the best and the brightest in the state of California , which was all about what California represented . So…all of this together , leads me to say to you , that California is a failed state . I commend the governor on all of the changes that he’s laying out as hoping to come to California , and , as an entrepreneur having started The Wrap.com , </s>
I can tell you that there are wonderful companies there—and I chose to start my company in California , however , that doesn’t mean that that is because the state encourages us to do so or allows us to do so , that is a testament to the innovation that the citizens and the residents of California have shown . It is not proof that the state has not failed . And so I would like you to vote for the proposition that California is the first failed state . It has neglected its fundamental industries , it has neglected its fundamental functions , and it has neglected its fundamental values as a state . Thank you , Sharon Waxman . </s>
Thank you , Sharon Waxman . Okay , a reminder of where we are , we are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared US debate , I’m John Donvan of ABC News , we are listening to opening statements from each side . We have six debaters , two teams of three and they are fighting it out over this motion , “California is the First Failed State.” </s>
Now on to our next speaker against the motion…I’d like to introduce Van Jones , Van Jones was the founder , co-founder of the Ella Baker Foundation for Human Rights and Green for All . He was part of the Obama administration as special advisor for green jobs , he resigned that position after being targeted in a nasty political imbroglio , but his standing in the greenest state in the nation is enormously high in the green movement , and Van , I saw on Facebook only today , a “Draft Van Jones for Governor” page ? Would… Would you want the job ? Well , I—it would be and I’ll tell you this . One of the—I’m not running , but— Be an honor to serve butt -- and I’ll tell you why , first of all , California is not a failed state and our colleagues have pretty much conceded that they can not win this argument based on the assertion that it’s a failed state so instead they point to some failings . </s>
But what they haven’t told you is that every single one of the problems—structural and otherwise— that have been pointed to you , have solutions , and the solutions are now on the way . </s>
We have in our state… We are the biggest state—we have some of the biggest problems—we also have the biggest potential for problem solving , and the largest number of problem solvers . So every one of the structural problems that has been pointed out—from redistricting to the tax issues , to the budget issues—have gathered the combined wisdom across the political spectrum , there are now ballot measures moving forward , there are solutions for these problems . To say that California is a failed state is different than saying it has some failings . We have some serious failings , but we also have a set of assets , that our friend was trying to make sure you didn’t pay attention to , that will help us solve these problems . </s>
First of all , when you look at a state like California , you look at a state that , on the three critical issues that are most important for our country , California is not failing—it is succeeding and it is leading . What are the three critical issues ? Number one , how will we power America , as the governor just talked about . </s>
How will we power this country ? Will we continue to rely on the post well oil strategy that we have been stuck in , with petroleum and coal for 100 , 150 years now—it’s the post whale oil strategy—we’ll continue with that ? Or will , will we innovate our way out ? </s>
Will we invent and invest our way out ? In California , that is what we are doing . </s>
In a failed state , capital does not flow in—capital flows out . In California , we have quadrupled—in the past two years— the amount of venture capital flowing into the state , because we are trying to solve the biggest problem humanity faces : the problem of global warming , and the biggest problem our country faces : the problem of energy independence . </s>
California is leading and succeeding in that . We just attracted a company , Electric Vehicles International , to come and build zero emission cars in California . They could have gone anywhere in the world . </s>
They came to California because of the policy certainty , because of the consumer demand , because we are on the front edge . </s>
We have policies in place passed—despite all the problems with our legislature—we have passed on a bipartisan basis with a Republican governor…a Democratic legislature , AB 32 , our Global Warming Solution Act , which will drive the creation of 400,000 clean and green jobs . We have set high aspirations with regard to renewable energy . Possibly , as many as three-quarters of a million jobs that will be created there . </s>
15,000 jobs right now in solar , in the solar industry , and growing . A failed state doesn’t do that . That is not a failed state . Number two yes , Sacramento has a ton of problems . Help is on the way . </s>
Great ideas are on the way . But the entire State of California did not live in Sacramento . We have an incredible level of innovation at the governance level , cities , and regionally across the state , because the second big problem is—how are going to live together in cities ? How are we going to live together at a community level ? Can we solve problems ? </s>
You see in California , problems are being solved every day—tough problems . Look at the problems with the port of Los Angeles—just to brag a little bit on the people of California—where the pollution was so bad that little kids who live close to the port of Los Angeles were getting asthma and dying , and people said that we can’t solve this problem because of the logjams and all the special interests . </s>
They got together , they sat down , they came up with a Clean Truck Program that helped lift the living standards of 10,000 truckers . </s>
Got new technology in those trucks on the roads , and took asthma inhalers out of little girls’ and little boys’ pockets . That is the kind of problem solving that’s going on at the local level . In Fresno , you have a wonderful new mayor , Ashley Swearengin , who has been able to pull people together in the agricultural heartland of our state , and create 19,000 new jobs , through a regional economic initiative . In Northern California , you have mayors like Gavin Newsom , Ron Dellums and others who had come together , who have come up with local creative financing to get green home improvements going , weatherization and solar panels attached to property taxes so people can actually get all these new technologies going . And these are the kinds of things that are happening on a daily basis . </s>
And those things don’t happen in a failed state . In a failed state , when things are tough , people turn on each other . In California , people are turning to each other , and working together across lines of class and color . And the last thing I want to say is that the , the third big challenge for this country and for this world is—how are we going to live together ? </s>
In the age of this kind of diversity , how are we going to live together ? There is a miracle every single day in California , a miracle . </s>
And it’s a miracle of cooperation . In Oakland , California , there are 30 to 40 different languages spoken in the public schools—30 to 40 different languages spoken in the public schools . </s>
To the extent that there is conflict—it’s not about that…it’s not about that . We have been able to figure out a way to come together , to work together . That is not just a good example for the United States…that’s a good example for the world . </s>
There is no place in the world that has the kind of diversity and density that we have…that manages to do it with elegance , that manages to do it successfully . And when you have a state where 20 years ago there was a conflagration over race and ethnicity—people remember Los Angeles 20 , almost 20 years ago . </s>
Somebody stood up and said , “Can’t we all get along ? Can’t we all get along ? ” Californians have answered that question—yes we can , yes we can get along— and we do it every day . And it’s out of that community of many colors , many classes , with every faith , every sexuality , working together on a daily basis , that great solutions have come in our economy , have come in local governments , and are now coming from our state governance . </s>
This is not a failed state . We have some failings , but this state is a state that is now rallying to solve those problems . Don’t vote against us , vote for us . </s>
Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you , Van Jones . </s>
Our motion is , “California is the First Failed State.” </s>
And now to argue for that motion , to argue that California is the first failed state , I would like to introduce Bobby Shriver , who is a councilman in Santa Monica and co-founder of One.org , and a scion of one of America’s greatest political families , ladies and gentlemen , Bobby Shriver . Thank you very much . I also want to put in a plug for Red , which I started also with my great colleague , Bono , my partner—which I always like saying . </s>
Because most of my life , people have been saying other things about me . I was President Kennedy’s nephew . When my dad started the Peace Corps , I was Sergeant Shriver’s son . When my mom started the Special Olympics , I was Eunice Shriver’s son . And then a terrible thing happened in our family—my sister went on national television and became the host of the CBS Morning News . </s>
So four brothers , very competitive Irish family , were faced with the prospect that we were going to be known forever as Maria Shriver’s brothers . </s>
So we had a meeting—what could we do about it ? And we had various ideas , none of them very good . </s>
And at one point , one of my brothers said , “Well , face it , you know , it’s done , and it can’t get any worse.” And then Maria got married . So , I love it when I go and see in the program that I am Bono’s partner , because I am really tired of being Arnold Schwarzenegger’s brother-in-law . </s>
I appreciated our eloquence of some of our colleagues , but I want to point out very , very specifically that all of the answers are on the way . </s>
They are not here now . And I can tell you in local government , where I serve on the City Council in Santa Monica , that things are bad . We are lucky in Santa Monica because we have a great , diverse tax base . </s>
But just to give you a couple of illustrations… Our redevelopment agency had a budget this year of 30 million dollars—the state took 22 million of that . How can you work on that basis ? And this is a reminder also , that when you talk about the state , you are not talking about Google and Intel…and you are not talking about local government…you are talking about the state government . It’s very important . </s>
The state is a constitutional entity , it’s a legal entity . It’s not California . When Steve Jobs writes on every Apple product , “designed in California , assembled in China , ” he is not talking about designed in the State House of California…he is talking about in the culture of California , which I think we all agree is the greatest culture in America and maybe in the world . Thank you . There are local Californias in the culture . </s>
Think about it . Right now… A good interesting point , segue , I’ll go to your idea . There is no art education in the state in the public schools . </s>
We are the last in the state , in all of the 50 states . We are below Guam in arts education . Wow . I am serious . I mean , it’s… It’s kind of a little funny , but it’s hard to believe really… And that’s a state responsibility . </s>
The money is not there . Why is the money not there ? Because the people have lost confidence in the government obviously . I’ll give you another example . In Los Angeles , we have the biggest homeless population in America , 80,000-plus people . </s>
The L.A. County Jail is the largest mental health facility in the world…in the world . </s>
If you go there , every single one of you—I don’t care what your background or point of view on this debate would be— would be sickened to see what’s going on in there . </s>
There is a famous quote from the , uh , I think it’s Hammerati who said , “The purpose… One of the purposes of government is to protect the weak from the strong.” We have completely failed . You go in that L.A. County Jail and you will see the weakest people in our society…mentally ill people living in cages…there are 14 full-time pharmacists to medicate them…in Downtown L.A. Of the 85 or some-odd thousand people that are homeless , about a third are veterans . We have a 400-acre property in West L.A. in Westwood…that have empty buildings in it…which were built as mental institutions for veterans that are empty—and have been empty for more than 20 years . Why is that ? </s>
The state hasn’t cooperated with the feds to fix that… I don’t know…I can’t come here and give you an answer . I have been trying to fix it for the last five years , and so far I have failed . </s>
Although President Bush and Secretary Nicholson did designate three of the buildings for homeless veterans—which is a positive thing . </s>
And I understand that one of the answers on the way—there is 50 million dollars in the new defense appropriations bill for that building , which would be a great thing . But the fact that people burnt… And in my little ol’ Santa Monica , a man burnt to death in a dumpster…a homeless man , burnt to death in a dumpster several months ago…is unacceptable . And you would say , well , that , you… as a senior official of the state said to me , “Well , Bob , you know , you got ta calm down . </s>
You know , you got ta … You are very hopped up about this homeless thing.” </s>
And he said , “Why are you so hopped up about it ? ” I said , “I am afraid my mom—God bless her and God rest her soul—is going to hear that a homeless guy burnt to death in a dumpster in my jurisdiction”…which is what she used to call it , “my jurisdiction , ” not “my constituency.” Because she would be enraged . So , going on to the kinds of things that Sharon said . </s>
The public community—which is really the primary goal of the state—not to get too esoteric about it—but to have a kind of political compassion for people does not exist . You can’t have that many homeless people…you can’t have the underfunding of education that exists…you can’t have that many homeless veterans…and say that the state has been successful in creating—amongst its citizens—a concept of political compassion . That we are going to get together… We have community interests . </s>
We are going to get together and we are going to do something about them . And ideas are on the way… And green tech , great . It’s all fantastic . </s>
For the least of these , it’s not fantastic in California . It’s really not . I’ll give you another example—a local example . The City of Beverly Hills has a school system , Santa Monica has one . </s>
The state is organizing school districts like that . They had kids from out of the City of Beverly Hills in that district , because the state used to pay—and still may—a certain amount per student . So you would bring people from out of your district who were not there and educate them . They changed that formula recently , and what did Beverly Hills do ? —and they are not bad people— they expelled all those kids . </s>
Why ? We are not getting paid for it anymore . </s>
That’s a state failure—not a Beverly Hills failure , not a failure of those communities . So as you think about how you are going to vote , it’s very important to say… And I like to be optimistic—and I am optimistic . When they asked me , which side of this debate did I want to be on , I said I wanted to be on this one . And they said , well , don’t you want to be on the optimistic side ? </s>
I said , this is the optimistic side . </s>
This is the optimistic side . Because if you don’t know that the problem is as bad as it is…if you don’t go to the L.A. County Jail and see that…you think— and I mean this respectfully—that help is on the way . </s>
Help is not on the way . </s>
We , this year…I’ll give you one final example . The CalPERS—the pension charged to little , to cities—going up 25 percent . </s>
In our budget , that’s a breaker , you know ? So it has nothing to do , as I said—I am repeating myself—with Google…it has to do with , can you run the trains on time ? Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Bobby Shriver . “California is the First Failed State” is our motion . And you have all heard all of the debaters but one . And next up to argue against this motion , Lawrence O’Donnell , who has one of these Renaissance men résumés , having held positions as a political analyst for MSNBC and having served as Chief of Staff for the U.S. Senate Finance Committee , and for being a writer and producer on West Wing and for being an actor on Big Love as well . </s>
It’s a lot . Thanks for coming by . LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Do I… ? </s>
Lawrence O’Donnell . LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Thank you . </s>
Do I really have seven minutes ? Because , you know , on MSNBC , I never get out more than a sentence and a half before Pat Buchanan interrupts me , so I don’t know that I have seven minutes . I had some prepared material , which I will use some of . </s>
But I would like to very quickly go through some of the points that you have heard from the presenters of this preposterous idea . I want to though give you the correct concept that you are aiming for here , in that , in the title of this proposition , is it the first , the first failed state ? </s>
What that means is , is it the worst of 50 states ? All this side has to do—all it has to do—is give you the idea that there might be somewhere…in the 50 states somewhere…one—one—that’s doing something worse than California…or maybe doing everything worse than California . And oh , by the way , might also be a slightly less desirable place to live . That’s our chore . We have to find you one that you don’t want to live in . </s>
And you know , the proposition was defined by Andreas at the beginning . He had to admit that it was a cheeky proposition . The backing off from the strength of the declaration and the proposition . </s>
He mentioned recidivism rates in California prisons—they are not good . Crime is down , does that count ? Does it matter that in Los Angeles crime is down dramatically because the mayor had the wisdom to import the police commissioner that Rudy Giuliani , Rudy Giuliani’s ego couldn’t stand in this city , Bill Bratton ? Bill Bratton came out to L.A. in the process… and through an exercise of government—local government and local police work—got that crime rate down dramatically , as he did here . </s>
You will hear about different problems . You will hear Bobby talking about the homeless . </s>
That’s important . </s>
That is , that is tragic . </s>
But remember what the case is here . </s>
The case is , is it somehow a California issue ? Is what Bobby talked about a California issue ? California has more homeless people than any other state . It has more wealth than any other state . </s>
It has more poverty than any other state . It has more agricultural production than any other state . It has more people . It has more . Every single thing they will tell you about anecdotally—yes , California has the most of it . </s>
But as we sit here in the lower end of Manhattan , is it conceivable…is it conceivable that a homeless person has died in gruesome circumstances , in gruesome circumstances in this zip code , ever ? </s>
Or maybe , how often ? Is that the question for this zip code ? You know , Sharon mentions getting around is difficult . The traffic is hard . It is hard . </s>
It’s hard to get your car to a Dodgers game from Santa Monica , where Sharon and I live , that is true . What time do you have to leave to get a 7:00 P.M. flight from JFK ? From here . Not from up in the Upper West Side , where it’s even more difficult . </s>
But what time… ? When would you leave ? 3:00 ? </s>
I mean , you know , factor in some security issues at the airport… I don’t take 7:00 P.M. flights from JFK , because I can’t get there . It’s just not going to work—I am going to have to surrender too much of the day . The budget cuts in the university system , budget cuts— educational budget cuts have been mentioned . </s>
Take your time . </s>
Take all the time you need to come up with the name of a better public university—not in the 50 states , in the world—a better public university than the University of California at Berkeley . Take your time . We have all night . </s>
The delicious irony…the delicious irony of having this debate…in this state… Today’s local paper , The New York Times , in its seemingly endless editorial series called “The Failed State.” It stars—as usual—Albany . They have… This one happens to be about the ethics bill that they are… the improvement in the ethics program that they are trying to introduce in Albany . </s>
Utterly hopeless . You would think there would be some momentum for that—after Joe Bruno gets convicted , of actually running businesses out of his office and all other sorts of illegalities— there would be some momentum for it . It’s hopeless , it won’t happen . </s>
You don’t know what the outside income is of your state legislators—and you don’t know it by law . So when you want to have this debate about failed states and failed state governments—with the state legislature that you have—having it here is cheeky . </s>
I lived here longer than I have lived in Los Angeles . I worked in government with Senator Moynihan . Very much concerned with issues facing this state . </s>
Very much concerned with its fair share , for example . The problem… And what we discovered…and what we harped on endlessly back in the ‘80s and ‘90s was New York sends more money to the federal government than it gets back— hence , all of its budget problems . Well , the problem is much worse in California . </s>
California gets 79 cents back for every dollar that it sends to the federal government . So the reason you don’t have 40 other so-called failed states is because California tax money is paying for Alabama , it’s paying to keep Alaska running , it’s paying to keep Arkansas afloat . You can’t balance any of the books in those states without the money that comes out of California pockets to fund it . There is much more to be said about this . </s>
I am running out of time to do it . </s>
I didn’t think I had six minutes… seven minutes , thank you . </s>
Thank you , Lawrence O’Donnell . And that concludes Round 1 of this Intelligence Squared debate . </s>
This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S . I am John Donvan of ABC News , serving as moderator . </s>
And our motion is “California is the First Failed State.” We asked you in the audience—who will be serving as our ultimate judges—before the debate began…to tell us where you stood on this issue . We had you all vote . I now have the first results of that vote , and we do have a contest . </s>
Before the debate , on the motion “California is the First Failed State , ” 31 percent of you were for the motion , 25 percent against , and 44 percent are undecided . </s>
So it’s really wide open . Now moving on to Round 2 . And in Round 2 , the debaters address each other directly , and they also take questions from myself and from you in the audience . When I come to you in the audience—which will be in a few minutes— if you raise your hand , I will find you . And we would like you to rise . If you are a member of the news media , we would appreciate it if you would identify yourself as such . </s>
And when you take the microphone , hold it about a fist’s amount away from where you are speaking , so that the NPR stations can hear you clearly , as well as Bloomberg . And I really want to urge you to keep the questions to 30 seconds , and really to make them questions . Don’t argue with the panel . </s>
Questions , with a question mark at the end of it . </s>
Round 1 , our middle round . And I begin with the question to the team that is arguing that California is the first failed state . </s>
You have been making an argument—primarily , not entirely—but primarily that the failure of the State of California is largely a political failure , the failure of the political system leading to gridlock , and as a result , lack of services . </s>
The other team is arguing about… They are listing several kinds of successes . They are listing successes in innovation , and in technology , and in the development of greening the state , and stem cells , and personal connections , political connections on the small scale . They are coming back at you with success . </s>
Andreas , clearly , of The Economist , well , what’s wrong with that argument ? Well , in particular , Governor Gray Davis was making that point . I wrote down a direct quote from you , Governor , “In California , the private sector is the envy of the world . The public sector is on the mend.” You asked me , “What’s wrong with the logic of the first part ? ” </s>
And in fact , I would like to do that , and the second part as well . And we examined the first part , and go and take a larger period of history—a few hundred years . </s>
The most elegant leather shoes come from a town nearly Bologna in northern Italy . The best violins come from another town in northern Italy . </s>
That’s been that way for hundreds of years . Would you honestly make the case… ? Would you have made the case for much of post-war history that Italy was not a failed state in the European Union because they had a great shoe industry and a great violin industry in the northern Italy ? Gray Davis , do respond . </s>
It is irrelevant . The other point—just briefly . You can not seriously say that the public sector is on the mend—at the very moment when they are dismantling entire government programs that were intended to protect the weakest . </s>
And people are literally going to die , certain old people at home , because home visits are stopping . Andreas , let’s now have Gray Davis respond to your first point . </s>
The state is not an abstraction . </s>
It is the sum total of the energy , the vibrancy , the creativity and the innovation of 37 million people . It is an exciting place to live because when we have problems , we don’t moan and groan . </s>
We don’t bemoan our fate . We say , we are going to solve it , we are going to figure it out , we are going to do something different . So for Andreas to dismiss all the energy , the excitement , the creativity that is producing the iPhone and the social networking , and alternative energy , we… My God , we have got ExxonMobil investing 600 million dollars into a San Diego project that will turn algae into oil . I mean , if that’s not the establishment saying you are doing something smart in California , I don’t know what that’s about . </s>
Now to say that’s not part of the state , to say that the state is just some civil servants and some black boxes , we don’t know anything about it . The state are human beings , getting up every day , doing their best to make the world a better place . Expecting to succeed , frequently succeeding , but realizing that risk takers though they are , failure will eventually… Well , failure will occasionally occur . Governor , did you say 60 million… ? Wait , let me just… </s>
…or 60 billion ? I just want to point out… Let me just say this… That failure will occur occasionally when you take risk . </s>
But they don’t see failure as the end of the journey—they see it as an occasional stop on the road to success . That’s what separates California from a lot of other parts of the world . And that’s why it is—and will continue to be—a successful state , despite what is happening in Sacramento . Sharon Waxman . </s>
Yeah , I had a question . ExxonMobil , you say was 60 million dollars in San Diego ? 600 million dollars… </s>
600 million dollars… …in an algae to oil project . </s>
Right , OK . So the last quarterly statement for ExxonMobil , they were… Their profits were in the multiple billions of dollars . So in terms of their investments… And that’s a small multiple for… Yeah , but algae to oil… </s>
…for a company like… And they are… And we are looking into algae and oil in New York ? Are we looking to algae and oil in Kansas ? Are we looking to algae and oil in Mississippi ? They are in Nevada and Arizona… </s>
Andreas Kluth . …and especially—if you want to talk about the green economy— look to Denmark , China , Israel… Well , wait… </s>
Yeah , and it’s not in California… Andreas , let me , in your article… Governor… ? …in your article… Actually , I limit it to the United States . </s>
Gray Davis ? LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Do we have… ? I just want to make one point… LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Do I understand… ? We just have to find one state that… Well , Lawrence… </s>
Well , one state . LAWRENCE O’DONNELL …that runs from oil to algae… Lawrence , Lawrence… LAWRENCE O’DONNELL If there is one state that’s doing less… </s>
Lawrence… LAWRENCE O’DONNELL …on oil to algae , we win . Lawrence , I just… I just want to make one point… I am going to refer to Governor Davis as Gray Davis throughout the debate , not out of any disrespect for the office , but because in the debates we keep everything on a first name basis , and I want to make sure that is clear . No disrespect is intended , and I hope nobody takes it that way . And Lawrence , I was talking all over you . And it looked great , so go at it again . </s>
LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Well , you know , you are going to hear a lot about budget cutting and they are going to… You know , they are going to have to cut back on home healthcare visits and things like that . There are 43 states—43 states—that have cut their enacted budgets of 2009 . They enacted budgets for 2009 , they have—43 of them went back and cut them , OK ? Tomorrow’s newspaper will reveal to you that the governor’s latest idea—your governor’s , New York governor’s , latest idea—is the largest cut in school aid in more than two decades . That’s the latest idea for how to get things going correctly in Albany . And now in searching for new areas of revenue so they don’t have to cut quite so much money , the brilliant idea that your governor here in New York is proposing is—to legalize Ultimate Fighting . </s>
Congratulations . </s>
Bobby Shriver ? I just… And since Lawrence is so funny and so experienced , I just have to do a few little , catch-ups here . They don’t win if there is another failed state . That’s not true . It , it’s whether this is the first failed state . </s>
So he would have to say that New—and which he was actually saying… That New York was first . …right here in New York—that New York is the first failed state . Maybe that would give him a little bit of a point . But I… </s>
Lawrence , I think he has got you on that one… I really don’t think that that’s what it is . Let me do a couple of things . Berkeley is a great university . Do you know what it costs to go to Berkeley a year ? </s>
Who knows ? 30-plus thousand dollars a year . Oh my . Is that a public university ? </s>
It’s owned by the public , but when you say “Find a better one than Berkeley…” That’s not a public university . </s>
The original act that created Berkeley… …you went to Berkeley free . Free is public . Free is the community . </s>
30,000 dollars of after-tax money—per year—is not free . That’s not… Bobby , that… Bobby , that’s… Just , just… Can I make one other… ? Well , that isn’t right… </s>
Well , let’s let Gray Davis comment . OK… </s>
The under… The fees have gone up . As governor , I opposed every fee . But the fee to be an undergraduate in Berkeley this year is 10,000 dollars . OK . </s>
Well then , I am wrong . </s>
I read that it was… Undergraduate . </s>
… in the L.A. Times… </s>
The graduate schools… …then it was lies… </s>
The graduate schools of Law and Business—for several years— have been allowed to float up . </s>
And they are—as Sharon suggested—25 , 30 thousand dollars . But Ph.D. candidates are very low . </s>
So it’s still a… it’s higher than it should be , but it’s still terrific compared to other alternatives available to students… But when you have a student revolt for this… Let me just stop for a second . </s>
You do have a student revolt , but I just… That’s true . </s>
…and I got the number from the L.A. Times , so… And this is after the new editions , so maybe that’s wrong… Even to me , at 10 grand , it’s… For a people who have modest incomes… I agree . </s>
And I totally agree with you… …10 grand of after-tax money… …that it’s not fair to them . …is a real thing . </s>
The second thing is : I think if you support— which I do too—a constitutional convention , your… When did people have constitutional conventions ? The National Constitutional Convention was…when there was a big ol’ mess at hand . You don’t have a constitutional convention when things are going great . </s>
So if you support… Right ? </s>
Right ? So if you support… All right , stop . Well , let me… And let me… </s>
And let me , and let me , and let me just say . If you support a constitutional convention—and I think you should ask all three of these gentlemen whether they support it or not— . Uh-huh . —they have to lose , because now you… You don’t have… Van Jones . </s>
…a constitutional convention… I would love to bring in Van Jones… …in a successful—or a less than failed state— . </s>
Van Jones is part of the weekend summit… LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Well , the rules change by the minute here… Yeah . Exactly . </s>
Well… First of all… Oh yeah . </s>
…you are conceding the point—which is that we have , in California , the tools to continue to solve these problems . One of the things that is so exciting about the State of California is that people who have ideas get a chance to actually act on them— maybe to excess at this point . And I would have no problem with rolling back some of the detritus as it accumulates on our constitution . But we actually have the problem solvers , and the tools to solve the problems . And when you say you have a failed state—which you are , and which you are suggesting . </s>
First of all , you are trying to take off the table the economic successes . The economic successes are a function—especially in the clean tech area—of policy successes , of political successes . We have been able to put aside partisan differences on one question , which is : If we are going to have the jobs of tomorrow in California , we have got to have the technology of tomorrow…make the products of tomorrow…and we have been able to get that done . </s>
And that sets the table for the forward motion that you are talking about . So when you try and take off the table… It’s striking to me . I have never heard of a failed state where the eighth largest economy in the world… I have never heard of a failed state that is literally one-eighth of the output for the entire country . California is to the rest of the country what Germany is to the EU . And I don’t hear anybody calling Germany a failed state , whatever problems they may be , that may be there . </s>
And so I think again , you are conceding—when you talk about the fact that we are talking about a constitutional convention , and we are talking about a whole raft—that California forward and other folks are talking about a whole raft of fixes—we have got the tools and the innovation and the determination to fix the problems in California . So you are saying… …and so we are not a failed state . So you are saying then that the existence of an ambulance team , means that the hospital is basically not shut down quite yet ? Well , well… If you want to go with that… If you want to go with that analogy… I am saying that the patient is not dead . </s>
OK . And that’s what these guys are trying to do… But that’s… I think that’s a valid… actually quite cogent argument . Andreas , can you take that on ? </s>
Sure . So if you say , if you want to change it to California is dead… And I can tell you we are not debating that , and we are not arguing it… </s>
Yeah . </s>
What we are… By the way , I agree that failure—as you said—is an occasional stop . </s>
I happen to be writing a book at the moment about how failure and success are imposters . </s>
But you have to be honest that a failure has occurred , in order to fix it . </s>
Californians are honest about it—that’s why they will pass the two initiatives that will call for a constitutional convention—just as Americans , after the Revolutionary War , called a constitutional convention because the Articles of Confederation were a failure , and they accepted that and admitted that first , and then you start fresh . So you need to admit honestly that a failure has occurred…then you move on , move on . A few… Just a little bit of mopping up . About the public universities . </s>
What is the still remaining excellence of the university system a sign of ? It’s a sign of the Pat Brown legacy , when California was not a failed state . What are they dismantling ? I wrote a story about this . I asked professors and the president of the UC system . </s>
A professor at UC Santa Cruz of astrophysics told me…the excellence is being lost in her department as we speak because of the budget cuts . The people she was hiring to be good professors have defected because they know there is nowhere for them to go in their careers . They are going to more competitive , private or other public universities in the state and world . </s>
So don’t get confused about this public university . It was a sign of something working well 30 years ago… And you are… You will see—when it’s gone—that something failed today . </s>
LAWRENCE O’DONNELL And we will patiently await your naming of the state that spends more on its university system . On a per-capita basis ? LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Spends more on its university system . No , that’s… Exactly . He kinda misses… He kinda missed that… </s>
I want to go to the audience for questions now . And again , raise your hand , I’ll find you . A microphone to your mouth . </s>
There is a woman I think in the gray sweater , right ? Yes , that’s right . </s>
And ma’am , it’s easier for us—and so for the camera to see you—if you stand up… OK . And hold that mic close and make a good question… Well , sure . </s>
I am sorry ? </s>
No one here has raised , the issue of what was passed in 1979—and that was a proposition where basically , negated the state from raising any tax revenues to feed everything that you are talking about , whether it’s schools , public universities , services , art , what have you . And I would ask Van Jones , let’s start with you . Great that we have clean tech and we have the private industry and we have capitalism and competition . But if you don’t have the public monies to support initiatives , where do you get it ? Do you tax the capitalists ? </s>
Question mark , very good . </s>
Van Jones ? </s>
Well… The problem in California isn’t primarily a revenue problem . I mean , there are… We had a courageous governor , frankly , who was willing to do what needed to be done with regard to the so-called car tax . And the five billion dollars was on the table , and that’s off the table . </s>
And we are the only state , in California… The only oil producing state in the country that doesn’t tax the oil when it comes out of the ground . It is a billion dollars a year… There are revenue sources that are available . The problem in California right now is—which is why we are here—is that we haven’t agreed on the vision for California going forward . Hmmm . Now , a crisis of vision is an opportunity . </s>
And that is… Well , and that’s really , I think , what you are seeing in California . People now—and a critical mass of people—are trying to figure out how we go forward… I think obviously Prop 13 , from my point of view , it has been disastrous for the State of California . I think it’s not all taxes , but it is property taxes . And what it’s done is , it has put the state on this yo-yo of tax income based on income tax and other sources of revenue… We would have done better , I think , if we had a little bit more opportunity to have a property tax regime in place . And also the other problem with Proposition 13—which was raised—is that it would…it requires two-thirds of the legislature to agree to any tax increase . </s>
And in California , that’s a very , very difficult thing to do given where the Republican Party is . But what I would say is simply this : We have an abundance of opportunity in the State of California , because of the success of not just our clean energy—we brag on our clean tech because we are so proud of it—but we have nine different regional economies . Which gives us the ability to do what countries do , frankly . We have an agricultural region…we have , manufacturing , etc . </s>
And I think that where we are—at this stage in the development of California’s economy—is we will fix the tax structure , we will fix the budgeting structure . And we have already got redistricting done . </s>
And then , anybody who bets against California right now , is going to lose an awful lot of money . Another question ? </s>
And would you like to respond , to respond on this side before I go to a question ? I would like , I would like to start… Oh , this is Sharon Waxman . Oh yeah . I would like to not respond…I would like to ask… And clean tech is… And we keep hearing clean tech , clean tech… How about the industry that I brought up—Hollywood—where that is , that is just the subject of the most egregious neglect in the years that I have been covering the industry . </s>
This is a huge amount of money that the state has just allowed to leave . And only this past year has there been the tiniest , too little too late measure to keep it together…by passing a small fraction of the kinds of measures that other states have already had in place for years to incentivize productions to stay in the state . </s>
That’s money… That’s not money that’s out there to be created , as clean tech is a future and building , an economy of where we are going…it’s an industry that’s there , that the state has allowed to slip through its fingers , and has never actually created a sense of—as I keep using that word—connection between the people… Yeah , how… ? </s>
I mean , California invented the motion picture industry . It created… It invented the entertainment industry . How is it possible that it has been allowed to slip away ? </s>
LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Well , that’s a very simple question . And what Sharon is talking about… Lawrence O’Donnell . LAWRENCE O’DONNELL …is what in California is referred to as runaway production . A show like The West Wing , for example , was shot on a sound stage at Warner Brothers , and we would go to Washington a couple of times a year and pick up some exteriors . </s>
Dick Wolf , who shoots Law and Order—the most successful show on television in terms of longevity and ratings—wanted higher production values than that , he wanted his cameras to be able to go on the streets of New York every day . And where would you suggest shooting The Sopranos . Do you think maybe we should do that on a back lot at Universal , you think we can just get the palm trees out of the way and give you the right feel , by moving The Sopranos out there ? What’s happened is the artists involved in this giant industry which is thriving , which has had its biggest box-office year of all time this year , in a recession , the artists are looking for higher production values and opportunities to shoot in places that were never available before . </s>
You couldn’t shoot in Prague… 25 years ago if you wanted to . Lawrence— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL You can now— —do—so , you’re basically saying that the migration of the industry has nothing to do with the management of the state . That’s— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL It has absolutely nothing to do with the management of the state— </s>
That’s absolutely false— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL —nothing— —and you know it . The taxes— That’s completely empirically false . </s>
Canada , London , 20 percent tax credits , it’s not the artists who make the decisions as you know , Dick Wolf is an exception , he’s not the artist in that case , he’s the executive producer . But it’s the producers and it’s the people who sign the checks who decide where these jobs go . I’m declaring—I’m declaring impasse on the Hollywood question— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL What you’re advocating is a tax hike— </s>
I’d like to go to another question— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL —for movie producers in California— To , um… I haven’t come to this side , this gentleman in a blue shirt , sir , you— You have to stand up , thanks . </s>
Thank you . </s>
First of all , I , I think that the dwelling on the word “first” in the “first failed state” is honestly frivolous . I’d like to pose though to Governor Davis , I was a San Francisco for 15 years and , and I arrived…feeling very , very excited about the idea of direct democracy . </s>
And it seems like we’re avoiding that topic because in—to my mind , it is the very prevalence of direct democracy that is ruining California and ruining California’s political system . And— </s>
Can you formulate this as a question . How do we fix the direct democracy problem in California— Okay— </s>
—as somebody who was an elected official— I think everybody’s nodding on this one , I’d like to go to Andreas and Andreas , in , in 14 seconds— Well , wait a minute— </s>
—remind—remind— — question was put to me . Was it— ? </s>
I feel like— Was it— —Reagan saying Mr. Green , this is my microphone . I’m sorry . I’m answering— </s>
I—I apologize , Gray Davis , I had a moderator lapse— And I—I can speak— </s>
I just want to ask you— </s>
—with authority on direct democracy because I am a victim of it as well as a— Can you—Governor , can you…can you take 10 seconds for the people who missed civics class that day… 10 seconds— I can’t answer in— </s>
—to remind us of what direct democracy involved— </s>
Direct democracy in California basically means that , all issues get to the voters sooner or later , and if they don’t get to them sooner the voters put an initiative on the ballot and take matters into their own hands . And basically , everything of consequence gets decided by the voters . And I think they make basically good decisions , I won an awful lot of elections , I lost my last election . </s>
But that doesn’t mean , people didn’t have a reason to want to change . What it does mean , however , is they have the power , and I would suggest , in our system of special interests , the only people who have the power to improve things in Sacramento . </s>
They’ve already improved them , by changing the way legislators draw—legislators will never— no longer draw the districts , that means they will lose if they’re unresponsive going forward . They can improve them further , with the passage of the open primary , which I assure you , the Republican party will oppose , the Democratic party will oppose , which oughta tell you how you should vote . And on all major issues like the constitutional convention , the vote in November will just be to go out and come back to us with recommendations . </s>
We don’t like the recommendations we will vote them down . But we know the legislature , Republicans won’t allow taxes to increase , Democrats won’t allow cuts in major programs—they are immobilized , they can’t solve the problem , the only people who can solve the problem are the voters , who will I predict with the open primary , have already with reapportionment , and will I believe , give voters the opportunity to come back to us with recommendations , hopefully to get away—get away with things like the two-thirds requirement to pass the budget . But if they don’t come back with good ideas , then the voters will knock it down , so— </s>
Andreas— —direct democracy can be a problem , but it also can be a saving grace . </s>
Andreas Kluth . First of all I have to say I agree exactly with you , you’ve—because you lived there and because you came from outside as I did you saw that direct democracy is a large part of the problem . Part of it is confusion over the word democracy , James Madison didn’t want it even used in the constitution of the country , because he was afraid—they had studied ancient Athens which was a failure because of direct democracy . They had studied Republican Rome , which was very stable , they wanted Rome , not Athens . Fast forward to a century ago , the Progressive era . </s>
Californians and other western states introduced direct democracy because they were afraid of corruption by the Southern Pacific Railroad of the young state California , they wanted direct democracies , voter directly passing legislation , as a safeguard , as a fourth branch of government to be used sparingly as in Switzerland which was their model . Fast forward again to Prop 13 , and onward , and you have a circus , earlier I said , an asylum that is run by the inmates . Never mind the attack ads , the demagoguery… Here is the word count of the longest initiative , 15,633 words . That’s—it is , there was a , I remember driving in the car when several propositions were decided last year . </s>
An English teacher called in and said she’s not able to understand the initiatives in the ballot on grounds of syntax . That’s number one , people vote for double negatives when they think they’re voting for the triple negative . </s>
There is , it is in California…this is not a statement against representative democracy as the founding fathers of the nation said . I’m—this is a statement against direct democracy as practiced in California , where the legislature is hobbled , because it can not amend initiatives , and it is unique in that respect . In California it is the least informed way of making decisions . </s>
Other people have said tonight , it is curious how often the tough-on-crime voters vote for longer prison terms but forget the taxes to pay for larger prisons . Vote for faster trains , for smaller school classes , for all these things and somehow forget , not only to vote for the taxes , but then also vote for Prop . </s>
13 so that they can’t even be raised . LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Taxes can be raised in California— Lawrence O’Donnell— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL —property taxes are the only taxes affected by Proposition 13 and what it tells you is how much they can be raised . </s>
When Proposition 13 came along and said you know what , you’re sitting here , you’re living in your house , you might be on a fixed income , your house may have gone up in value dramatically over the years while you’re sitting in—living on that fixed income . And now we can not just come in and raise your property taxes 25 percent next year , they put a limit in how much you could raise them . </s>
Proposition 13 allows them to be raised , and the income tax , is sitting there , ready to be legislated at any time and the income tax is the fair way to fund government because it is based on your ability to pay . Property taxes are not based on your ability to pay , and California does make a mistake in not raising its income taxes and making them more progressive , raising top- end income taxes significantly , because , those income taxes are deductible on federal income tax returns which means at the top rate , 50 percent of that money is actually being pulled out of what the federal government would’ve taken for taxation . And you can , through a higher top-end income tax in California rebalance this relationship to the federal government’s take on California’s wealth . </s>
Taxes can be raised— Okay— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL —they’ve never passed a bill saying taxes— </s>
Bobby— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL — can not be raised— —Bobby Shriver to respond . I just want to make one small quibble , actually it’s a large quibble with Gray which is—he used the phrase , “Voters put these initiatives on the ballot.” The real harsh truth I’m afraid is that voters do not put the initiatives on the ballot . There’s an—in fact a huge industry , which are in effect sort of semi-private legislatures… You really have to think about that . </s>
There are people who are very well-financed , may not even live in California , who can hire teams of people , which is a business , a big business , to write legislation for the state . They’ve had every conceivable , you all probably know , ridiculous things that have been put on and defeated . And some ridiculous things have been passed because people as Andreas was saying , can’t figure out the syntax , I’m a lawyer , and I can’t figure out some of them , the book that comes to you when you vote is that big , and you’re expected to read in very fine print those documents . </s>
And the correlative to this idea is the deprofessionalization honestly of the legislature itself which is to some extent the function of the term limits law which is going to be extended— </s>
Passed by initiative . Indeed . But the point there is that you have these permanent , semi-private , or entirely private groups of people , whose business it is every year , to make law for the state , who— So are you making the argument— </s>
No , and I want to say a second thing now that I hear Van’s dulcet tones . We’re— Switching gears a little bit to the— </s>
I’m just shocked to hear a California— —it—I just want to say that , what is the state , and I thank you for saying that the “first” point is a frivolous point which I entirely agree with . </s>
What is a state if it’s not the creator of the vision of the state . When Van says we’re having a crisis , I—to me , I was ready to get up and walk because we win . No , no , no . </s>
If there’s a crisis , that requires— —a constitutional— —resolve the crisis— —a vision we have not yet agreed what the state of California is , that’s a—that’s the ultimate political failure . </s>
Because—and that’s why a constitutional convention probably will pass and that’s why— I mean , here’s the thing , that I always loved , was in the Declaration of Independence , not a constitutional convention but an important document nonetheless . Everybody knows the first sentence . </s>
Right ? “All men are created equal , ” very few people remember the last sentence , which is , “To these truths we mutually pledge our lives , our fortunes and our sacred honor”— And our sacred honor . That’s the last sentence . </s>
And I defy you , today , to get— And the people who signed it , George Washington , richest guy in the country . Thomas Jefferson— Let’s , let’s bring in Van— No—I’m just saying , I want to finish— Can you get the citizens of California to sign a pledge— Bobby , let’s hear from the—let’s bring in the other side— </s>
—today , to lives and fortunes , Lawrence maybe would sign it— Gray Davis— My good friend Bobby who I appointed to the Parks Commission before his relative , kicked him off the Parks Commission— </s>
And my relative fired me . </s>
Bobby , I want you to know that— Thankfully he also fired Clint Eastwood on the same day— —the entire— The entire… It’s true . …group in favor of this proposition— </s>
And Governor Davis did in fact appoint me , thank you— </s>
The entire group on my right in favor of this proposition all lives in Bobby Shriver’s district , so… Little cabal over there… I want to make two points . The constitutional convention is proposed by the Bay Area Business Council . Yes . Apple . </s>
Google . Hewlett-Packard . Facebook . Because they think , Sacramento is not acting properly . </s>
And to get the constitutional convention on the ballot , they have to get the signature of several hundred thousand Californians . </s>
So people do put initiatives on the ballot . Now is it a perfect system , no , and do we have a lot of shysters out there , misrepresenting what’s on the ballot , absolutely . My , one of my…a sister of a dear friend of mine signed the recall petition against me . And I said how could that be and she said because— </s>
She voting here tonight ? -- signature gatherer said oh , this is good for teenagers , this is good for teenagers . </s>
So , you know , there are flaws in the system . But people do put the initiatives on the ballot , people will solve the problem through the open primary and the constitutional convention , and I have great faith that Van will wisely use the remainder of our time . </s>
Well , I just wanted to point out this is classic California . Here you have the people who are saying , the ballot initiative is terrible , it’s awful , we’ve got ta get rid of it . So we’re going to use the ballot initiative to get the constitutional convention that we want . That’s exactly the beauty of the system that we have . Is that we , in California we have big problems but we also have big tools to solve those problems . </s>
And , I would , I’m shocked to hear— Are you , are you really defending the— </s>
Yes— —the legislative system— I—first of all , first of all— </s>
—the—and the initiative system , really— I’m shocked to hear a California politician arguing publicly that the people of California should give up their ability to participate in California’s governance which is basically what you’re saying . We— </s>
Not exactly but go ahead— — so— </s>
Sophistry . Not exactly but go ahead— I would be happy and I think most of us here would be happy to see some curtailment of some of the abuses of the initiative process but I think , in California we should be proud . You say that people are ill-informed , et cetera , well that’s true about , you know , people going into the malls and making purchases . There’s no such thing as perfect information , but in California , every time we have one of these moments , people know their voice will matter , they will get a chance to vote directly on some of these issues , and we could not solve the problems that you’re describing , without the best thinking of all the people in California— </s>
Let me go to another— not an impasse— —let me get— —can I just , I have to say one little thing . </s>
It’s got ta be really , really little— </s>
I—it’s really— I didn’t say the people were ill-informed . I said I…am ill-informed . I can’t read . </s>
I went to Yale Law School with you . I can’t read… The thing that comes in my post office box , I’m ill-informed . So— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL I want to stipulate that this side of the panel agrees with Bobby’s last statement . We rehearsed that , we rehearsed that . I want to go to another que—also I want to point out that Lawrence O’Donnell’s tactic of playing with the word “first” has been tried here before , we had a debate on whether George W. Bush was the worst President of the last 50 years , here in New York City . </s>
Karl Rove spent the whole night talking about Jimmy Carter . And he won the debate . So whether it works tonight is up to you , one more question , just down , this gentleman , yeah , with the laser . </s>
I’d just like to ask both of you whether you think California will go bankrupt . </s>
And if it does go bankrupt does that mean it’s a failed state . Great question . </s>
I’ll answer that— </s>
Gray Davis . </s>
I can say with no fear of contradiction that it won’t , because , it can’t . It can’t legally go bankrupt but more importantly… It’s technically true . More importantly— it’ll work its way out of these problems and if you’re thinking of buying a California bond , I can assure you that the legislators understand the importance of lending to get them through these tough times . Bonds come not after schools , the first dollar goes to schools , that comes in the door , the second dollar goes to pay GO bonds , the third dollar’s the school , the fourth dollar— So as long as we have about 60 cents on the dollar in Sacramento we probably have about 85 to 95 percent extension now . </s>
Your bonds are in good hands . </s>
Buy California bonds . </s>
Andreas Kluth . Vote no in the proposition . He just made a— I hope he’s covered for his investment advice . </s>
Andreas— You just heard a great answer if you were wondering whether you should buy municipal bonds in California then you might . Remember—because , it’s true , technically , legally a state can not go bankrupt . </s>
The order of payments is indeed correct . Remember that California has the worst credit rating of the 50 states…that is a superlative . It has just been lowered to one notch above junk , by the time this debate is over it probably is junk , so— Even in the order of payments that you’ve just heard which was correct , it may indeed go , you know , the bonds may indeed default , which we don’t even need to prove , to carry our motion . Well , Dana—I just—I want to—Dana , do we have time for one more ? Okay , I’d like to get to one more question with your indulgence be—just to hear from the people . </s>
Anybody high , I…arbitrary left side , right side , right here , sure . Thank you . </s>
I’d like to get the panel to focus on the task at hand and I think the task at hand is ours . </s>
We are being asked to cast a one-word answer , a vote , to a six-word question . And the six-word question is , “California is the First Failed State” and I’d like to focus the panel on the word “is.” </s>
Are we being asked to decide whether California at eight p.m. on January 19th , 2010 , is failed , now , or are we being asked to cast a vote on whether you think , the proposition is that California is now and will be irredeemably or for some time to come , a failure— Sir , can I just ask you to do something because this’ll be broadcast in different times and different places and rather than say , at eight p.m. , would you mind just restating , the—in a very short way— And I might suggest you could say right now at this moment as we stand here , or something along that— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL You’re in show business now . </s>
You’re in show business . Let me do another take— show business . </s>
Everybody’s a director . </s>
Right now as we stand here . Do—should I just say that , or do you want to repeat the whole thing— </s>
You know what ? I give up , let’s go to the question . Which side would like to take this first , Lawrence O’Donnell— LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Well , I just want to check up here where it was determined that concentrating on the word “first” is frivolous . What’d you make of that one . </s>
It depends on what the meaning of “is” is . No , I think , I— Not at all , I— Sharon Waxman— We’re clearly saying , from a position of people who live in California , who believe in California , who’ve spent—who have decided to spend our lives there , that California is currently a failed state , it makes me very sad to hear the other side of the panel…giving , paying truly lip service to the notion that yeah , it has some problems . Talk—that’s about the understatement of this century , this early part of the century or the new decade . </s>
If you live in California and you read the news every day , it is a litany of failures , rogue laws , gridlocks , budget… Pick your billion , 20 billion this week , 30 billion last— three—six months ago , whatever the hole is that has to be filled , the latest service to be cut , the latest milk and cookies that will not be served . It is— this is the lives of the people of the state of California , it’s not a joke . It’s not , how bad is New York or how bad is Arkansas . It is—this is where we are spending our lives , and for us to be arguing this , it is because we believe that California does hold the promise of being the greatest state in the nation , not because we believe it is irredeemably failed and can not be saved . But to hear people who are in our government , on the other side of , of the panel , suggesting that it’s all cheer , cheery and roses , is very disheartening I have to say for me as a resident of the state , the state is stuck . </s>
And it is not working , and if you live there , and if you pay attention at all , you have to know that . I’d like to respond to that— Gray Davis . I have a lot of respect for Sharon . You do ? </s>
But I want to— But I’m— I’m so touched— —I’m married to one out there , with me , Sharon Davis , but , Sharon Waxman , but…you are the reason— I have a lot of respect for Sharon Davis . </s>
And a lotta love for Sharon Davis . LAWRENCE O’DONNELL As do we all . But you’ll still vote for our side— But here’s the point . I think you can see it in your first sentence . </s>
We live in California . We believe in California . </s>
We know it will solve its problems and get better . From 1998 to 2008 , according to The Wall Street Journal two days ago , California’s economic growth was 25 percent , the rest—the national average was 16 percent , that’s real after inflation adjustments . Everywhere you look , people are doing their best to make this world a better place in California , and they’re doing it in other states as well . </s>
We are doing the best we can , in a very difficult time . I’m sure Sharon has noticed that there’s a national recession . We have 10 percent unemployment , there are problems all over America . We are bigger than other states and the problems sometimes are bigger in California . </s>
But they’re not too big for us to solve , and along the way , we are contributing enormous productivity and innovation to America . And I suggest to you , as we get more global , we’re going to rely more and more on states that can innovate . Because you can’t out-source an idea , until someone invents it . And that concludes Round 2 of our debate . </s>
And here’s where we are , we are now about to go into Round 3 where we will hear brief statements , closing statements from each of the debaters in turn . </s>
They’ll be two minutes each . And this is their last chance to change your minds before you vote again . </s>
From the live audience vote beforehand , we know where you stood before the debate began , here again are the results , the results before the debate on the motion , “California is the First Failed State , ” 31 percent of you agreed with the motion , you were for it , 25 percent were against it , and 44 percent were undecided , you’ll be asked to vote again in a short , few minutes from now , but , on to Round 3 , closing statements from each of the debaters in turn and speaking first , against the motion , Lawrence O’Donnell , senior political analyst for MSNBC and former Democratic Chief of Staff of the US Senate Committee on Finance . LAWRENCE O’DONNELL First failed state— Oh , Lawrence , you can—the—we sit on all of these . </s>
LAWRENCE O’DONNELL Okay , sorry— </s>
Sure , no problem . </s>
LAWRENCE O’DONNELL I thought…I’m sorry , I’m from the state where words matter . Same with you . So some people have doubts about what does “is” mean , that’s a familiar question . </s>
Some people have doubts that “first” should be in here which is to say , it’s allowable then if we drop “first” that there are other states doing things much worse than the California government is doing things . In the fiscal years that cover this current recession , 2009 through the 2010 fiscal years , states have faced $ 256 billion in budget gaps…nationwide , $ 256 billion . They’ve solved $ 73.1 billion of those budget gaps so far . They have a lot of work to do to close those gaps , this is one of those states , where we sit right now . </s>
Now , California , in its riches , just like New York in its riches , has been generous . It has a Medicaid formula that is more generous than other states . If you’re on Medicaid in California you get more benefits at a higher level of income , the high—the income cutoff is a higher level than in these other states . And so if you want to say to Alabama , go ahead , Alabama , keep it up… Keep it up , don’t let people have Medicaid—or if they make as much as $ 15,000 a year for a family of four , don’t let them have it . If you want to vote that way , and say , I’m going to penalize the state that has tried and in its trying , has to struggle then in this anti-tax environment in this country of raising the money to pay for what it has promised , and then ends up in this very difficult fight every year about how do we balance this budget that doesn’t seem to be balanceable— which is exactly what happens in this state every year , exactly what happens . </s>
If you want to penalize those governments , those liberal governments over generations of liberal advance in social programs , for overfunding health care for the poor if you want to call it that , because now it has to be cut back , or overfunding public education because now it has to be cut back under these burdens that they face today , then go ahead . </s>
Penalize those states . Declare here tonight , that Alabama has done a better job than California— Lawrence O’Donnell , your time is up , thank you very much . Our motion , “California is the First Failed State , ” summarizing his position in favor of this motion , The Economist’s West Coast correspondent , Andreas Kluth . I don’t want to summarize it because , I don’t think I need to , I want to say thank you to you , sir , for focusing our , our attention again on the proposition that you’re now deciding in this binary way , “California is the First Failed State , ” you wanted me to focus on “is” and “first.” </s>
California is the first failed—failed state means simply that tonight as we speak it is a failure . It does not mean that , five years from now , it can not have made a fresh start . In fact , the most important prerequisite for making a fresh start and insuring , just as it came up earlier -- in Pat Brown’s day , California was not a failure , today it is . </s>
Things can change , however , you have to take a a vital step first . </s>
You have to admit that something has failed for you to change it . This is sort of a microcosm of two organizations in California , one called California Forward , one called Repair California . </s>
The names will tell you nothing what they stand for , one wants to deny that the failure is fundamental and wants to fiddle , wants to fiddle here , fiddle there , muddle along , and hope that it’ll get better , the other is Repair California which is the organization now pushing the initiatives for the constitutional convention . They want you to say that the failure is fundamental , and therefore we need a new constitution because ours is unmanageably complex , with 500 amendments…in half the time that it took America’s constitution to have 27 amendments , all because of initiatives . The people of California will pass those initiatives calling for a constitutional convention…in any poll , opinion poll that you may now read . And that is because the people of California take it for granted , they just assume , there is a consensus that the failure is as of today , in fact there , that California has failed , and that we must start fresh with a new constitution , to prevent it , finally , “first” simply means , the other states , the other 49 have to watch out so they don’t repeat our mistakes . </s>
Thank you , Andreas Kluth . Making his summarizing statement against the motion that “California is the First Failed State , ” Van Jones , former White House Special Advisor for Green Jobs and co-founder of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights and Green for All . Well , first of all I just want to say , I do think that the question is properly stated about the present moment . </s>
I want to say that , it’s been posed that if you don’t believe that we are in …sub… collapse , that we don’t care about the people who are suffering in California , that’s not true . People are suffering in California right now . There are people who are suffering in prisons , way too many people , we’re spending way too much money , they have way too little hope and way too little help when they get out . But , I also know that we have great ideas , we have people throughout the state of California moving restorative justice ideas to fix that . </s>
Even the governor now says maybe we should make it unconstitutional to spend so much money on prisons , more than we spend on our four-year colleges and universities . When you are looking at how you evaluate any situation in your own life , you look at your problems , you look at your deficits , but you also look at your assets . </s>
And as long as you are breathing , as long as you have the ability to confront your problems , you’re not a failure . And , I’m going to say , anybody in this room going through anything , you’re not a failure , until you quit . People in California have not quit , we are moving forward , we are coming together in ways that are extraordinary , and we will solve these problems . And I ask you to vote to support us , to encourage us and say , that we’re not failures , you’re not failures , this country is not a failure , we have problems that we have to solve and we will solve them together . </s>
Thank you , Van Jones . Making her summarizing statement for our motion , “California is the First Failed State , ” Sharon Waxman , editor-in-chief of The Wrap.com , an entertainment and media business news source . Well , I believe the other side has actually made our point this evening . </s>
They’ve said that California is full of innovative people , it’s full of ideas , its culture is rich , that invention is still vibrant in the state and the lifestyle is beautiful . All of that is true and that’s why we all choose to live there . But all of that is despite the fact that the state has failed . </s>
And it’s not bec—and we stay there for all those reasons because , we continue to push forward , but not because the state lends a hand , plays its role in providing education , transportation , security , a prison system , a medical system , the things that are the state . </s>
That is what we’re here to talk about tonight , it is a very serious matter for those of us who live and who have engaged our lives in the state . And to hear Van say that we are coming together in ways that are extraordinary , it sounds really lovely , I have no idea what that means . We’re not coming together , and there’s nothing extraordinary about what’s happening to California as a state except extraordinarily bad , I’m sad to say . So I ask you all to vote for this proposition as a gesture , of not only that we have proved the case , but as a gesture of helping take the step of consciousness , and of moving California toward the right future , which is not the path that it’s on . Thank you , Sharon Waxman . </s>
The motion is , “California is the First Failed State , ” and summarizing his position against the motion , Gray Davis , the 37th governor of California , also served as Lieutenant Governor , State Controller , and State Assemblyman . I want you to vote against the proposition , because the proposition is what it purports to be , California…supposedly is the first failed state . </s>
By any measure , we are more generous than virtually any other state , I was proud to provide health care to 900,000 youngsters that didn’t have it when I became governor . Occasionally there’s talk that maybe we have to reduce that by a little bit . </s>
I don’t like it , but we’re living in tough times . As Mr. O’Donnell said , we’re more generous in our Calworks program , we have our own separate welfare program to tag onto what the federal government does . </s>
We’re more generous on our health care programs , we supplement what the federal government does . So sometimes in tough times , we’re not able to do all the things we would like to do . </s>
But we’re not sitting around moaning and groaning . We’re solving our problems , the people are taking matters into their own hands , I’m confident that they will adopt an open primary , I’m confident that they will give voters the chance to go out and make recommendations to change…what’s happening…because of the shortcomings of 121 people in Sacramento . </s>
But I just want to assure you that you’re going to be in very good company if you vote no , Time magazine would have you vote no . Wall Street Journal two days ago said , California , failed state , it’s such a big subsidizer of the other states that are in trouble in this country , it oughta secede . Now I don’t want us to secede because I don’t think we’re in great shape today . But we’re on our way to being in great shape again , and we’re going to be a very important part of America , going forward in our global economy . </s>
So I would ask you to look at the proposition and say to yourself , California’s doing a lot of things better than most other states , I’m not going to say it is the first failed state in America . Please vote no , which I think is number 2 on your list . Very good , Gray Davis , thank you . Our final speaker , summarizing for the motion that “California is the First Failed State , ” Bobby Shriver , Santa Monica city councilman , and co-founder of One.org and Red . </s>
Thank you . I also appreciated the “is” question . </s>
Because , and I appreciate also Sharon’s seriousness about this matter , I mean we’ve had a little fun , which is great . </s>
But the truth is tonight , at this moment , people are suffering in really unimaginable ways , and this is a pretty wealthy crowd , a powerful crowd , we’re here in New York , it’s all good . </s>
The people that the government and the sense of political compassion is created to serve are really , really bad in California . Calworks that Gray mentioned’s about to be defunded entirely . </s>
The reason that we have a lot of homeless in people is not because LA is big as Lawrence suggested . </s>
It’s because the policies of the state , don’t work . Mental health financing is with the county , housing is with the city . They don’t work together , they haven’t worked . There’s been no progress made , enormous progress has actually been made in New York , on homelessness . Despite what other things New York hasn’t done well . </s>
I want to reiterate , we’re the optimistic people , we’re not moaning and groaning . We’re not , oh , woe is us , California doesn’t have a lot of brilliant people , a lot of venture capital , a lot of cool companies , we acknowledge all that . </s>
We’re not talking about that , we’re talking about the state which is a revenue-collection mechanism . It disperses money to people , to do things that the community wants done . </s>
If that isn’t happening , the state , not the people , not our energy , not our optimism , not our tools , none of that , is relevant . It’s a revenue- collection thing based on principles . We are not collecting and distributing the revenue to the most vulnerable people in the state today by an immense margin . The suffering…here , is immense . And that’s why you have to vote , to give a wake-up call , to the people who hold the power in the state and the people of California , so that they can feel comfortable to say you know what , we’re optimistic , we’re going to get it done , but we got a problem . </s>
Thank you , Bobby Shriver , and that concludes Round 3 of our debate . And now it’s time to find out who our winners are , you in the audience will choose our winners , I’m going to ask you to go again to the keypad on the right arm of your seat , at each seat you will register your vote . And we will get the read-out instantaneously , practically . </s>
Vote number 1 if you are for—our motion is “California is the First Failed State , ” vote number 1 , push number 1 if you are for the motion . Push number 2 if you are against the motion , and number 3 if you remain undecided— We’d like ‘em all to stand , because they’re New Yorkers . New Yorkers , they get to vote . You know , I just want to thank this panel for the level of game they brought to this debate , they really put the intelligence in Intelligence Squared . </s>
It was really excellent . </s>
And also you in the audience , your questions were excellent tonight . But before I announce the results of the vote which I’ll have in just a minute , a few things to take care of , our next debate will be on Tuesday , February 9th , our motion is , “The US Should Step Back from its Special Relationship with Israel.” </s>
Panelists for the motion are New York Times columnist Roger Cohen and Columbia University professor Rashid Khalidi , against the motion are Ambassador Stuart Eisenstadt who served under both Presidents Carter and Clinton , and Israel’s former ambassador to the US , Itamar Rabinovich . </s>
Individual tickets are still available for that one by visiting our website and also at the Skirball box office outside . </s>
And you can follow , join , become a fan of Intelligence Squared on Facebook and by doing so receive a discount , on our upcoming debates . All of our debates as you know because we’ve talked about it tonight can be heard on NPR stations , now on more than 200 stations across the nation . </s>
I guess they’re going to have to edit around that dating thing that you did , but they can work . You can also watch the spring debates on the Bloomberg Television Network , airdates and times can be found in your program . And also don’t forget to read about tonight’s debate in next week’s edition of Newsweek , and there are copies in the library that you can pick up on your way out . So , now the results are in , they’ve just been handed to me , and remember the team that changes the most minds is the team that is declared the winner . Now our motion is , “California is the First Failed State , ” when you voted before the debate , 31 percent of you were for the motion , 25 percent against , and 44 percent undecided . </s>
After the debate , 58 percent are for the motion , 37 percent against , and 5 percent undecided . </s>
The team for the motion , wins our debate , thank you very much to all of our panelists , to you in our audience , from me , John Donvan , thank you from Intelligence Squared US . Thank you , Robert . And may I just invite another round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz , for making all of these debates possible . Welcome to the Symphony Space in New York City , I’m John Donvan , your host and moderator for this Intelligence Squared US debate , another in a series of , we hope smart and scintillating programs , debating topics that matter . The motion before us , this time , “Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.” </s>
This is a contest , it’s a contest of logic and wit , and mostly persuasion , these panelists are here to change your minds , you the audience are the judges . Now , to introduce our panelists . First , Peter Huber , author of The Bottomless Well , and a columnist for Forbes . Bjorn Lomborg , founder of The Copenhagen Consensus . Philip Stott , emeritus professor and biogeographer from the University of London . </s>
This is the team arguing for the motion . Arguing against the motion , Hunter Lovins , president of Natural Capitalism Solutions… Oliver Tickell , a journalist and author of the Kyoto II Climate Initiative… And Adam Werbach , global CEO of Sacchi and Sacchi S. The Intelligence Squared and Intelligence Squared US debate series are produced by the Rosenkranz Foundation . Shortly , you will hear from our six panelists , three for the motion and three against the motion . </s>
The motion is , “Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.” </s>
Now we want to ask you at this point to register your views on this motion as you come in off the street , before hearing any of the argument , because as I say , they are here to persuade you and to change your minds . You can reach now for those keypads , and I’ll remind you particularly if you came in late , the way to vote if you agree with the motion , that “Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money , ” push number 1 . If you disagree push number 2 , if you are undecided push number 3 . If you regret your decision , you can correct it by pushing the correct button , and it will register the last entry . </s>
Does anybody need more time ? All right , so what we’re going to do is tabulate those and a little bit later in the evening , I will share the results of that polling . </s>
The panelists will each be given seven minutes to speak . If they reach the seven-minute mark and are still going I’ll have to step in , after that , we’ll be hearing from you in the audience and following that section and that’s normally the longest section , each panelist will be given two minutes to summarize their views , and then , we will vote again , and find out who the winner is . And I want to make clear… the way that we determine a winner , is to see , who was more persuasive in changing minds , in other words if somebody starts with a 60 percent margin , and the other team obviously has 40 percent , whoever moves their percentage higher will actually be declared the , the winner of the evening . </s>
That’s clear to everybody ? Yeah , okay . So , let’s let the debate begin . Our motion is , “Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money , ” and arguing first for the motion , Bjorn Lomborg , he is from Denmark , the land that has led the globe in the development of wind power , it is an environmentalist’s dreamland . </s>
But he is an environmentalist skeptic in many ways , and is first to argue for the motion . </s>
Bjorn Lomborg . I’ll speak for the motion that “Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money.” Perhaps a natural reaction to that would be , what , are there still people who think it’s more important to save money , than to save the world ? That’s not our point . Our point is , that we should really save the world , not just feel like we’re saving it . </s>
Let’s be clear—global warming is real . Man-made , and increases by carbon emissions . </s>
And global warming will harm future generations , especially the world’s poor . </s>
But the brutal fact is , that even major carbon cuts at dramatic cost will make little impact on temperature , and do virtually nothing to help the world . Still , my honored opponents will spend hundreds or even thousands of billions of dollars , to slightly reduce the impact of climate change 100 years from now , yet more than half the world’s population suffers from Medieval problems that we could fix right now , at much lower cost . This is nothing less than a moral tragedy for the developed world . Knowingly squandering colossal sums of money , achieving almost nothing , while fractional sums could save millions of lives right now . Obvious as it may sound , our goal isn’t for those of us in wealthy western world to feel good about ourselves , presumably , it’s about making sure we do the most good . </s>
Today , 1 billion lack clean drinking water , 2 billion people lack sanitation , 3 billion people lack simple micronutrients , preventing physical and mental development . One quarter of all the world’s deaths , are due to easily curable infectious diseases . The equivalent of the population of Florida , wiped off the map , each year . As an example , 1 million people die from malaria each year , and up to 2 billion people get the debilitating disease . </s>
Yet , my esteemed opponents will focus on how global warming will cause a slight increase in malaria increase 100 years from now , and suggest that we should fix that through inefficient carbon cuts . </s>
But we could eradicate malaria right now , if we wanted , and at a lot lower cost . </s>
That is the moral choice . </s>
This pattern of little good at high cost , we find repeated in the cases by opponents will present to you . And this is why all peer-reviewed economic valises show that simply cutting carbon is a poor way to help the world . And that’s exactly the crux of tonight’s debate . </s>
That the best available economic evidence tells us that by focusing on cutting carbon emissions , we’re committing to an exceptionally inefficient way to tackle the symptoms of global warming , let alone global warming itself . And given how much of our resources will be squandered in the process , the consequences are nothing less than a moral tragedy . Of course , my esteemed opponents will claim that without major carbon cuts , the world will be beyond saving . Oliver Tickell has written that unabated global warming by the end of the century will be a catastrophe , and the beginning of the extinction of the human race because all the ice will melt and we’ll see 200 feet of sea-level rise in the long term , wiping out pretty much everyone we hold dear , killing billions of people . This doom-mongering is simply wrong . </s>
It’s inconsistent with everything we know . And it’s important that people everywhere start to realize this . We’ve entrusted the UN Climate Panel , the so-called IPCC , with its thousands of scientists , to outline the most likely climate consequences . They do not support Tickell , or any of the other , more alarmist writings of recent times . What the IPCC does tell us is , yes , sea levels will rise , somewhere between six and 24 inches over the coming century . </s>
Such a rise is entirely manageable , and not dissimilar to the about 12 inches we barely noticed , have risen over the last 150 years . Dramatic , expensive carbon cuts would make sea-level rise just a few inches less in 100 years . Is this really the best we can do to help the world ? </s>
Of course , the obvious and easy thing to say is , well , we should do all good things , we should both make major carbon reductions , and combat malaria . But this simply ignores the fact that we aren’t doing either very well . We avoid the hard truth that the rich world’s focus is shifting daily towards global warming , with proportional less support seen for the real , and more tractable problems . It’s simply untruthful to claim that the focus on climate change doesn’t mean there’s less money going elsewhere . The Global Fund to Fight AIDS , Tuberculosis and Malaria , is telling us that billions of dollars are being redirected to the fight , global warming , at the expense of the biggest killers of the poor countries . </s>
Any company or organization today that wants to be responsible , even just cool , will not be spending their cash on fighting tuberculosis , but wants to go carbon-neutral . We must save the world , yes . And here’s how . At The Copenhagen Consensus Project last year , a panel of the world’s most distinguished economists looked at a wealth of research of all the major problems in the world , and the possible solutions to them . And they showed us where we can do the most good . </s>
They agreed that global warming’s real , and they were unanimous that the best way to tackle it is by investing much more in research and development in low carbon energy technologies . The economists also found that carbon emission cuts , tonight’s motion , would be the poorest use of our money . They confirmed that we can do so much more good elsewhere , that we need to ease our preoccupation with cutting carbon , and focusing much more on fixing the real problems of the here and now . This is about saving everyone’s world . Not through ineffective and hugely costly carbon cuts , but through effective research and development , and low carbon energy sources , that anyway , will be the only long-term solution to the CO2 problem . </s>
And then remembering the major problems and challenges of this world . Every single year and right now , a devastation is taking place in our world . </s>
A dumb , readily avoidable devastation . </s>
Continuing mindlessly , and spending hundreds of billions of dollars in carbon cuts , is simply disgraceful , when it takes so little to do something about this devastation . So , this is our chance . </s>
Our chance not just to feel good about helping the planet , but actually to do the right thing , the rational thing , and the morally correct thing . I commend this motion to you , do what’s rational , not just what’s fashionable . Thank you . Thank you , Bjorn Lomborg . And worth waiting for . </s>
Our next speaker , Oliver Tickell , has had actually something of an intellectual feud with Bjorn in the pages of The Guardian , in London , back and forth , but Oliver himself is from Britain…has come up with— if Kyoto was the treaty that was supposed to slow the growth of greenhouse gases , it has failed and Oliver Tickell has come up with Kyoto II , an environmental blueprint . Environment is his passion and he is next arguing against the motion , ladies and gentlemen , Oliver Tickell . I would prefer not to see this as any kind of feud , I think it’s a debate and it’s a debate which I’m very pleased to be able to pursue here , with all of you . </s>
Bjorn did an excellent presentation , and he made very effective use of the particular rhetorical flourish which I would call the false choice , or the false dichotomy . Either we address the problem of global warming , or we address the problems of malaria , water provision , and malnutrition . But this is a false choice , no one’s saying that we’ve got to do one or other , we can do both . It is no more real a choice than that between tackling global warming and eating pizza . </s>
You know , we can do both . In fact , if we tackle the problems of global warming in an effective way , it will directly help with the provision of water . </s>
One of the major problems of global warming is the loss of rainfall , shifting patterns of rainfall , melting of glaciers that feed hundreds of millions of people worldwide . So , failing to deal with global warming is a huge step back on that fight , likewise with malaria , and other insect-borne disease , as temperatures rise , so these diseases will spread and become more prevalent , and hold back development further . </s>
Now . The core point though , Bjorn very kindly began to make it for me . It is that the consequences of not dealing with global warming are potentially catastrophic . And , he said this is inconsistent with everything we know . </s>
Well , that’s wrong . What we do know , is that 55 million years ago , at a time called the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum , temperatures were ten degrees warmer than they are now . </s>
Carbon dioxide levels were approximately one thousand parts a million -- very high levels . And sea levels were approximately two hundred and fifty feet higher . Now , we have been there before . We can go there again . There is no law that says that we can not revert to that state of fifty-five million years ago . </s>
There is no certainty that that will happen . It might happen or it might not . Climate is extremely complex . </s>
There are many , many feedbacks of frankly , breathtaking intricacy and complexity , which we haven’t even begun to fathom . And for that reason , I find Bjorn’s certainty that this will not take place completely incomprehensible . There is no certainty in this . The only certainty is once it’s already happened . And given those uncertainties , our overwhelming priority must be to make sure that it does not happen . </s>
It is hard even to put a probability on it , but the facts are that climate , the climate system is characterized by feedbacks , including some very powerful positive feedbacks , even with the one degree . In fact , under one degree of temperature rise that we’ve had so far , these feedbacks are kicking into effect . These include the melting of arctic sea ice which causes the sun’s rays to be absorbed , raising temperatures at the poles . It includes the reduced absorption of carbon dioxide into oceans . There were results in the newspaper yesterday from the Sea of Japan where the absorption of carbon dioxide is halved . </s>
We see that the forests of Canada , which had been considered a major net carbon sink , are now becoming a net source of carbon as a result of insect depredations caused by higher temperatures . So , positive feedback process are already taking place as temperatures continue to rise further . Further positive feedbacks can swing into effect and we could indeed find ourselves propelled through the uncontrolled emissions of methane , from example , from peat bogs and swamps . We could find that we well and truly lose control of climate , that positive feedbacks take over from everything that we are doing ourselves . </s>
And that is where we must not go . And yes , there are costs . To avoid this you have to spend money . But there are many other cases in which we spend money to avoid potentially catastrophic risks , even if we perceive those risks as being improbable – such as insurance against a car crash or a house fire , where the costs are potentially huge , even if the probability is low . </s>
In this particular case , of course , we have to be mindful of the cost . We don’t just want to throw unlimited amounts of money at this problem . But if we look at the amounts of money , I mean , my cost – and which includes not only mitigation but also substantial funding for adaptation , which is already taking place – is about one trillion dollars per year . And that is , roughly the same as what the world spends on weaponry and the military sector . </s>
So if we can afford to spend that on weapons , why can’t we afford to spend it to prevent this potentially ruinous catastrophe that could come upon us . But I will go a stage further . I will say that much of this isn’t really cost at all . It is investment . Because we need ultimately to move away from fossil fuels anyway . </s>
If we move away from fossil fuels sooner , before we have to – because they run out – that actually saves enormous economic cost . It saves the economic cost of a hundred and fifty dollar a barrel petrol , oil . And that is something that has caused America and other countries huge hardships . We can create new industries . </s>
We have huge idle work forces . We have huge idle productive capacity in industries that can be put back to work building us a future free of fossil fuels . </s>
The world at the moment is ravaged by conflict , much of that conflict over access to fossil fuels . </s>
If we move to a fossil fuel-free future , then much of that expenditure will vanish . But not only that expenditure , but all of the suffering , all of the tragedy that is associated with it . So in answer to the question , the motion , Is it worth the money to make these major reductions in carbon dioxide emissions ? , the only possible answer is , Yes , and do it now . </s>
Thank you , Oliver Tickell . Our motion is : Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money . And now arguing for the motion , Peter Huber , an author who publishes here in the United States , books with titles like The Bottomless Well . But I like to look at the subtitles that tell us really what he thinks . One of his books was subtitled : Saving the Environment From the Environmentalists ; another , Why We Will Never Run Out of Energy . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Peter Huber . Well , while he was running , Barack Obama was heard to say that he would bankrupt our coal industry . Now , I don’t doubt Washington’s ability to bankrupt almost anything in the United States . But , but China is currently adding a hundred gigs of coal electricity a year . </s>
That’s one entire United States worth of coal consumption every three years . </s>
There is no end in sight and there are other countries , all across the globe , following exactly in its footsteps . So let me say here quickly , where I end up and then try and tell you how I get there . We rich people of the planet can’t stop the other five billion poor people from burning a couple of trillion tons of carbon that they have within easy reach . We can’t even make any real dent in global emissions because the emissions are growing too fast , they involve too much involvement by very poor people who can’t easily change their ways and because those poor people are part of the same global economy as us.And if we are foolish enough , which we could well be , we will let carbon worries send our jobs to their shores and they will grow even faster and carbon emissions will grow faster still . It should go without saying , we don’t control global supply of carbon . </s>
Ten countries ruled by thoroughly nasty people control eighty per cent of the world’s oil , a trillion barrels currently worth fifty trillion dollars at current market prices . Now , if I told you that there was that value in gold where it actually is , where the oil actually is , you would scoff at any suggestion that anything we could do , no matter what we spent , could force those people to keep that oil in the ground . It’s all they’ve got . They will drill it . </s>
They will pump it . They will find a market and somebody will burn it . Poor countries all around this planet are sitting on a trillion tons of readily accessible coal . </s>
It’s all they’ve got for energy beyond the other great carbon reservoir of the planet , which is the rain forests and the soils , which they also , by and large , control . They will squeeze the carbon they can out of cheap coal , cheap forests and cheap soil , because that’s what’s there , unless they can get something even cheaper than that . And that , as I shall discuss shortly , is going to take some doing . </s>
We no longer control demand for carbon , either . The five billion poor people are already the main problem – not us . If you have heard otherwise , you have heard wrong . </s>
Collectively , the poor already emit twenty per cent more greenhouse gas than we do . We burn a lot more carbon individually , of course , but they have a lot more children . Their fecundity has beaten out our gluttony and the gap is now widening very fast . China , not the United States , is now the largest emitter of greenhouse gas on the planet and it will soon be joined by others . </s>
It’s only a matter of time . And finally , the poor countries have made perfectly clear that they are not interested at all in spending what a low carb diet would cost . They have more pressing problems . So it really does come down to this . First , can we give the world something cheaper than carbon ? </s>
The moon shot law of economics says , Why , yes , we can . If we just really put our minds to it , it will happen -- atom bomb , moon landing , energy , you name it . No , not this time . Fossil fuels are very cheap because they concentrate a lot of energy in a small space . You find a mountain of coal and you can just shovel gargantuan amounts of energy into the boxcars . </s>
Renewable fuels like sun and wind are much harder . Windmills are now fifty story skyscrapers , yet one windmill generates a piddling two megawatts . A jumbo needs a hundred megawatts to get off the ground . </s>
Google is building hundred megawatt servers just to move bits around . </s>
Meeting New York City’s total energy demand would require something like thirteen thousand windmills spinning at full speed or more like fifty thousand windmills scattered all over the state because you’ve got ta have enough of them to be sure enough of them are in the windy spots . </s>
What was your Mayor thinking when he suggested that you might just tuck them into Manhattan ? I mean , that kind of thinking betrays a very common view that , In fact , it betrays a profound ignorance about how difficult it is to get huge amounts of energy out of these very dilute , thin forms of fuel , like sun and wind . Renewable technologies are not moving down the same plummeting cost curves that we’ve seen in our laptops and our cell phones . When you replace conventional with renewable everything gets bigger , not smaller – much , much bigger – and costs get higher , not lower . China and India won’t trade three cent coal for fifteen cent wind or thirty cent solar . </s>
And if we force those expensive technologies on ourselves , we will certainly end up doing more harm than good . </s>
Twenty percent of the planet buys much less carbon , the other eighty percent will be delighted to buy at a lower price . The real jobs will go where the energy is cheap , just as they go where the labor is cheap because manufacturing and heavy industry require so much energy . And in a global economy you can’t possibly compete if you’re paying two or three times as much as your competitors for an essential input . Green jobs means Americans paying other Americans to chase carbon while the rest of the world builds power plants and factories . </s>
But the rest of the world is less efficient than us and less careful . </s>
A massive transfer of carbon and industry and jobs from us to them will raise carbon emissions . It will not lower them . So , unless we are going to ask the Pentagon to take charge – and good luck with that -- we don’t have the power to deliver any lasting reduction in global carbon emissions at all . Whatever we might achieve in the very short term at home , we can’t control the global supply of carbon . </s>
We can’t control the five billion poor people who desperately want to burn it and who already control more of the demand than we do . And we can’t control the flight of jobs and industry to where the industry is cheap . </s>
Frantically chasing the impossible and falling flat on your face doesn’t make things better . It often makes things worse and it’s never worth the money . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Peter Huber . Arguing against the motion , Adam Werbach . And in the nineties , Adam Werbach was the whiz kid of the environmentalist movement . At twenty-three he was the President of the Sierra Club . </s>
His views have evolved since then and recently he has been consulting for Wal-Mart . Ladies and gentlemen , Adam Werbach . Major carbon reductions are worth the money . Mr. Huber , I want to thank you for your novel argument , summed as , No , we can’t . You begin by saying you care about the world’s poor and then you start by saying , “The five billion poor people are the problem.” </s>
We’re going to send our jobs to their shores . </s>
They have too many children . This type of contempt will not lead us towards the world that we want to build for our kids , either here or across the world . The question at hand , and the question we face , is , Are major reductions in carbon worth the money ? </s>
And I’ll very simply give examples at the level of the economy , at the level of a corporation and the level of the individual . Not is it all investments , every investment – it’s , Are major reductions worth the money ? Mr. Huber , I read that you wrote about enhancing America’s electric power grid . </s>
That’s a great way of having great reductions in carbon in a way that’s very much worth the money . We waste about six to ten percent of all energy through America’s very inefficient electricity grid . If we invested in a smart grid it could save up to twenty billion dollars a year that’s lost through line loss . Major carbon reductions can be worth the money . Americans spend about a week a year , if they commute a lot , stuck in their cars . </s>
That costs the economy in terms of productivity and fuel costs about $ 78 billion a year . If we invested in new traffic software and signaling , public transportation to create those green jobs that you have such contempt for , um , we could in fact reduce that , greatly . Major carbon reductions are worth the money . </s>
At the level of a corporation , more and more corporations are not just doing it because it’s fashionable , they’re doing it because they’re building a strategy for sustainability to move them forward . I’ll give you a few examples . Xerox , that iconic American company , around the year 2000 was on the verge of bankruptcy , was , was at its knees , and the vultures were circling . </s>
And Ann Mulcahy , the CEO , when she took over she committed that by 2012 they would reduce their carbon output by 10 percent between 2002 and 2012 , and they started investing in remanufacturing , and today 91 percent of all the parts in Xerox machines are remanufactured or recycled , which means you don’t need to get new stuff from the earth and much better from a carbon emissions standpoint . Well by the year 2006 , they reached that 2012 goal , they reached their 10 percent reduction and they actually committed to a 25 percent reduction , by the year 2012 . Today , in 2009 , they’re at about 21 percent and they’re well on their way . There’s a company that’s more productive , that’s making more money for its shareholders , because of strict carbon restrictions . </s>
Sun Microsystems has about half of its workers telecommuting . This saves the worker a few hundred dollars , up to $ 1000 because they don’t have to commute anymore , and it saves the company money . Last year about $ 68 million in avoided costs because they didn’t have offices for all those people . </s>
People get to be more productive , they get to work in their pajamas , it’s a win-win all over the place , major reductions in their carbon use , about 30,000 metric tons saved by that , are good and worth the money . </s>
Finally a company that I do work with , Wal-Mart . Wal-Mart made three commitments in its turn-around , one , to be powered 100 percent by renewable energy which would be a major reduction in carbon . Two , to produce zero waste , which would reduce their carbon emissions . And three , to only sell green products in their stores . Major commitments by a major manufacturer . </s>
They’ve pushed this down the supply chain , it pulled energy out , lowering the cost of the products , lowering the cost to the consumer . </s>
And one of the reasons a company like Wal-Mart is doing so well right now is that they’ve become more efficient , because of a focus on major reductions in carbon . </s>
And , one of the associates I was able to work with at Wal-Mart is named Chuck Bonnett , I want to give you as an example—at an individual level , how major reductions can actually make sense . </s>
Chuck works the meat counter at Wal-Mart , and he made a personal sustainability practice commitment , to reduce the amount of carbon emissions that he had personally . </s>
A major reduction in his personal life , in carbon emissions . And he tried to figure out what to do and he was actually in line at a fast food restaurant . </s>
And as he was in this line waiting for his burger , he watched all the cars idling and thought , oh , that’s carbon . And he thought about the hamburger which had been , been frozen and shipped across , maybe across the country , perhaps across the world , and he thought about the carbon that came from the cow and the thought about the plastic that was wrapping this hamburger . And he thought you know if I cut that out , it’s not gon na only be good for my health , and he had to lose about 100 pounds , maybe I can get a discount on my health care , and actually , maybe I can save some money ‘cause I’ll cook meals at home rather than going out so much which a lot of people across the world are doing , who have the opportunity to eat out . In this case , major reductions in his own personal carbon emissions , were worth the money . </s>
Now… our opponents tend to focus on the fact that we can’t do everything . And that there are other problems and , yes , there are other problems and we need to work on them . For example , I could tell you tonight , that there are exit signs at the back of the theater and , there’s one at the side of theater and that’s probably very important in case there were a fire , but , maybe I could instead tell you about influenza , because that’s the eighth-largest killer in America and I might tell you worry about the person next to you , ‘cause they might be a little sickly . And you might need to worry about them , or maybe I could check your purses , or check your dinner reservation for later tonight because maybe , you’ll decide to go out and have a dessert or a creamy special appetizer . Because you know that heart disease is the greatest killer in America . </s>
These things are all true , but we can do two things at once , we can walk and chew gum at the same time . And the great thing about carbon , is that it’s one single thread , if you pull it , the entire sweater begins to unravel . </s>
It’s one single step that can help people save money and live better lives at their individual level , at a corporate level , and even at an economy-wide level . Major reductions in carbon are good for the economy , and are absolutely worth the money . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Adam Werbach . Arguing next for the motion , Philip Stott , professor emeritus from the University of London , his specialty carries the distinct and revealing name of biogeographer , he is an expert in many things , from the nature of fire to the behavior of soil . And tonight he is arguing for the motion . Thank you , John . Adam and colleagues , I really wish I could believe that we can manage the costs that would control climate . </s>
Very sadly , I have to quote Samuel Johnson , the great British lexicographer . “An obstinate stubbornness , a rationality , stops me believing it.” And with a twinkle in my eye , because we’re in New York and near Wall Street , what I want to show , very dangerously , is that , climate science and these costs are sub-prime science…sub-prime economics , and above all , sub-prime politics . </s>
And they will cost us dear , despite what Adam and Oliver and Hunter will be saying . And we’ve got to be very , very careful . And Bjorn used a very important phrase . Let’s not just follow what’s fashionable . In fact , Johnson again had a wonderful phrase for it . </s>
“Let’s not be befuddled , by the clamor of the times.” </s>
Let me therefore start , by science , I’m not going to say much on science because , I agree with what Robert said , right at the start in this . It’s actually not very much about the science , it’s always been about economic and political choice . </s>
Everything is when it comes down to it , like it or not . But I just want you to have one image , and it’s a very serious scientific image , I want you to think of the world…I want you to think of the world from inner Siberia , to Greenland , then to Singapore , and then come to the Arab states and to Sahara . What , ladies and gentlemen , is the temperature range I have just covered . It is from minus 20 degrees C , to nearly 50 degrees C , a range of 70 degrees C , in which humanity has adapted and learnt to live . </s>
We are talking about , ignoring the extremes that Oliver said , a prediction of 2 to 3 degrees C , what a funk ! I’m very serious , what a funk ! Humanity lives successfully from Greenland to Singapore to Saudi Arabia . 70 degrees C . And what is more , the carbon reductions will not produce an outcome that is predictable . </s>
Climate is the most complex , coupled , non- linear , chaotic system known to man . Of course there are human influences in it , nobody denies that . </s>
But what outcome will they get , by fiddling with one variable at the margins . I’m sorry , it’s scientific nonsense . </s>
And a very serious nonsense . </s>
But it’s the economics above all , because that’s the motion , the costs . </s>
I come from the left wing politically . </s>
I am fed up with environmentalists putting regressive costs and taxes on the poor . It always costs more in the end , whatever Adam and the other say , and it’s always fundamentally on the poor . They’ve forgotten the famous Jevons Paradox , Professor Jevons from my own country , University College , London , that actually when you save on energy , you don’t really save , you simply transfer it to new energy costs , and actually probably issue more CO2 . So when you save energy you take another holiday , you take another flight , your CO2 increases . </s>
And he demonstrated that in the 19th century . Have we forgotten this basic economics . But above all , it’s this . </s>
I’m going to be honest about this , I don’t trust the environmentalist agenda . For 30 to 40 years , what they have fundamentally been wanting to do , is place an infinity in cost-benefit . </s>
In other words , so that the rationality of economic choices is undermined by effectively a religious choice , not an economic choice . Under an infinity of course , choice is not made under the procedures that were put down by Peter , and by Bjorn . But it won’t work . And that leads me , it becomes a closed system of thought , and that always worries me deeply . But it’s the politics then , finally , sub-prime politics . </s>
We are full of eco-poseurs and in the United States you have some gems . I don’t think I need to mention them . But what we’ve got to remember is that , this motion is about the cost of artificially in a sense , forcing down the carbon . Energy security , efficiency , are of course they’re absolutely vital . Energy security will become of the major themes…of the Obama administration , and rightly so , but that isn’t artificially forcing down carbon . </s>
And exactly as Peter said , only this week , China announced a 30 percent increase by 2015 , in its coal production . Actually announced that only this week . </s>
And in a sense , we are not being realistic . As I said I would love to be able to think we can control climate , when of course it is indeed going to have to be adaptation , flexibility put to an outcome that we don’t know ‘cause I actually don’t know what climate , they’re wanting to produce for us . And actually I don’t think they know either . But let me come back to Johnson again , ‘cause Johnson said everything—Bible , Shakespeare and Johnson , you’ve got it . And Johnson said virtually everything . </s>
In a very , very brilliant book that he wrote in the 18th century there called Rasselas , he talks of an astronomer who claims that he can control climate . This is what he says . “The sun has listened to my dictates , and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction . </s>
The clouds at my call , have poured their waters.” And what does Johnson say about this astronomer—astronomer ? He was mad ! And so are we , if we actually believe we can control climate predictably , the costs in every sense will be enormous . Oh , mamma mia . </s>
We are the dancing queens . Let’s give this global warming nonsense , its Waterloo tonight . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Philip Stott . Finally , speaking against the motion I’d like to introduce L. Hunter Lovins . </s>
She is the founder of Natural Capitalism , an organization whose precepts are ecologically friendly development , and research tells us that Time magazine has named her a Hero of the Planet . Ladies and gentlemen , Hunter Lovins . Wow . Philip , you ought to be a preacher . </s>
You ever heard a more religious proposition ? Let’s bring it back to economics , I’m a professor of business at Presidio School of Management , and I teach my students to follow the money . Are major reductions in carbon worth the money . That’s what we’re debating , we’re not debating whether or not we can control the climate , we’re not even debating what the climate will be , we’re debating , are major reductions worth the money , and that’s the only question…for better or worse that we’re gon na talk about tonight . My company walked into a company that has big warehouses , about a million square feet of warehouse , and boxes stacked floor to ceiling . </s>
Every 10 feet in the ceiling were 500-watt light bulbs shining down on the tops of boxes . The guys who worked down below had task-lighting so they could see where they were going . We said , y’all have a switch ? </s>
$ 650,000 saved the first year , now that is not a cost , to deliver major carbon reductions . Similarly we worked with another company that has left its… 630,000 computers and monitors on 24-7 because they had an urban myth that you , uh , have to leave your computers on . And we pointed out to them that , actually , IT did not need them left on 24-7 . And a simple company policy that when you turn your computer off you turn it all the way off , saved them $ 700,000 the first year . Again , zero cost , now this is what’s called low-hanging fruit , we could half the carbon in the country . </s>
Let’s look at what we’re actually spending on carbon , this country borrows somewhere between a billion and $ 2 billion a day to buy oil , we borrow the money from the Chinese , and we send it to the Saudis , as Jim Woolsey who used to run the CIA , we’re fighting both sides of the war on terror , we pay for our guys and we send money to the guys who pay for the other guys , now this is daft . We know how to eliminate , at least three quarters of that oil , just through smarter technology , so now you and I and the rest of American taxpayers are gon na bail out Detroit because they failed to do this . How about we attach a little string to that money , if we’re gon na own the car companies now , let’s ask them to build the state of the art cars . Any of you ever seen a Tesla ? </s>
You wan na go real fast ? Yeah . We can build safer , faster , peppier , sportier , better cars , that use no energy , now , electric car , okay , you go to Google . Google recently decided that they could make all of their parking lots carports with solar on ‘em…pay back within 10 years , oh , 10 years is a long time , no it’s not . A two-year payback which is what people say they demand , is a 70 percent return on investment . </s>
You guys on Wall Street , you tell me where you can get 70 percent return on investment in today’s market . So Google put in these solar -- and they have little pull-down plugs , you bring your electric car , you plug it in . My next car’s gon na be a plug-in hybrid . My friend Jim Woolsey , the ex-head of the CIA , drives a plug-in hybrid he runs on solar on his roof . Has a little bumper sticker on it , “Osama bin Laden hates my car.” </s>
Major reductions in carbon are worth the money . Chicago Climate Exchange , this is a voluntary group of now over 400 businesses , my company is a member…who have pledged to cut their carbon . </s>
They have reduced carbon…collectively 8 percent . There’s no law that says they have to , you don’t need taxes , you don’t need Draconian regulation . We simply need to be smart about how we use energy . They represent companies , 20 percent of the Dow Jones industrials , and 17 percent of stationery emissions in this country . </s>
California , AB-32 , new study out from the University of California , fully implementing the Republican Governor Schwarzenegger’s cap on carbon . And trading regime…would deliver to California $ 78 billion , in increased state gross product . </s>
$ 78 billion , and 400,000 new jobs . Florida , another Republican governor , Republican task force study , that cutting carbon emissions 51 percent below the business-as-usual projections , would add $ 28 billion to state gross product , several hundred thousand new jobs . Arizona , even more , 60-some percent cut below now , $ 5 billion and 200,000 new jobs , there are now studies from 20 states , you add it up…if this country implemented aggressive climate protection measures , 500 billion in increased savings to the country , and 5 million green jobs . </s>
That’s where the 5 million green jobs number comes from . So let’s bring it home . 4 Times Square down the , down the road ? Looks like a normal building , costs the same to build , uses half the energy , gets its energy from photo-voltaics in the skin of the building , and a fuel cell in the basement . </s>
This building can never be turned off . So in the 2003 northeast blackout , remember that ? People came from blocks around to camp out underneath it . Genuine homeland security , if we want security , if we want an economy , we wan na have jobs in this country , we will invest in energy efficiency and renewable energy . Because it’s what gives us the greatest rate of return . </s>
Oh , and it also solves the climate problem , assuming there is one . But let’s assume the climate skeptics are right . </s>
Everything you would do if you were simply a profit-maximizing capitalist , is exactly what you would do if you were scared to death about climate change . </s>
A little company across the river , Voltaics . My friend Peter De Nuvila’s chair of this little company , they make the gas precursors for photo-voltaics . Because they’re selling a lotta their gases to China , they are now a net exporter—they’re making their county a net exporter to China . Again , if we want an economy , we can unleash the greatest…prosperity humanity has ever known . </s>
And Bjorn , I share your , your care for people in developing countries , where are we gon na get the money ? We’re gon na get it because we’re going to invest in renewable energy , energy efficiency , and those investments are worth the money . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Very nice , thank you—thank you , Hunter Lovins . And may we just applaud all of our panelists for the presentations that they’ve gone through , thank you . </s>
So , where we are in the debate , the time period of uninterrupted speaking is over , we’re going to move into the portion of the evening now where the debaters debate one another , and we are going to call on you the audience shortly to help along that process with your questions but first , as you recall , when you came in this evening we polled you about your view on the motion and we will poll you again after the debate but I have the results that have come in now . Reminding you , our motion is , major carbon emissions—major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money . The results are interesting . In support of this motion , 16 percent . </s>
Against the motion , 49 percent , and that leaves 35 percent undecided . And reminding you also that as we say this is a contest to change your mind so that “undecided” becomes very important , if that shrinks , the winner will most likely be determined by whom that goes on . So , I’d like to now come to your questions and what I’m going to do in the beginning is maybe collect two or three and get a sense of the room that way and then begin to put those questions to the panel , so if you wan na just— If you’re ready to ask a question you can raise your hand and I’ll find you , and I see down—right down front…third row… Thank you . </s>
Is the mic on ? </s>
Now , I think your mic is now on . Okay . Yes . </s>
My question derives from my confusion about the definition of the term , “major.” Which two of the panelists for the motion— or against the motion rather , have defined as being individual cost- efficiency , it’s what used to be known as being Scottish and frugal . And , but , Mr. Rosenkranz in introducing the debate spoke about Kyoto II , and the cap-and-trade of effectively tax through auction , that would be imposed constituting he said 2 percent of the GNP of the global economy . That’s a huge amount of money and I was curious under that scheme , who would control those dollars , who would allocate them , and where would the accountability be . </s>
All right . I’d like to go to—I’m gon na reserve that , and collect a couple more questions , anybody up the aisle here… ? </s>
On the far side , woman in the green jacket ? I notice that the panelists who were in favor of the motion spoke a lot about other nations in the world that are not subject to our constraints or , simply aren’t interested in them , as far as we can tell , and the proponents for , mostly talked about what’s going on in the United States , so I’d like to see what the “for” proponents think about the global situation , taking into account China , et cetera . Okay , one more ? </s>
Uh , front row . White jacket ? Well , many environmental impacts such as carbon emissions are merely treated as externalities in terms of economic costs . </s>
Al Gore however suggests that these carbon emissions are treated as total economic costs . How greatly would American industries be affected if these environmental impacts were treated as costs rather than externalities . And do you direct that question to anyone in particular ? Um…probably the people for the motion . Okay , let’s start , let’s work in reverse order , and Bjorn , would you like to take that last question ? </s>
Yeah , and clearly I think any economist would say that we need to actually make sure that the externality , the thing that you don’t pay for , that you actually end up paying for it . But you also have to have a realistic sense of it , and that’s of course where we need to talk , not just about what works , and in particular , companies , but what actually works for the economy . If you look across all the different studies , and Professor Richard Tol has done so , and it’s the latest and the only global survey of all the costs of what is an extra ton of CO2 causing of damage in the world , the answer is that’s about $ 7 per ton of CO2 . That translates pretty much into 6 cents per gallon of gasoline . So yes , we should have a carbon tax , that’s not what actually gon na do anything majorly for or against our emissions . </s>
Oliver Tickell , what did you hear in that answer ? Well , I think that the—this whole question that , of paying for externalities associated with carbon emissions is absolutely crucial . And then , you get to the point of if people do pay for externalities in the form perhaps of a carbon tax or an auction price of carbon permits under a cap-and-trade system , what then happens to those funds that are raised . </s>
And clearly , there are two ways to go , there is adaptation , there is mitigation , but the greatest of these is mitigation . Because the best way that we can serve the victims and potential victims of climate change , is by making sure that it does not happen . Philip Stott , what’s this head-shake— Oh— —so you’re gon na — </s>
You—you’re never going to stop climate change , can we just kill one thing off . Climate will change without us or with us . And that’s where Bjorn is right . </s>
Bjorn—Bjorn is right because always it’s going to have to aid adaptation . </s>
If in any way we impoverish ourselves so we can not help the developing world , that would indeed be a moral mistake of mammoth proportions— Whoa , nobody’s talking about impoverishing ourselves , we are talking about the generation of wealth through smart investments . Now your question of , who’s gon na spend the money…most of the people that are proposed to spend the money , whether it be the UN or the US government or anybody’s government , I think they’re gon na spend it badly . </s>
How about we set incentives to enable the business community to do what it is already doing , which is decarbonizing , because it’s in their economic interest— But—but , Hunter , I love the loucheness of saying , oh , this is gon na be free , we are gon na make money off of this . I love the fact that you want to reintroduce into the American public the idea of a profit-maximizing CEO . I think that’s a good idea . But honestly , I think you already have that . </s>
The point is , how are we gon na get beyond that , and that is gon na be costly and Europe has shown the way . It’s not costly— But , Bjorn , costly , I mean the question went to the matter of a 2 percent of— Yeah— —GNP , that is enormously costly . </s>
Yeah , and that is what the UN is telling us that the cost is probably gon na be . I mean , you have a discussion about is it gon na be 1 , is it gon na be 3 percent , but it’s definitely gon na be hugely costly , and simply making these stories that some companies can make money , hey , great . </s>
And presumably we don’t have to do anything to make them make money . But—Bjorn— </s>
But the real question is— Please— —where are we gon na get the rest of the cuts— One of the absolute key things here is actually to address the very agenda that you’ve put forward of huge spending into research and development— </s>
Yep— —for renewable technology , and the strange things is that you put that forward as if it were some kind of an alternative to cutting carbon but in fact it’s a very important aspect of how you set about cutting carbon emissions . Where you’re wrong with that , it is a necessary part but not sufficient because there are two components , there’s research-and-development , and then there is making sure that it happens on a sufficiently large scale to get the economies of mass production , which are real , and we know in the case of solar PV , that the cost falls 20 percent , for every doubling of production , we see in the New York Times today , that the cost to Americans of installing solar PV is half of what it used to be , as a result in part of these kind of cost savings— Oliver , we’re not disagreeing with you on that— </s>
We need—this is the situation that we need to bring about , and as the costs come down , through research , through development , through mass production , through large-scale deployment , we are bringing— But Oliver— —— Nobody on this panel , nobody on this panel is against increasing energy efficiency and energy security , it’s the most sensible thing of all . But if you’re making the marker of it , always what is precisely happening to carbon , A , you’re not gon na do it , and I’m sorry to say you’re not actually going to do it for a reason I’ll just mention in a second , but also , you’re—the real issue is how are we going to have enough energy of all types , not just to keep the US going , but above all from my point of view , for the developing world . </s>
That is to me absolutely crucial— Absolutely— But let’s talk about the developing world and how you— </s>
Yeah , but— —how you meet their energy needs . </s>
Frankly they— How they meet energy needs— With energy— The developing world—the developing world— </s>
Peter Huber , let’s hear from Peter Huber , please— We know how they’re meeting their energy needs , they are taking down the rainforest , they are soaking carbon out of their land , and they are burning coal , I mean we actually know this—you know , all this talk about externalities— If you don’t know this , the Kyoto system divides the world . I didn’t do this , they did it , they divide it into 20-80 , okay ? </s>
Everything on the 20 , nothing on the 80 . How can we even talk about externalities—if we said to you , folks , we’re getting an externality system worked out for this group just right here , but it’s only this group here , all the rest of you do what you like , what do you think would work with that system , nothing would work . </s>
Interesting and totally off the point of are major cuts in carbon worth the money . Take Afghanistan where I work . You and I and the rest of American taxpayers this winter will spend something like $ 80 million , buying diesel to run the North Kabul power planet , that diesel trucked over the Khyber Pass , fat target . </s>
If instead , we enabled the Afghans by training , by technology transfer , to grow oil crops , like getropha , or sunflowers , or nut crops , take the oil and make it into biodeisel , they would have a viable industry , they would have jobs , and we would not be paying for the diesel— Right . —to pollute the air in Kabul . Now yes , this would be an expenditure of money . </s>
It would enhance national security for us , and if in fact we don’t deliver genuine development to the Afghans , we will get our heads handed to us— </s>
But Hunter , what about the impact of biofuel development for this , on the need , even greater need to increase world food supply . </s>
You’re taking land now increasingly for biofuels to increase world food supply , it is a competitive choice— </s>
Only because you’re doing it stupidly and because— No— —we are subsidizing it . No . No— Yeah . </s>
We are— You are subsidizing it , but , in fact the seriousness all the way through from Malaysia for example to Indonesia et cetera , the impact is potential , in fact some people argue , it is now one of the most serious pressures causing in fact reduction in world food supply . But I’m not trying to defend— —at a time , when we have to— Bjorn—Bjorn Lomborg , let’s have— </s>
Well— </s>
—Bjorn— —I just want us to bring us back to having a conversation and Hunter was actually very good at that . We need to get back to business , this is not about who can come up with the smartest story or the most endearing cute little tale . This is about how can we do this in the world . And the economists have done those studies , and they have shown that this has real and significant costs , on the of , you know , 1 to 3 or 4 percent of GDP . </s>
But I think you miss the difference— The question is— —between a cost and an investment— </s>
—do you want to spend that much money— Well , but the problem is , it’s not an investment if it doesn’t actually pay back more and that’s of course the whole question . Are we doing a lot of good for the world— </s>
Adam Werbach , against the motion— </s>
I love the fact that we’re being— —speaking against the motion . </s>
I enjoy the conversation , I mean two , three years ago we were arguing about whether climate change was real . And now we’ve moved beyond that , now the question is should there be a carbon cap , that seems to be , or should it just be investments in things that actually bring down the cost of energy for everyone . Okay , well I agree that we should be investing and bringing down the cost for everyone . Now , then the debate is , are major reductions in carbon necessary , do we actually need a cap as well . </s>
Well for the companies I work with and for governments , they actually want the rules set . We know what happens when the rules aren’t set . But what’s happening when the rules are not set is we see companies…and like , we’ve just seen in Wall Street . </s>
But Adam— —we’ve seen , without an effective SEC , with an effective regulatory framework , people can invest and there’s no guarantee for the investment— </s>
But—but Adam , your side itself is proposing no cap on 80 percent of the world that currently generates fifty— But—no , I am saying— </s>
—54 percent— Wait—we are not proposing that— 54 percent of , of the— </s>
This is— </s>
—the greenhouse gases . This is the old Kyoto system and I don’t think any of us is supporting that . John , could we just answer the word “major , ” which seemed to be the really— Yes , I was gon na come right to that— —serious question that the lady here asked . </s>
If I’m being quite honest about major , to influence climate in any way , you fundamentally would have to throw 4 billion people out of work . You’d have to keep every ounce of coal in the ground , every ounce of oil in the ground , and let’s be absolutely frank , it isn’t going to happen . Because , the impact of anything less from changing your light bulbs to biofuels , is absolutely nonexistent on climate , and that’s my point . If it were truly worth doing , the costs would be right . </s>
But it won’t work on climate . Now , Philip , I would really like to take you up on the point here because I think that what we’re seeing here , when we began , the introduction that was given was that your side accepted the fundamental reality of climate change caused by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere but all you’ve done is to deny it . No— Panel , there—there has been a tendency to , I think almost accuse the other side of intellectual dishonesty . Philip , you used the term “junk science.” </s>
Adam— </s>
I didn’t— —you , you accused— </s>
No , no , no , I didn’t— </s>
—Peter Huber of contempt . Bjorn , you accused Oliver Tickell of doom-mongering— That’s what I’ve been doing— </s>
Do , do , do— Do you in fact— Adam , do you think your other side , your opponents’ arguments are intellectually dishonest ? Well , that’s for them to decided in their consciences tonight . But , um— </s>
No , no , actually— </s>
But I do—but the ques— —it’s a question to you . But the question I guess—I accused my opponent of contempt . And when someone says 5 billion poor people are the problem , and that’s—that was a direct quote from what he said , that is a contemptuous statement . “Our jobs sent to their shores.” </s>
That is a contemptuous statement . I don’t—I think that is a fact . </s>
Well , if anybody took— Peter Huber— </s>
—a discussion of jobs as contempt , I truly apologize , I feel no contempt , I’m trying to talk about macro-economic effects in a global economy , you know , many people feel there is a global economy and things do move like that . As for saying , you know , their fecundity has beaten our gluttony , I don’t know which is ruder , to be , you know , gross and eat too much , or to have lots of children , but I don’t mean any contempt by it , I’m just saying it is an actual fact . Philip Stott— It really is the truth— Philip Stott speaking for the motion— </s>
Yeah , John , one of the great things about the Rosenkranz Foundation debates is precisely that they assume that each side respects the position of the other , and one of the great things about this debate is that I’m hearing all these arguments , I actually am happy to respect the position , and in fact one of the terrible things that has happened recently , is the attempt to close down debate , and in fact to attack people , with the use of extremely un—not my colleagues here , extremely unpleasant language . </s>
It is absolutely that debate is vital on a topic like this , it’s vigorous of course , Hunter and I are gon na go at each other .

“This global warming nonsense”— Cost nonsense , very different— “This global warming nonsense , ” I wrote it down , you spoke of CO2— </s>
No , global warming costs— —as a single variable on the market— Yes , absolutely . Bjorn Lomborg said major carbon cuts will do little to change the temperature and nothing to save the world , this is in fact a denialism— No— </s>

I’m gon na go for some more questions— </s>
Which are— —because I—we’re in a little bit of a circular loop on this one— Yeah , I agree . An impasse , I would say . Right in the middle , you might need to…would you be comfortable in walking out , thanks . </s>
That’s wise , the microphone’s coming in to you . There it is . I just wanted to sort of start by saying that we seem to have come round , sort of…intellectual dishonesty and it’s all about economics versus science and so I wan na start out with just saying , I’m an economist and I have a question . Whether this is still about sort of economics or not , and I wan na sort of direct this question to Bjorn Lomborg . Mm-hmm . </s>
You stated that the Copenhagen Consensus favored technology , R-and-D investment . However , isn’t it true that the economists that you are so eagerly quoting as the great work that they’ve done , have basically publicly distanced themselves from your interpretation of their work , and I’m talking about Richard Tol and Gary Yohe . So basically , they say that they actually never looked at that , they looked at a climate-mix policy , which would have adaptation , mitigation , and R-and-D technology , which is the point that Oliver Tickell made . </s>
Thank you— Bjorn , I’m not gon na leave that hanging out there , go right to it . Sure . You’ve unfortunately read half of the discussion because it’s true , that they first made a comment in , in The Guardian and then later on , after we’d had a long discussion on a blog , we actually , Yohe and I wrote a joint column , where we pointed out what it was we said . Yes , Yohe , and to a certain extent Tol , believe that it’s also a good idea that we invest , and remember , it is mainly investing in research and development but also investing in carbon reductions right now . </s>
There was another party , Professor Green , who made the argument that we should be investing much more in research and development and then only much later invest in cutting carbon emissions . What came out of the Copenhagen Consensus where we had eight of the world’s top economists , including five Nobel laureates , looking at all that stuff , they said , well , if you look just in carbon reductions which is what we talk about here tonight , that probably pays less than $ 1 back on the dollar . Whereas if we invest in research and development , it probably does $ 11 worth of good for every dollar . And that’s the main reason— But Bjorn , this is a completely false choice— </s>
—why we’re making this point— —this is another one of your false choices , we—there is no choice here , we absolutely need— No , no , that’s , and that— —to invest in R-and-D in order to achieve these cuts in greenhouse emissions— </s>
And this is the brilliant , and very , very good demonstration , that Oliver Tickell can’t see anything that we shouldn’t be spending money on and say let’s spend money on it . I would suggest that we should spend money— </s>
I’m agreeing with you , Bjorn , we need to spend that— —on things that give us $ 11 of good in the world , but we don’t spend a dollar for every time we just get 90 cents back on— </s>
In The New Yorker last week— Philip Stott . </s>
In The New Yorker last week , your own magazine , a very liberal magazine and one I love , very interestingly , there was a fascinating statement , which that , you can’t effectively do dual or multi-instruments politically , to answer say both poverty and climate change , and the—I love the analogy that was given by the professor quoted , it was a very good one . I might wish to save energy and I’ve invited you all round for dinner , be very nice to meet you all for dinner , but in fact , I’m going to cook my pizzas and all the rest of it , in the shower so I’m going to save energy . Of course you’re going to end up with a very , very rotten dinner , and I think this is at the heart of what we’re discussing here , how far do— How far do dual instruments and multi-instruments actually work , and I think , it’s when I do passionately disagree with Oliver on this . Because , let’s be honest , in our own households and everything , we have a given income , we have to make very , very difficult choices . </s>
If I know what I would put my choices by the way , very simply , and they would tie in , not because I’m supporting Bjorn particularly on this because they—I came to this decision a long— I am very worried indeed about the whole state of the development of new viruses in the world at the moment , they are all very serious problems . And if you look historically , the single biggest effects that have created deaths amongst humanity , have been the evolution of new viruses , new bacteria , and new forms . And that’s the crucial point . Across the— </s>

It’s not irrelevant , not irrelevant— Let me go to what you invest and what you get . Little company across the river , Ferrara Construction , put solar panels on the top of its building . It now has a net-zero building . Which means that it is sending back to the grid more energy than it is using . </s>
They are selling the energy for about $ 1.11 per square foot , as opposed to paying two bucks 30 a square foot , which they had previously been doing , to buy their electricity from the grid . Now , spread this across the country , Southern California Edison , recently built a 250-megawatt power plants on roofs , spread around the county , at a price point of $ 875 million . A coal plant was recently canceled in Montana at a price point of about $ 800 million . </s>
Very close— But Hunter , Hunter , the— </s>
We are very near what’s called , grid parity , where the solar technologies are actually cheaper— But Hunter— —than generating electricity through coal— Bjorn , take this but take it briefly— —which is why I don’t believe the numbers that China is going to build all these coal plants . </s>
You know who the world’s first green billionaire is ? He’s a Chinese solar entrepreneur . They have just announced that they’re going to increase— Yeah— —they’ve just announced— </s>
Bjorn—Philip— —their official spokesman— </s>
—I wan na give Bjorn a chance ‘cause you— </s>
Yes— —had a—quite a chance so far— </s>
Yeah I have , but just , it’s crucial this , that China has just announced a 30 percent increase . They’ve just announced it . Okay . Hmm . </s>
Bjorn— And has just announced— —let me—I want Bjorn to speak and then I wan na go to questions— Yes— </s>
—the gentleman up there , you can be ready— And the bottom line is , if Hunter is right , and everybody makes money off of this , cool , we can all go home , we don’t need to worry about it because it’ll happen . Absolutely— </s>
But the real question is— </s>
No it won’t because— —we know— </s>
—we invest— No , no , Hunter , please let me— —240 million dollar—billion dollars a year in subsidies , to the conventional technologies . Right . </s>
And that’s what’s getting in the way of unleashing this new energy economy . </s>
No . The real point here is to say , are we gon na go further than that , and we know , and this is of course also what you accept , we know that the emissions scenarios expect dramatic increases in CO2 , and what you’re saying is , over and above all these great inventions that you describe and everybody else has been talking on the other side of the panel , over and above that , we have to cut dramatically . That’s what costs money . That’s the discussion that we’re having money . Gentleman in the middle of the hall , please— </s>
Honestly , the real question is , is that worth it— Yes , come on out— And my question is still , are we spending trillions of dollars to do virtually no good a hundred years from now , I’m sorry , Oliver , that’s not actually— We’re going to a question now with this gentleman— —misrepresenting science . </s>
Please . </s>
You know , it’s clear that is a global problem , everybody agrees on that . </s>
But impacts and return on investment do matter . So in the face of 3 to 4 percent GDP , I’d like to ask the folks who are arguing against the motion . What in a legal context , or an enforceability stand—from an enforceability standpoint , would you expect that we can actually do about China , India and the developing world . </s>
Adam Werbach . Well the first— The first false choice that is placed here , is deciding that China needs to be constrained first , I mean , the greatest challenge and I—Mr . Lomborg and I would agree here , the greatest challenge that’s facing the people of China is that too many of them don’t have enough energy . They need a lot more of it . And we have a moral , a just cause , to make sure that everyone can live on the planet and there’ll be 9 billion of us by 2040 , with enough energy to be able to live . </s>
So , I actually far expect our carbon emissions to increase—recession-depression notwithstanding , right now , as we try to get those people to energy parity , they live in energy deficit . And our first priority , one of the reasons I believe so much in investing right now , is because we need to create technologies that can make the case . Now , what type of constraints would be put on China , well China obviously is interested in that as well . </s>
And China as it begins to invest and succeed as Hunter mentioned in one of their entrepreneurs , in building these sort of renewable technologies , is gon na be very interested in dealing with the air pollution because in Chinese cities they’re very concerned about air pollution right now and they know that comes from coal plants and they’re concerned about dealing with that . So they’re highly motivated to , to reach the point of energy parity , a place where everyone has enough energy , and then to ratchet down both the CO2 emissions , the air particulate matter emissions , and all those sorts of negative consequences that come from it . Peter Huber , do you— </s>
You know , there is no field of policy you will ever find and I spent 25 years in Washington watching this , where you will find a greater gap between what people actually do , and what they say they’re gon na do , wan na do , should do , oughta do . </s>
The EU itself , the people who are most frantic about this and who signed this stuff , they’re not—none of them or possibly one of them will meet their Kyoto commitments . They issued tradable permits , and promptly depressed the value to virtually zero because they issued so many , they were all worried about job-export issues . </s>
I mean , you know , you just can not talk about what people are gon na do for anything . China is , in fact , building coal plants like crazy . </s>
Okay ? </s>
They say they’re gon na build more but I couldn’t care less what they say . </s>
They are actually doing it . They are the world’s biggest emitter today . How can you ignore the world’s biggest emitter ? </s>
Well , but I mean , there’s a few things I’ll let you go . And surely one key thing is that a very large part of this coal that’s being burnt in China is actually producing products for export to America and to the European countries . And so you’ll tax our plants but not theirs , right ? And it’s important to recognize that . </s>
Another thing , let’s look at what China is actually doing . China is investing hugely in renewables . China has already got the world’s biggest solar tank industries . China is investing hugely in wind turbines . They are building more and more of the world’s turbines and bringing the cost of turbines down . </s>
And yes , they may indeed be mining more coal but much of that is surely displacing imports -- and from Indonesia and Australia . Philip Stott , Philip Stott . Well , I do n't want to talk about – Let me just mention briefly Europe . An absolute failure under the Kyoto Protocol . Talks a lot , have not </s>
We’re not debating Kyoto . No . What we’re debating is the effectiveness of major cost . Europe – MAN ... has failed utterly , for economic and political reasons , to cut . </s>
Some of the figures -- from Spain , from Italy , from Ireland -- are just mind blowing . And this is what I just , we’re in a cloud , cuckoo land here . And let me just make a point about this . </s>
We’re worried about China , yet worry about the E.U . now on this . Half the E.U . now is opposing the E.U.’s policy on cutting carbon . Listen to the Czech President , for example . That’s Vaclav Klaus , who is the current President of the E.U . </s>
Why do you think the recent E.U . policies have collapsed virtually ? Don’t think Europe , don’t think it’s just China or India . Don’t take the , what Europe says . Europe talks but it’s not walking the walk . </s>
MAN Hunter , Hunter Lovins , please . Hunter Lovins against the motion . You know what’s gon na get China to cut its carbon emissions ? It’s not gon na be you and me and it’s not gon na be the government . </s>
It’s gon na be Wal-Mart , which recently said to its Chinese suppliers , You will report your carbon footprint through a little group called The Carbon Disclosure Project . </s>
Who are they ? It’s a little group , a little non-profit out of the U.K. that a few years back sent out a survey to The Financial Times 500 -- the five hundred biggest companies on earth – saying , What’s your carbon footprint ? </s>
And for a couple of years everybody ignored it , until three years ago , when sixty percent of the world’s largest companies answered the survey . Last year it was seventy- seven percent . </s>
Why ? They represent institutional investors with over forty-one trillion dollars in assets . You’re gon na go to the capital marketplace , you better answer their survey . And under Sarbanes-Oxley , the new U.S. corporate ethics law , if as a manager you fail to disclose to shareholders information that can materially affect the value of stock , you can be personally criminally liable . </s>
What’s your carbon footprint ? Watch China’s emissions start to come down – ... simply because that’s the way the best companies are doing business now . </s>
Well , I love the way you think that Wal-Mart is actually gon na go and say , Oh , they produce a lot of carbon . Let’s call -- let’s buy stuff that costs a lot more from someone who don’t produce as much carbon . </s>
Obviously , Wal-Mart can do that but I don’t think they’ll stay in business . Let me also just point out two things . I thought it was very rare to see that Adam was actually – I’m not sure to what extent it was conscious , but he was actually agreeing with us , which is really nice . </s>
You should come over here . He was basically saying , China is going to go and emit much , much more . Then they’re gon na be careful and they care a lot about air pollution . And that’s absolutely true . Then he sort of slipped in , and they’re gon na cut carbon emissions . </s>
Uh , no , of course not . They’re gon na put scrubbers on their coal plants , which is really smart . </s>
But they’re not gon na care about their carbon emissions for a long term . And I would just like , the last point also – do you remember how Hunter told us about the first Chinese billionaire is a guy who produces solar panels ? Do you know who he sells those solar panels to ? He sells them to Germany . </s>
They’ve actually bought a hundred and fifty-six billion dollars worth of solar panels . Do you know how much good that’s gon na do ? By the end of this century that will postpone global warming by one hour . No , this is complete rubbish . I’m simply asking you , is that the way we want to help the world ? </s>
This is complete rubbish . </s>
This is complete rubbish because Germany has been doing the most enormous favor to the world by buying these panels , by – No . </s>
... getting them into mass production and by Let him finish . ... for everybody . Question from the rear , please . </s>
Germany has the biggest brown coal plants in the world . Philip . They’re the single most polluting coal plants . Question from the rear , please . To my ear those against the motion are not being , are not confronting the choices that are necessary . </s>
And , uh , and it’s been sort of a flagrantly anecdotal presentation . And I would suppose that , first of all , I want to say that , um , Hunter , Hunter actually said , whether she realizes it or not , during her presentation , the initial presentation , that there were , it , that the , what they have in mind would require neither major chances in taxation or major changes in regulation . Now , if , if that’s it then why are we having the debate and let’s go on . </s>
Is that your question ? I don’t think that’s – My question is , for anyone on that side , to honestly address the real tradeoffs that we’re talking about , if we’re talking about one or two or three percent of gross , gross international product or whatever the other major changes are . If there aren’t major tradeoffs then we shouldn’t be having the debate and I think they’ve been denying the tradeoffs all throughout the debate . Oliver Tickell , please . </s>
All you folks are agreed that there are tradeoffs and that there are some aspects of moving to a low carbon economy which actually produce a net gain . </s>
Your negative costs are low hanging fruit , but there are other areas where there are real costs – at least in the short term . The important thing is that as you progress from the short term through to the medium term you find that the investments that you’re making in renewable energy technology , for example , and in mass production , developing the engineering expertise to bring costs down -- that actually over the medium term , these shift from being a cost to being a benefit . And the nature of that benefit is a lot more than just the carbon . There are many , many benefits , such as air pollution . </s>
What is the world’s biggest source of arsenic and mercury in the environment ? It is burning coal . What do you say to all , to the absolutely disgusting images that we see of mountaintop removal in Appalachia in order to reach coal seams ? What do you think of the wars that are being waged in the Middle East where the thirst for fossil fuels and oil fundamentally underlies them ? There are many benefits in moving away from that kind of world into a world which is actually characterized by cooperation on energy because if we move large scale to renewable energy it requires cooperation among countries with different kinds of intermittent renewables balancing out supplies over long distance grids . </s>
And that will actually fundamentally change the whole way in which countries interact with each other . It’ll produce not just a greener world , a cleaner world , but actually a safer world and a happier world . And these are values surely worth aspiring to . </s>
Bjorn Lomborg . Since I was – The basic problem – Sorry . </s>
Since I was directly attacked , can I have a bite at that one ? Yes , because – Thank you . ... you were directly attacked . And then Bjorn . </s>
And I’d like , in the meantime , to move the camera to the side because I’m going to take a question from the woman in the blue sweater . Other tradeoffs – not if we do it intelligently . Markets work . Let’s use them . Study after study after study after study has shown that we can meet the needs of a world population of nine billion , meet the energy needs with efficiency and renewables . </s>
The Paley Commission of the U.S. government in the 1950s then urged an immediate transition to energy efficiency in renewables as a matter of urgent national security . </s>
Had we done it then we would not be having this debate now because we would not be burning carbon . Can , how do we do it ? Yeah , that definitely takes some exquisite economics , planning . </s>
I’m not a big fan of Kyoto and I am on record betting the Danish Energy Minister a bottle of whiskey that COP 15 will fail , that the effort by the world to come up with a Where-do-we-go-from-Kyoto ? will fail . And then I think we’ll have the real debate , which is , How do we use the enormous power of markets to unleash innovation around the world to enable the poor people to meet their own energy needs with their own resources , their own intelligence and to enable us to have the prosperity that , again , study after study after study has shown that we can have , if we invest now in the smartest technologies . </s>
Bjorn Lomborg . Bjorn Lomborg . I find it a little bizarre to refer to a study in the 1950s that show that we could actually have done this cheaply but we just failed to do so . Maybe that’s because it’s very , very hard and actually very costly . </s>
And that is , unfortunately -- I’m sorry , Hunter – what all the global cost benefit in ... analyses show . But let me just point out to Oliver – because he very eloquently put how we should invest in all this and this is a great deal . </s>
Notice what Germany has done . It’s spent a hundred and fifty-six billion dollars on buying very inefficient solar technology . The thing I don’t understand is why didn’t they just invest one/tenth of that in actually making solar panels much better ? </s>
That would have really made a difference and that would have made it easier for the Chinese and everybody else to get solar panels cheaper , faster . And the other thing I want to point out is just , it’s terrible – </s>
Let , let me just finish . </s>
The other thing is that it’s terrible to say this is gon na help -- </s>
Bjorn , Bjorn and Oliver – when you’re speaking simultaneously no one can hear you . Yeah . </s>
You had a shot at it . Let Oliver respond . Yeah , Bjorn , you just asked me a question and I have an answer , which is that that’s what private investors are doing . </s>
This is what the solar power companies are doing because they see here is the demand from Germany . And therefore , they are investing . This is private investment . This is companies – No , the – And – </s>
-- that are investing because they see a market . And that is why The New York Times reported today that the cost of solar panels is falling dramatically . No , no . </s>
The International Energy Agency has actually shown that the investment in renewables have gone down , not up , globally . And I’m sorry , that’s because we are so focused on cutting carbon emissions that everybody worries about how we can get through the next five years , not how we’re gon na get through the next fifty </s>
Investment in everything has collapsed . It’s called the credit crunch , Bjorn . Oliver , please . Question from the front left . </s>
Yeah . made the point that he’s in favor of research and development for low carbon technologies . </s>
And you’ve just made a couple of , of comparisons of tradeoffs between what might be worth it and what else might not be worth it . So it seems to me that we’re not necessarily debating whether reducing carbon is worth is but really how much it’s worth . So my question for the whole , for your panel is , Where do you draw the line between major reductions that for you are not worth it and what is worth it ? Peter Huber . </s>
Well , let me start by saying this : There is a very big difference between saying we ought to keep studying something and saying we ought to put in place forcible mechanisms today that will force people to adopt technology today . All right ? Because , you know , you can talk all you like about solar . The price point you’ve got ta beat is three cent coal . If you don’t beat three cent coal you’re not there . </s>
It is of no interest that you can beat , it’s of no interest that you can beat fourteen cent gas , okay ? , or , it’s – </s>
Excuse me , Peter , the coal industry itself says that new coal plants will cost thirteen or fifteen cents . </s>
Well , the , the old ones – and not in China they don’t . Believe me , okay ? </s>
The marginal cost of coal generation is miniscule and that’s your price point . </s>
Now , researching to see if you can beat it someday – I like that . I’m a techno utopian . </s>
Anybody who reads anything I say , I love technology . I’ve , in my book I say , Someday we’ll get there . But , you know , telling people today , You go ram it into twenty percent of the country – I don’t want to repeat myself . We will move these same industries over to China , as in fact it was just being suggested a moment ago , and they will make the products instead and make them dirtier . We will increase carbon emissions that way . </s>
MAN If we keep it at home at least we’ll have the scrubbers on the darn coal plants , even if we’re not taking the carbon out yet . We have time for one more question . Gentleman , young man , yes . Can you stand so that they know that I’m speaking to you ? Thank you . </s>
And a mic will travel to you . </s>
Um , hi . I have one very brief question and then another thing that I kinda want to , I’ll see if I can lump them in . One thing that hasn’t been addressed yet at all is peak oil . </s>
And I just want to kind of get that out there and see what some general reactions are . I know we’re planning on approaching that , at least within the next century – probably more likely within the next forty or fifty years . And that’s going to obviously affect our economy and the demand and supply that we have right now . </s>
And for people who don’t know what peak oil refers to -- Peak oil is when we’ve hit , we’ve used up half of the world’s oil supply and beyond that the rate of production slows dramatically . It kind of falls off on a bell curve . And then also , I wanted to , I , I know this twenty/eighty has been brought up a lot , this percentage that , that’s mentioned – the Kyoto Protocol . And for me , I just kind of wonder how long are we going to keep using , uh , that as an excuse to not lead the way for developing countries , once they are developed and they’re looking to us for the next step and the only thing that we have to say is , Look back at other developing countries and stand still ? </s>
But , could I take a first , could I take a crack at peak oil ? </s>
Actually , I would like to go to Philip Stott . Sorry . </s>
It’s a very fine question . Thank you for the peak oil question . Because , of course , we’re obsessed with oil , but of course , there 's gas and above all , as Peter has emphasized , coal . </s>
And it all depends on price again . Just remember how the dreaded state , the apartheid state of South Africa , actually survived the European , um , uh , embargoes , for example . It was , of course , by turning coal into oil . </s>
And there are vast coal reserves . When we , we’re obsessed with the oil , but in fact , you have to take the whole of , of , of the group before you even question that . </s>
So look at the whole package , not just oil . Yeah , Hunter . If China had continued to grow economically at the rate that it was – and this recent collapse has affected China as well – by 2030 it would have wanted more oil than the world now lifts or probably can ever lift . Obviously , at that point the future is not possible . The International Energy Agency says , Expect serious constraints on the supply of oil within two years . </s>
The Germans think a year . Matt Simmons , the Houston oil banker , says we’ve already hit peak oil . And what has held it up , what held up the run-up in prices is the economic collapse . It really doesn’t matter . </s>
The investments that you would want to make if you were scared to death about peak oil are exactly the same investments you’d want to make if you simply want to make money , i.e. , energy efficiency , and then renewable energy . </s>
So I think peak oil falls into the same problem as climate change . Yeah , it’s worth doing something about it because we can make money that way . Bjorn Lomborg . </s>
Again , we need to get a sense of proportion . A lot of people are trying to sell you , Oh , we can move to renewables . We can do a lot of great things . Let’s just remember that the International Energy Agency , as you just mentioned , estimate that right now we use about half of one percent of our energy comes from real renewables like wind and solar and geo-thermal . </s>
If we don’t do anything by 2030 it’ll be up to one point seven percent . But if we really strive , if we really do everything that all those people , over here on this side wants us to do we might be able to – the International Energy Agency estimates – to squeeze it up to two point eight percent . </s>
I’m sorry , that’s just not gon na make a big difference in this world . And that’s , of course , the real crucial point . Neither are those numbers correct . Bjorn ... But the point is ... </s>
... we can meet , the U.S. National Energy Lab showed , by 2025 we could be meeting at least a quarter of U.S. energy through renewables if we simply made the intelligent investments . But there was a report in 1950 that said we could do it now . </s>
I mean , how can you keep on making these sorts of comparisons ? If you included nuclear in renewables the figures change . </s>
Hey , I like nuclear . I really do . </s>
There’s a lot of – Yes , you do . And a lot of environmentalists don’t . </s>
Remotely sited , ninety-three million miles away will do just fine . MAN Yeah . The only way Britain will make its is very , very simple , as all the governments have known – and Tony Blair knew extremely well – is that if we do not have a new generation of nuclear there’s absolutely no way we shall meet anything like a renewable target . </s>
This concludes round two of the debate . </s>
Thank you for all of your questions and thank you to our panel for quite seriously rising to the occasion . In a moment we’re going to do two things . Each panelist will have two minutes to make summary remarks . I will tell them if their time is up . </s>
When their time is up , if they run over , and right after that we will be polling you to determine the winner of this debate . And I want to remind you once again of the results we received when we polled you coming in off of the street . </s>
The motion is : That major reductions in carbon omissions are not worth the money . </s>
Coming in off the streets , in your response to that , sixteen percent of you were in support of that motion , forty-nine percent of you were against the motion and thirty-five percent of you were undecided . We’ll poll you again right after the closing remarks , which will be quite brief . And we’ll begin summing up against the motion . Oliver Tickell , journalist and author of the Kyoto2 climate initiative . </s>
Oliver Tickell . Someone asked the question , How far should we go ? </s>
And you know , at what point have we made sufficient cuts in greenhouse gas emissions ? And there is , in fact , quite a clear answer to that . What we’ve got ta do , Philip Stott is quite right when he says , We can’t stop climate change . What we’ve got ta do is to stop the runaway greenhouse effect in which positive feedback processes in the climate system lead to an inexorable extreme warming process , turning this planet into a very different place , a hothouse earth – one in which the limiting factor on humans isn’t so much whether we can survive the temperatures . It’s whether the climate system can survive these temperatures . </s>
It’s whether ice caps can survive these temperatures . And the bottom line actually came from Jim Hanson of NASA , of Columbia University , just up the road – and that is , three fifty parts per million . If we manage to have long term stabilization at three hundred and fifty parts per million of CO2 accompanied by major reductions in other greenhouse gases , we actually have a chance of preventing that runaway greenhouse effect . </s>
Now , I think it’s worth spending almost any amount of money to stop that from happening . The fantastic news is we don’t have to . Actually , the costs are really quite modest in the context of the global economy and they bring benefits , which are greater , considerably greater than what we spend . And it’s spread over a far wider area than simply economic benefits . They bring quality of life benefits , ecological benefits , benefits in food security , benefits in bio-diversity . </s>
And so to come back to the point of this – is it worth making these investments in order to bring about major cuts in carbon dioxide , in the emissions ? The answer is , yes , it is . And I’m very happy to know that this is actually on the verge of taking place here in the United States under the new President , Obama . </s>
Oliver Tickell , thank you very much . </s>
Making , making his summary remarks for the motion – Bjorn Lomborg , founder of the Copenhagen Consensus . </s>
Thank you . It’s a little depressing to see that I started out telling you that we were gon na hear two arguments . And indeed we have heard them . One is that this is gon na be the end of the world and therefore we need to do whatever Oliver says . I’m not really sure that’s such a great argument . </s>
I would simply say we know from the U.N . Climate Panel that global warming will cause problems but it will not by any means be the end of the world . It is one of the many problems we need to tackle and that’s exactly why we’re having this debate -- exactly asking , Is this worth the money or should we indeed do other things ? And that’s , of course , the other slightly sad thing , that it’s a false choice . We can do everything but we don’t . And so my question to you is really very , very simply , How do you want to be remembered ? </s>
Al Gore actually points this out very well . He says , This is our generational mission . He asks you , How do you want to be remembered by your kids and your grandkids ? I find it stunning that he would actually make that argument because the real question is , Do you want to be remembered for having spent hundreds of billions or even trillions of dollars to do virtually no good a hundred years from now ? Or do you want to be remembered for actually having solved all the major problems that half of this world’s population suffers -- these medieval , terrible tragedies that we are watching right now ? </s>
This is really about how you want to be remembered . </s>
And I hope you want to be remembered by doing a lot of good rather than just a little bit . That’s what tonight’s decision is about . </s>
That’s the tradeoff . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Bjorn Lomborg . Arguing , summing – and Adam , can you see the clock ? </s>
I just want to make sure that it’s obvious to you . </s>
Summing up against the motion , Adam Werbach , global CEO of Saatchi and Saatchi S . John Muir , the founder of the Sierra Club – he founded it in 1892 – said that when you pick anything up by itself you find it hitched to everything else in the universe . </s>
And that hitchedness is what I refuse to let go . </s>
Mr. Lomborg , others say it’s a choice , that we can either create green jobs , that we can launch a new Apollo project , that we can’t do that and deal with poverty , global poverty , at the same time . </s>
In fact , we have to . </s>
And when you ask the question , How do you want to be remembered ? – I don’t want to be remembered as a person who , to my three kids , as the one who saw a crisis facing us and who ignored it . We can do something about this . Mr. Stott says that , glibly , that people can live in the Sahara , they can live to , in Greenland . </s>
It makes it sound like you just need to put shorts on and that will deal with climate change . It is more serious than that . Mr. Huber describes himself as a technical utopian , but doesn’t want a system to regulate that technology in the end and to guarantee the marketplace for that . And that sounds to me quite familiar to marketing subprime loans but not having a strong enforcement mechanism , not having an SEC that could actually maintain the investment structures here in the United States . </s>
More reductions in carbon emissions are worth the money . And many of the anecdotes we shared tonight are examples of how they are worth the money . And the reason we used anecdotes is because we actually have examples of how it’s actually happening . </s>
Now , you can deny that . You can say those act ... those aren’t real , and those don’t add up . Or you can actually look at them . </s>
And there is a reason why the world’s largest company went to China and told its thousand largest suppliers that it will pay more money if it has to build better products . They want quality socks , not socks that fall down . </s>
And those quality socks probably have less energy in them as well . Major reductions in carbon are worth the money . We’re not going to do unintelligent things . We’re going to spend it right . </s>
Thank you , Adam Werbach . Reminding you that the motion is : Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money , and making his final summary for the motion – Peter Huber , author of The Bottomless Well and a columnist for Forbes . Well , and now I am done , I am going to get personal and nasty . </s>
And I’m going to talk to you over there , and you . Yeah , you know who you are – and also you . And like a medieval priest , you know , there are carbon brokers out there today who will sell you an indulgence that will forgive all your carbon sins . It will run you about five hundred dollars for five tons of carbon , which is about what the typical American needs – or about two thousand dollars per typical household . </s>
Your broker will spend the money on something good – most likely cleaning up hog farms in Brazil . But if you really want to make a difference , you must send a check large enough to forgive four Brazilian households , too , because they can’t afford that . So to cover all five households – the rich one and the four poor – make it four thousand dollars . And you probably forgot to send a check last year and who knows ? , some of you might even forget it for the next eight years . </s>
Let’s cover all the sins , you know , one backed , this year’s and eight in advance . You’ll feel so much better if you’ve already paid for these future sins . </s>
Let’s make it ten years , forty thousand dollars . Now , if you honestly believe that substantial reductions in carbon emissions are worth the money , you will , sadly , vote against the proposition . But then you must , you absolutely must , scurry right back home and send your check in because if you don’t you will have burdened your already sooty soul with an extra five tons of self- righteous hypocrisy . And you can’t possibly , you can’t possibly afford what it will take to forgive that . Your other -- Your other option , your other option is to keep your money in the pocket and vote for the proposition . </s>
However desperately you may wish it were false , vote for because it is , in fact , a true statement of engineering and economic and geo-political fact . And vote “for” because acknowledging reality is the essential first step in trying to change anything for the better . </s>
Thank you , Peter Huber . </s>
And with her two minutes to sum up , against the motion , Hunter Lovins , President and founder of Natural Capitalism Solutions . </s>
Boys , you’ve done a pretty good job of arguing what is essentially an untenable proposition . </s>
Why is it untenable ? Because the numbers are in . Goldman Sachs , July two years ago , showed that the companies that are leading the way in cutting their emissions , in implementing energy efficiency have twenty-five percent higher stock value than their competitors . The Economist Intelligence Unit , last February – the companies that are leading in this have the highest , fastest growing stock value and , conversely , the worst performing companies in the economy are most likely to have nobody in charge of these issues . Deutsche Asset Management , Dr. Bruce Kahn : This is a historic opportunity for the administration to take a global leadership position in energy while addressing the current economic and financial crisis . </s>
He calls for a green national infrastructure bank investing in energy efficiency and renewables . </s>
He said , Spend on the green sweet spot -- efficiency in buildings , the new electric grid , renewables and public tranist . He said , Credible scientific debate is over . </s>
As more dynamic models of climate change are developed , we expect to see estimates of the danger of global warming increasing . This is the business community , folks . This is simply a better way of doing business . Now , you hold in your hands the future . </s>
You can choose to vote for the finest thinking of the Twentieth Century or you can vote for the future . You can vote to unleash this new energy prosperity . It matters what you vote now . We have argued – and I think we’ve proven -- that cutting carbon is worth the money . </s>
We have not tried to argue that these investments will solve everything . </s>
We have also argued – I have – that these are the investments that will deliver genuine development to the rest of the world . So if you care about Bjorn’s position you will invest in these low carbon technologies . Thank you , Hunter Lovins . And finally , summing up for the motion , Philip Stott , Emeritus Professor and Bio- Geographer from the University of London . Adam quoted a very great American . </s>
I’d like also to relate to a northeastern great American – in fact , the very founder of the American ecological movement – George Perkins Marsh of Vermont , who wrote Men and Nature in 1864 , one of the greatest books ever written . </s>
And Professor David Lowenthal , also a great American author of the day , wrote something about him , which is extremely important for us to hear in the case of this debate . Environmental reformers who find nature’s inarticulate indifference unbearable impute their own aims to nature and then purport to speak on nature’s behalf . A rarified natural world is then worshiped as virtuous . And Marsh himself said , The equation of animal and vegetable life is too complicated a problem for human intelligence to solve . I think there was a mighty humility in Marsh’s view of nature , which actually we’ve forgotten today , which is vital . </s>
‘Cause what I am interested in is outcomes . Will it work ? Remember the motion is major cuts . </s>
I’m really serious about this . We agree on the influence that climate change will have impacts on people . Of course it will . </s>
But what is really in the end going to work ? It’s got to work . That’s why Peter’s realism is absolutely essential to all this . And back to Johnson to end . He said , Why , sir , most schemes of political improvement are very laughable things , he said – which I think is an important way of always looking at it . </s>
But finally , the limits of all that we’re doing here – also Johnson . How small of all that human hearts endure that part which laws or kings or senates or congresses – I’ve added those -- can cause or cure . In the end we want to solve this because we think it’s us . I’m afraid it’s nature , greater than us , and we can’t in the end manage it as we wish we would . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Philip Stott . And as their job is now done , I’d like to show some appreciation for our , our entire panel . And it’s clear , given , I would say , the unusual level of passion that we heard in this debate tonight , that these panelists very , very seriously are vying for your votes and want to win . </s>
And now comes the moment when you decide . I want to remind you that before the debate sixteen percent were for the motion that : Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money . Forty-nine were against , thirty-five percent were undecided . </s>
Please pick up your key pads . It’s time to vote again . If you support the motion , press number one . </s>
If you are against the motion , press number two . If you remain or became undecided , press number three . Does anybody need more time ? </s>
Everybody’s good ? Cause we’re gon na lock out the system . </s>
And we’ll have the results up to me in just a moment . In the meantime , I want to tell you while the vote is being tallied that our next debate will be back at the Caspary Auditorium at the Rockefeller University . </s>
That’s on the east side , if you don’t know . </s>
The motion to be debated on Tuesday , February 3rd , is this : The art market is less ethical than the stock market . </s>
Panelists for the motion are Richard Feigin , Michael Hugh Williams and Adam Lindemann . Against the motion we have Amy Cappellazzo , Chuck Close and Jerry Saltz . </s>
I hope that I’ll see many of you in a few weeks at the Caspary Auditorium . And how close are we to having the paper come up ? Do you know , Joe ? Bob ? Okay , it’s on its way . This can be a very brief talk amongst yourselves moment . </s>
And remember , the way that we measure victory in this is not where the room sits at the end but the dynamic of how the room moved . And so those undecided votes are critically important . </s>
Here we go . Well , it’s very interesting . Here are the final results from your poll on our motion that : Major reductions in carbon emissions are not worth the money . Before the debate sixteen percent of you were for the motion , forty-nine percent against and thirty-five percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , forty-two percent of you are for the motion , forty-eight percent are against and ten percent are undecided . The side for the motion has moved more people , changed more minds . Congratulations to them . And thank you , debaters . And to the Rosenkranz Foundation and to you for joining us , wherever you are watching in the world . </s>

> > END TAPE . < < </s>
null I’m Robert Rosenkranz , Chairman of Intelligence Squared . With me is Dana Wolfe , our Executive Producer , and it’s my pleasure to welcome you tonight . This is the final debate , the eighth debate of our inaugural season . We launched this debate series with the goal of raising the level of public discourse in this country , and I think we’re very gratified with the reception that we’ve received . </s>
I want to express my thanks to National Public Radio , through whose auspices tonight’s debate will heard in over sixty radio stations around the country , including most of the major ones . WNYC is producing the ra- , the radio broadcast . The format is a debate in which three panelists on each side try to persuade you to vote their way on a resolution . </s>
The resolution tonight is , “A booming China spells trouble for America.” Well , why did we pick this topic ? First of all , it seems clear that the emergence of China as an , as an economic superpower is perhaps the most dramatic economic event in our lifetime . Since China’s economic liberalization in 1978 , the average person in China is about twelve times better off . Pretty extraordinary for a single generation . </s>
With some 1.3 billion souls , China has orchestrated the biggest improvement in material well being in human history . Chinese imports provide about a thousand dollars in increased purchasing power for the average American family . It’s become the fastest growing market for U.S. exports , a very exciting , uh , set of investment opportunities for U.S. business . It’s offered the world a almost a “how to do it” manual for transitioning from a state controlled economy , uh , to an economy where the private sector is larger and the state sector smaller than virtually any developed country in the world , save the United States . </s>
So why tonight’s debate ? </s>
Where might the trouble lie for America ? Well , perhaps it’s in our two hundred and thirty billion dollar trade deficit . Perhaps it’s because a million eight hundred thousand American jobs have been lost . Perhaps it’s because China’s , uh , appetite for raw materials , natural resources has , uh , pushed it toward very close relationships with countries like Iran . With China’s military buildup , which was most recently , demonstrated by its ability to destroy an orbiting satellite . </s>
As in so much of America’s high- tech military resou- , relies on satellite communications for commanded control , this was a particularly strategic , provocation . Interestingly , this debate does not fall along traditional ideological lines . My , perhaps list , energizes the anti- Globalization left , as well as security hawks on the right . </s>
But which side can marshal the facts and analysis to support their view ? Well , we have an exceptionally strong panel this evening . Our moderator is British journalist James Harding , who since last year has been Business and City Editor of The Times of London , our media sponsor . And prior to this , James was with the , Financial Times , serving as Washington Bureau Chief , Media Editor , and prior thereto as correspondent in China , where he opened the Shanghai office , or Shanghai bureau , I should say . </s>
And it’s now my pleasure to pass the evening on to James . Thank you , Bob . </s>
Thank you very much , Bob . I’d like to welcome you all to the eighth Intelligence Squared debate here in the U.S. Let me give you a brief rundown of what we’re gon na do this evening . </s>
Um , first , the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument . The opposition will follow . And then each person will get a maximum of eight minutes , and we will go back and forth from one side to the other . Second , when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks , I will open up the floor to brief questions from the audience . Third , when the Q & A is complete , each debater will make a final statement lasting not more than two minutes per person . </s>
And fourth , after the closing statement is made , you’ll vote on tonight’s motion with the keypad that is attached to the armrest of your seat . Fifth and last , I will announce the results . </s>
Now , before hearing from our panelists , I’d like to start with a pre-debate vote . You’ll see that , on the armrest to your left , there is a keypad , uh , it looks like this . And for audience members sitting along the aisle , you’ll find it just to your right . Uh , sorry , the keypad is , , the way , it’s the one that I’m holding up here in my right hand , it should be on your right hand side , I apologize . </s>
I think you’ll find in the debate , there won’t be such confusion between left and right . </s>
Now , after my prompt , what I’d like you to do is press “one” for the motion , press “two” against the motion , and if you’re undecided press “three.” Please begin voting now . Apparently it is on the left , but I hope you’ve all got one , and as long as you’ve got one , you voted with it . known , and I will let you know the results of the vote later on this evening . Now , let me in- , introduce the panel to you . </s>
For the motion . Firstly , we have Bill Gertz , who’s the defense and national security reporter for the Washington Times , an author , and a uh , Fox News analyst . </s>
Then , we have Professor John Mearsheimer , the R. Wendell Harrison Distinguished Service Professor of Political Science , and the co-director of the program on international security policy at the University of Chicago . And finally , Michael Pillsbury , consultant to the office of the U.S. Secretary of Defense on future planning issues , and advisor to the Pentagon on Asian Affairs and long-term defense planning . Against the motion , there’s the founder and chairman and chief executive officer of the McGregor , of McGregor & Company , author , and the former chief executive of Dow Jones in China , James McGregor . Then we have Daniel H. Rosen , the principal of China Strategic Advisory , adjunct associate professor at Columbia University and visiting fellow with the Institute of International Economics . And Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy , managing director of Kissinger Associates and a three-time ambassador serving Singapore , the People’s Republic of China , and Indonesia . </s>
Right , those were the formalities , now let’s get on with the debate , starting with Bill Gertz , over to you . </s>
The question before the house is , “Is a booming China , does a booming China spell trouble for America ? ” The answer , in my view , is a resounding yes . In the next few minutes , I’m going to explain why . But first , what I call “the China threat , ” which is something that Beijing likes to refer to as “the China threat theory , ” is in fact real . Uh , it is a danger and it is growing . </s>
Um , as a , as the late CIA analyst and White House National Security Council official , Constantin Menges put it in his book China : The Gathering Threat , he said the reason that China poses a threat is because , despite its economic reforms , it is today ruled by a nuclear armed Communist dictatorship . This is the source of , of the trouble . </s>
I’ve identified what I call eleven sources of trouble for the United States from China , and I’m going to list them for you , and then talk briefly with the time remaining on , in some detail on it . The first is China’s military buildup . Number two is the danger of war over Taiwan . </s>
Number three is expansionism over energy resources . Number four is the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and missiles . </s>
Number five is massive intelligence operations to steal U.S. secrets and technology . Number six is influence operations and so-called money diplomacy . Number seven is unfair trade practices , including currency valuation manipulation . Number eight , intellectual property theft . </s>
Number nine , human rights abuses . </s>
Number ten , religious repression . </s>
And number eleven , environmental degradation and global warming . </s>
To start with , the most serious trouble for America from China is China’s military buildup . On January eleventh of this year , China conducted an unprecedented anti-satellite missile test . They fired a missile that traveled through space and hit a low Earth orbit satellite , a Chinese weather satellite , destroying it and creating , uh , sixteen thousand pieces of debris , which pose a threat to other satellites . </s>
U.S. official were shocked by this development because U.S. intelligence estimates of China’s military have been stating for years that China is ten , fifteen , maybe twenty years behind the United States . That it is so far behind that there is no way China’s military could pose a threat . What the Chinese ASAT test showed was that China is not seeking to follow the U.S. missile for missile , ship for ship , submarine for submarine . They’re going after niche weapons , they’re trying to leap ahead with special technology , and they’re doing this in a number of key areas , one of which is anti-satellite weapons . </s>
Officials in Washington estimate that by , within the next , uh , six years , China will have the capability of destroying all U.S. low Earth orbit satellites . Basically , this could be the modern day equivalent of a space Pearl Harbor against the United States if there were a conflict over Taiwan . Regarding Taiwan , the danger of war over the Taiwan Strait continues . China has not renounced the , its plan to use force to retake the island . </s>
It is applying pressure , across the board , uh , to pressure this democracy . It is succeeding in many ways to influencing U.S. policy in ways that would diminish support for this traditional ally . The danger of China expanding to gain resources is kind of a new , uh , source of trouble that has been identified by some studies in the Pentagon one of which was called the so-called “string of pearls strategy.” </s>
It shows that China , uh , is developing a string of pearls , bases , alliances along a path going from the Middle East , where all of its , much of its oil comes from , all the way to China . There are very much concerns that because energy is so , uh , integral to China’s modernization effort , that China at some point will have to expand militarily , perhaps the Russian Far East , perhaps Southeast Asia , uh , to take over , uh , places that have , uh , valuable oil and gas resources . Intelligence operations . Uh , this is a subject that I have focused on in my recent book . </s>
It also , uh , highlights the case of Chi Mak , who was a Chinese intelligence agent , recently convicted in California of uh , of being an unregistered agent of the Chinese government . It’s part of a , a mushrooming spy case , more of which will be coming out in , in the coming weeks and months , uh , which shows that China has been very successful in stealing some of the most advanced U.S. weapons technology , including the next generation quiet electric drive for our war ships , uh , secrets about our submarine force , and as well as the AEGIS battle management system , which is the heart of the , the modern Navy . As for influence operations , this is another area where China has been extremely successful in influencing policies , uh , against the United States . </s>
We see this through so- called , what one Chinese defector called “money diplomacy , ” uh , buying up former U.S. officials , and using those officials to lobby against policies that China doesn’t like . </s>
Uh , this is having a , a deleterious effect on the U.S. economy and U.S. policy because it’s preventing the United States from truly understanding the directions and goals of China’s military modernization and its , uh , its general modernization as well . Representative Randy Forbes , the chairman of the China caucus in the House of Representatives estimates that China spends upwards of one hundred million dollars annually , uh , on these influence operations . Unfair trade practices and currency issues , as well as , uh , uh , intellectual property theft . </s>
These issues are fairly well known , but I would like to highlight one issue surrounding the whole trade question . </s>
The main policy for the United States towards China has been to trade with China as a way to seek a liberalized Chinese government and political system . Unfortunately , the idea of trading with China as a liberal , a liberalizing factor is not working . In fact , just the other , just the opposite is happening . Uh , many feel that China’s buildup , its military buildup is being benefited by its economic growth , but yet we have seen little or no political reform in China . This is a , a very serious source of trouble for the United States . </s>
On human rights abuses , I would also point out how , at its core , China has never fully resolved that the Tiananmen massacre in 1989 , when pro-democracy protesters… </s>
One minute . …occupied the square . </s>
Um , as well , religious re- , repression is also in this field , as well as environmental degradation . </s>
Uh , as many as seven out of ten Chinese major rivers are now dead . </s>
This debate has often been couched as , as between engagement and contained , but really , the , the issue here is that what China needs is Democracy , and that is really the , the solution to mitigating these sources of trouble for the United States . Bill Gertz , many thanks indeed . </s>
A model of timeliness . Now to , um , stand against the motion “Beware the Dragon : A booming China spells trouble for America , ” I call upon Stapleton Roy . Good evening . Let me begin with a dangerous confession . I love Fu Manchu novels . </s>
I have read them all , I have seem every movie version that I can get my hand on . Nothing sends shudders up my spine so much as contemplating sinister Chinese scheming to control the world . </s>
So when I was confronted with the question of whether a booming China spells trouble for the United States , my natural instinct was to think of Fu Man Chu , and to give a resounding yes . But then I remembered that I had majored in History in college , not in the world’s great literature . </s>
When you look at what’s happening in China in terms of history and not in terms of fantasy fiction , you are forced to a very different conclusion . I grew up in wartime China , I was in China as a high school student at the time of the Communist revolution in 1949 , I visited China three times during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution . When I visit China now , the situation is so different and so much better than China was in those days . </s>
Nevertheless , the question before you is a serious one . Any country of 1.3 billion people can spell trouble for us or for the global system . I have dealt with China professionally for over thirty years , it has been troublesome throughout that period , our relations have improved , we have done well . </s>
But this is true that China can cause trouble , whether it’s in boom or bust . A China that is floundering with a sense of grievance against the world and disaffected with the international system would be a greater danger than a booming China that can feed and clothe its people , educate them domestically and abroad , buy vast amounts of U.S. goods and services , and benefit from the international system . That’s a far preferable outcome . Can we handle China’s troublesome aspects ? Of course we can . </s>
We’re the world’ premiere military power . We have the most large , we have the largest and most productive economy in the world . We’re improving our military technology at a rate faster than China is . We have the world’s , I mentioned the economy , we’re a global leader in science and technology , our schools and graduate schools are the envy of the world . </s>
The one requirement for handling any trouble that China causes is that we manage our domestic and international affairs so that we don’t squander the enormous advantages that we have . Remember , trouble for us spells even bigger trouble for China . </s>
The advantage is on our side , not China’s . Seven successive U.S. presidents over a space of thirty-five years have discovered that contain- , that containing troubles and developing common interests with China benefits us . Three successive generations of Chinese leaders have come to the same conclusion . </s>
Such a track record should give us confidence . What’s more , experience over the last fifteen years of China’s rapid growth shows clearly that a booming China offers enormous opportunities for the United States , and holds out the prospect of positive change in the future . China’s rapid growth has created an enormous middle class , concentrated in China’s coastal provinces . </s>
This new middle class enjoys a level of affluence unthinkable in the 1970’s . These middle class Chinese are educated , entrepreneurial , and outward looking . They have more in common with the middle classes elsewhere in Asia than they have with the on- , the backward parts of their own country . </s>
They represent the building blocks for China’s eventual transition to a more representative form of government . China’s society is remarkably more open than it was before . </s>
Hundreds of thousands of China’s best and brightest have been sent to the west , and primarily to the United States to study , the work , and the spend years here . Western educated Chinese now occupy significant positions at all levels of government , business , and education in China . Totally absent thirty years ago . In essence , China has abandoned Marxism and Leninism and class struggle in favor of Marxism eco- , uh , market economics , and promotion of a harmonious society . Obviously , as China’s economy continues to grow , and as its military capabilities improve , we have to consider the possibility that a more powerful and prosperous China will become a security threat . </s>
A highly nationalistic China under poor leaders or under bad leaders would pose serious problems for us and for the global community . Two aspects are of particular concern . China’s military spending has been growing at double digit rates for the last fifteen years , China’s defense forces are preparing for Taiwan scenarios , that include the possibility of U.S. intervention . Does this mean we should sound the alarms , and assume that conflict with China is inevitable over Taiwan ? The answer is no . </s>
The situation calls for vigi- , vigilance , not for alarm . U.S. military leaders are not sitting on their thumbs . They’re constantly improving our force posture , they’re pointedly confident that we can handle any challenges and they believe that conflict can be avoided . Such confidence is warranted . We in China have developed an effective framework from ma- managing the Taiwan issue . </s>
Both countries , the United States and China have stated that they are opposed to unilateral changes in the status quo with respect to Taiwan . In addition , enormous common interests have developed on both sides of the Taiwan Strait , interests missing , before we befriended China . Taiwan has brought over a hundred billion dollars of investment into the mainland . </s>
Millions of Taiwanese visit the mainland . Taiwan exports more across the Taiwan Straits now than it does to the United States . In the meantime , Taiwan runs its own affairs , it elects its own presidents , and it benefits from membership in the World Trade Organization and in the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum . In per capita GDP terms , Taiwan ranks just behind the European Union and ahead of countries such as Spain , New Zealand , and South Korea . It would require ineptitude on a massive scale in Beijing , Washington , and Taipei for this situation to generate into a military conflict . </s>
To conclude , an alarmist view of China exaggerates the dangers and obscures the opportunities . One minute . China’s economy is now ten times larger than it was in 1978 and our relations with China are better . </s>
And China has significant defense liabilities . Its most modern , advanced military equipment comes from Russia , an unreliable source . </s>
After years of rapid growth , China now in defense spending , China now spends approximately the same percentage of GDP that we do , but its GDP is much smaller than ours . </s>
Its , its defense budget is less than half of the combined defense budgets of the UK , France , Germany , and Italy , all part of the European Union with a common defense policy . My experience in Asia has made me an optimist . I lived in Taiwan under an authoritarian regime . It’s now a thriving democracy . </s>
I lived in Thailand twice under military-dominated governments , only to see it move to , for a period uh , to thriving parliamentary democracy . I was in Indonesia when an authoritative – Stapleton Roy , I 'm afraid I’m going to have to stop you there . Gave way . To sum up , the troubles produced by China booming are manageable , the opportunities are encouraging , the outlook is hopeful if we display the traditional qualities that made us a great country – </s>
And the speech is coming to a close . Dragons are mythological – Thank you very much . This debate will be retitled “Beware the Moderator.” Um , we now turn to Michael Pillsbury who is going to speak for the motion . </s>
Thank you very much . As all of you know , here in sophisticated New York , State Department and Defense Department often don’t get along . So it may come as a surprise to you – it certainly comes to a surprise to me – that I agree with every word of what Stapleton Roy just said . In fact , I believe our team wants to adopt him as a fourth member of our team , because he essentially is speaking in favor of the motion uh , as we see it . </s>
And I want to ask for your support for the motion in the way we define the two key words in the motion . The first word is “beware.” And we take that to mean be wary , be wary . The second key word , Bill Gertz went over eleven examples , is “trouble , ” “spells trouble.” In other words , the burden on the other team to earn your vote is to say you should not beware , you should be blithely sort of confident that there will be no problems at all with China . </s>
They have to sustain that case . Then they have to sustain the case that there will be no trouble from China , forever . It seems to me it should be unanimous tonight that our team is going to win , especially since Stapleton Roy essentially is working for us . I do want to say he characterized the Defense Department’s view of China quite correctly , that’s very accurate . </s>
Uh , going back for fifteen years now , Secretaries of Defense and chairmen of the Joint Chiefs have said over and over and over that China is not a threat to the United States . In fact , often they embellish and say China , for the foreseeable future , will not be a threat . So that’s the public position of the Pentagon . It’s not looking for a war , there’s a very high level of confidence uh , that we will prevail in any conflict with China . Um and what you actually get is a series of factual reports each year that come out that list the eleven examples of trouble that Bill Gertz gave as factual matters . </s>
But Mr. Roy , Ambassador Roy is correct that there’s a sense of confidence and not seeking any sort of conflict from China in the Pentagon . There’s a sense of , that China is not a threat . </s>
And frankly , I have , since we’re telling autobiographical stories , I have had about thirty-five years meeting with Chinese generals uh , from the first meet up here in the United Nations not far from here all the way to last week when the Delegation of Generals was hosted by us in the Pentagon . Enormous changes have taken place but not necessarily for the , for the better . If you go back all the way to the beginning of the U.S. Military relationship with the Chinese Communists , it’s really 1944 that we began to do some intelligence cooperation against the Japanese in the middle of World War II . </s>
That came out of something called the Dixie Mission that some of you , I think in the audience , look like you remember it . But six years later , six years later we’re at war with China . Tragic , tragic war where the Chinese to this day claimed they warned us . They used this strange phrase about “we wo n't put our hands in our sleeves” and that was supposed to mean we’re going to send three hundred thousand troops in and destroy American forces . We didn’t understand it that way . </s>
And a tragic , avoidable war took place . </s>
Twenty years of containment passed , another cycle began of military cooperation between the U.S. and China . Uh , our generals and theirs have met hundreds of times . We in the eighties , under President Reagan , who certainly would yield to nobody in his anti-Communism , President Reagan authorized the sale of six American sophisticated weapon systems to China . </s>
Again a peak , by the end of 1944 when we were cooperating closely with the Chinese . </s>
You almost could n't have had more security cooperation than we did under President Reagan with China . Three years later , 1989 , it had to all be canceled and not far from here out in Bethpage , Long Island , two Chinese jet fighters sort of MiG23 jet fighters had to be crated up and sent back to China . And we refunded part of their money because of the Tiananmen incident and the heart wrenching effect it had on American hopes for democracy and human rights in China . </s>
Then in the last fifteen or sixteen years , there have been ups and downs as Stapleton Roy correctly pointed out . But we’ve never gotten a pledge from China not to use force against Taiwan . We’ve never settled , we’ve never really gotten credit for what Henry Kissinger did . </s>
Uh , President Nixon withdrew American nuclear weapons from Taiwan . President Nixon severed the military connection . President Carter severed the fact that we kept two American generals there , one for arms supply , one to plan war with the Defense of Taiwan in mind . The Chinese take that , those major concessions from us as though they never happened . And the Chinese rhetoric today continues to talk about how the U.S. , if it even sells one bullet to Taiwan , this somehow strengthens the independence forces on Taiwan . </s>
It’s simply not true . We have enormous self-imposed restrictions on our arms sales to Taiwan . So across the board , we have a lack of progress in Chinese nationalistic attitudes toward America . If you pull out an average Chinese Youth Daily article today and you look up what does it say about the United States , it’s not very friendly . </s>
We have fifteen major programs now in foreign aid , in helping their banking system through our Treasury Department . </s>
Our Labor Department has a mediation service , going to help them with labor disputes . </s>
Every department of the U.S. government has what , in my view amounts to an aid program , a program of engagement with China . Very seldom mentioned in the Chinese press . If you 're a young Chinese , you have the impression that America is trying to dismember China , that America poses a military threat , that America’s working with India and Japan to somehow crush China or contain its rise . All of this nationalistic rhetoric ought to be banned in the Chinese press . </s>
We don’t say these things in our press , but it hasn’t stopped the worst was 1999 , I might point out , when the front page of the Communist Party Daily , People’s Daily , carried a long article called “The Seven Ways America is Worse than Nazi Germany.” </s>
And it went into detail about which kind of gas the Nazis had used in their camps , and then there was a paragraph , I’ll never forget it , saying the Americans are even worse than that . One minute . So to support our side of this debate , you have to be wary , that is look for possibilities that might happen in the future where things may not be as rosy as we may have hoped . </s>
And you have to admit there’s trouble . That’s , that’s all we , we ask for our side . And I hope it will be unanimous , but we don’t , we don’t have to be , our side doesn’t have to be extreme . We don’t have to be alarmist about China , we don’t have to forecast an inevitable war . </s>
We don’t have to say that we should break off all relations . </s>
I mention to you the fifteen aid programs , I want to close my last sentence with just one of the most impressive , to me , we have more than fifty agreements , governmental agreements to transfer American scientific findings to China for free . Our National Science Foundation , our White House Office of Science and Technology Policy are in charge of this—Chinese don’t really make a big deal out of it , but it’s an amazing program… Michael Pillsbury , I 'm afraid your time is up . </s>
Thank you . Thank you very much . We now turn to Daniel Rosen who is speaking against the motion . </s>
Thank you very much James and uh , it’s a pleasure to be here this evening . I want to start by saying welcome to New York uh , to those supporting tonight’s proposition . While neo-cons and liberals alike uh , down in the Beltway in Washington and from other places around the country debate the theory and these concepts of grand strategy to do with China , we here in New York have been working very , very hard of course in our many professions to try to understand the nature of its reform , its growth , and make sure that we benefit as a nation from what’s the epic changes taking place in this country , making sure that we don’t gauge China against the uh , abject failures of thirty , forty , fifty years ago , some of which have already been cited . But instead , recognize that China is not at all standing still uh , and is very much a work in progress . </s>
So I for one , very much look forward to the chance to debate these issues here tonight , the notion that China’s strengthening is bad news for us , which is really what we’re talking about of course . China’s boom is essentially economic at its core . So the role that uh , has been cast for me is to lay out three critical economic arguments uh , for why , whether you 're a New Yorker or not , uh , you should be very much against the motion that we have on the table before us this evening . </s>
First argument , China’s boom is benefiting others in a big way , not just China . </s>
Secondly , that its growth is very much helping its people , not repressing them , and thus mitigating , in an important way , many threats that we’d have to deal with if China were not growing . And thirdly , that we the United States together with China , have larger economic responsibilities of a global nature that demand our mutual respect and our enthusiasm , in fact , instead of confrontation with China over its growth and strengthening . Which indeed is what uh , is what we’re , we’re here to debate . </s>
Let me exch- , uh , explain each of these very briefly . First of all , China’s growth is benefiting the economies of rich and poor nations alike . </s>
Japan , with merely forty percent of the labor force that the United States has , exports ten billion dollars worth of goods to China every month . </s>
The United States only exports half that amount . Germany , with a mere one-quarter of our labor force , has run a net trade surplus with China over the period 1992 to today . The point of this is China is not an economy that is closed to rich-world exports at all . </s>
It’s very much open to them . Developing nations , in Southeast Asia , in Latin America , in Africa , are also benefiting in a way the World Bank could n't have imagined a few years ago from China’s dynamic growth . It’s embracing China as a new destination for exports . </s>
Even Taiwan , that’s of such concern to us all here at this table , is in fact enjoying a sixty-six billion dollar a year trade surplus with its archenemy uh , the People’s Republic of China , a trade surplus which has grown from fourteen to forty percent every year of this decade so far . Taiwan in fact is moving away from the attitude behind the motion on the table this evening , away from confrontation and toward a working out of things in a peaceful manner , a deepening and integrating its economy with the mainland’s . Bottom line : our fortunes here depend on what we do , on how we compete with China , not on what China does . </s>
We should spend more time competing with Germany and Japan , in fact , for the Chinese market , and less time blaming China for all of our troubles . </s>
Of course the United States is already a major beneficiary of China’s economic activity . If we cut off all trade with China tomorrow , we would create very few American jobs , we would import practically everything we import from China , but from other countries at a higher price , which would n't really benefit anybody in this country . Second major argument I want to make : China’s growth benefits its people and by doing so , mitigates profound troubles that would eventuate , if that were not the case . </s>
The real threats , the existential threat , threats to the United States today come from impoverished and stagnant states writhen by discontent and insecurity . </s>
North Korea , Iran , Iraq , the Middle East in general , stagnant economic situations in Sudan , in Venezuela , these are what , these are the engines that breed terrorism and nihilism which are the true threat and trouble we should be concerning ourselves with . China could have been among those . In fact the China of 1978 , before the dreaded boom that we’re here to debate this evening , would have been one of those , by embracing our economic model in fact , which is what they’ve done , they’ve grown beyond that danger . And though eight hundred million Chinese are still poor by our standards , they’re striving toward prosperity and not toward extremism . </s>
Those people , those toiling Chinese are the boom that we’re here to pass judgment on this evening . </s>
And while their toil brings competitive challenges for us , we would be gravely mistaken to try to turn back the clock to the failed state China was before this boom began . Prosperity is not an alternative to political change in China . In fact , it’s been the handmaiden of it . </s>
The totalitarian government ruling two hundred dollar per capita China in 1978 bears practically no resemblance to the Chinese government managing a two thousand dollar per capita economy today . Likewise , the Chinese government that runs ten thousand dollar per capita China tomorrow will be vastly different than the one we deal with today . Third major argument : beyond our narrow economic interests – and theirs – lie global economic responsibilities that must be addressed cooperatively . Tonight we’re debating whether the benefits of a stronger China are worth the trouble it brings us along the way , or rather , whether the troubles of a stagnant China would suit our interests better , because that’s really the question . </s>
It’s which set of troubles suits the American interest and which does not ? It’s a reasonable question , but such a narrow-minded calculus of self-interest alone does not befit a great power and certainly does not befit the United States . Economic success , foremost ours and now China’s as well , is creating a great economic , political , and indeed security challenge , climate change and an environmental crisis globally . </s>
The U.S. has refused to address its responsibility to carbon , on carbon emissions . And the reason given : China . A con- convenient fits-all-purposes ex-excuse not to act when you don’t want to act . China , interestingly enough , has refused to exact uh , except carbon commitments for the same reason . One minute . </s>
The United States should go first . This log jam is fueled by the mistrust that tonight’s motion puts forward , and indeed it can not be permitted to stand . We have an economic responsibility to the planet to deal with this together or we’re going to lose more than anybody does . </s>
To finish , let me say this , I have a private practice in addition to being a think tanker and professor . And my customers are troubles . They’re troubles I’d like to have more of , frankly . I do n't have a problem with troubles , we have more troubles with Canada economically than we do with any other country . Is that bad news for the United States ? </s>
It’s not , it’s part of a mature relationship . </s>
Those in favor of tonight’s motion counsel a strategy meant to leave China in ruins using a play book last used in the Cold War , building up our military instead of our economy . Who will join us in such a strategy ? I urge you to vote against tonight’s motion . The troubles of a stagnant , unbooming China – </s>
Daniel Rosen , your time is up . Far , far outweigh – Your time is up . The challenges of its growth . Thank you . </s>
Thank you . Now I turn to John Mearsheimer , the last speaker uh , for the motion , “Beware the Dragon : A booming China spells trouble for America.” </s>
The question on the table is does a rising China spell trouble for the United States . </s>
Or in slightly different words from an American perspective , is a powerful China likely to be bad for the United States ? I think the answer is axiomatically yes . And I say this not because I feel any personal hostility towards the Chinese , which I certainly don’t , or because I think China is particularly aggressive because it was or is a Communist country or it is run in an authoritarian political form . </s>
I think that matters very little and I do n't say it because I think China’s likely to behave irrationally in the future . My argument is that the best situation for the United States from the perspective of maximizing its security is to be the most powerful state in the international system . The bigger the gap between you and everybody else , the more secure you are . </s>
To put it in Pentagonese , you don’t want a peer competitor in your national system . To give you two examples that highlight this point , think about the United States and its two immediate neighbors , Canada and Mexico . As you know , we are much more powerful than either one of those countries . None of you go to bed at night worrying about Canada or Mexico attacking the United States tomorrow , next week , or next year . That’s simply not going to happen because we’re so powerful . </s>
Would you trade the present situation for one where Canada and Mexico or Canada or Mexico was twice as powerful as the United States ? Of course you would n't , it’s much better to have a situation where we’re the most powerful state in the Western hemisphere . Same basic logic applies to China . If China has two choices , one it can have a Japan in Asia that’s five times more powerful than China , or a situation where China is five more , five times more powerful than Japan . Which one of those alternatives do you think the Chinese will choose ? </s>
It’s an open-and-shut case . </s>
They’d much prefer to be five times more powerful . And the same basic argument applies to the United States and China . </s>
Today , tomorrow , or at any point in time . If you have a choice of being as powerful or less powerful than China , or being more powerful , which would you choose if you 're interested in maximizing your security ? </s>
An open and shut case . Let me spell out the logic that underpins my argument . Principal goal of any state in the international system , it’s not the only goal , but the principal goal is survival . And the reason is , if you don’t survive , you can’t pursue any other goals . </s>
The problem that states have is they operate in an anarchic system . That’s political science speak for saying that they operate in a system where there’s no higher authority that you can turn to if you get into trouble . </s>
international politics , there’s nobody at the other end . In a system like that , where you 're dealing with other states whose intentions you can never be certain of , and you want to understand here that it’s impossible for the United States to discern what Chinese intentions will be ten years from now , twenty years from now , thirty years from now . We don’t know what those intentions will be . In a system where you can’t discern intentions , and where there is no higher authority that you can turn to when you 're in trouble , the best way to maximize your chances of surviving is to make sure that you are by far the most powerful sys- , state in the international system . To put it in colloquial terms , you want to be the biggest and baddest dude on the block , so that nobody fools around with you . </s>
To put it in political science speak , you want to be a hegemony . Now the question is , what does the system look like today ? Situation today from an American point of view is ideal . </s>
We’re by far the most powerful state on earth . We dominate the Western hemisphere . There’s no state in our uh , region of the world that could possibly challenge us . We have tremendous power projection capabilities , which is why we’re called the only superpower in the world . And in Asia and in Europe , the two areas of the world where there are other great powers or potential great powers , we have no peer competitor . </s>
There’s no imperial Japan , there’s no imperial Germany , there’s no Nazi Germany , and there’s no Soviet Union . From an American point of view , that’s a wonderful situation . Now , what is the future going to look like if in say , twenty years , China continues to grow economically the way it has grown over the last twenty years ? What you 're going to get is a country that’s economically pretty close to being as strong as the United States , and you could rest assured that China’s going to turn that economic might into military might . They’d be foolish if they didn’t . </s>
You’ll then have a country that’s roughly uh , the military equivalent of the United States , or at least close to it . That country is going to try to dominate Asia the way the United States has successfully dominated the western hemisphere . They’d be fools to do otherwise . Do you think the founding fathers and their successors in this country were fools because they had attempted to establish , and did establish a Germany in the Western hemisphere ? </s>
Of course not . </s>
They did it for good security reasons . </s>
The Asians will do the same , the Chinese will do the same thing in Asia . We have a Monroe Doctrine here in the United States . Most of you know it very well . We basically tell the European and Asian great powers that they have to stay out of our hemisphere . </s>
We don’t want them here . Don’t you think the Chinese are going to feel the same way in Asia when they’re powerful enough to think about dominating Asia ? </s>
Furthermore , they’re going to dominate , develop significant power projection capability just like we have developed power projection capability . They’re going to develop a blue water navy and that navy is going to be designed to go into the Middle East , much the way our navy is designed to go in the Middle East . </s>
When I was a young boy , my mother used to say what’s good for the goose is good for the gander . If it’s good for the United States , why don’t you think it’ll be good for China to try and dominate Asia and to try and develop significant power projection capability ? Of course this all raises the question then , how is the United States likely to react ? </s>
It’s very simple . We have a clear record here of how we’ll react when other countries try to dominate either Europe or Asia . We go to great lengths to stop them . Imperial Germany , imperial Japan , Nazi Germany , and the former Soviet Union , they’re all on the scrap heap of history . </s>
And we played a key role in putting them there . The United States will not tolerate a situation where China tries to dominate Asia . And as I said , China will try to dominate Asia just the way the United States has tried to dominate and has succeeded at dominating the Western hemisphere . What is my bottom line here ? </s>
My bottom line is straightforward . The present situation is better for the United States and more stable than a world – One minute . In which China is as powerful or almost as powerful as the United States . </s>
In other words , if China rises , trouble is in store for the United States . </s>
Thank you . John Mearsheimer , thank you very much . And now finally , Jim McGregor speaking against the motion . Well I , my name is Jim McGregor and I’ve lived in China for twenty years . </s>
And I 'm just grateful that I did not make Bill Gertz’s list of eleven threats from China . Um it’s kind of intimidating being here among all these Ph.D.s and well studied men . I ended up in China because I was expelled from high school . </s>
Um , I joined the army when I got expelled from high school , they sent me to Vietnam , that turned my head towards Asia , led to me becoming a journalist . And as time went on , I wanted to get back to Asia as a journalist , so I went to China in ’85 and backpacked through the country . Um , ’87 , I moved to Taiwan to learn Mandarin and I’ve lived in Beijing since ’90 , both as a journalist and a businessperson . </s>
All of the theories that I’ve heard tonight , I’ve read many times . My view is more kind of grass roots what China looks like on the ground and what I’ve seen . </s>
Um , when I first moved to China as a reporter , I had secret police following , my phone was tapped . </s>
Even the maid who took care of our nanny who helped us with our daughter was from the foreign ministry and made reports on us . Um and this was a country that was just really emerging from the forest fire of the Cultural Revolution . And what I’ve seen since then has been kind of documented by other speakers here tonight on the fast growth . I’ve watched , the first uh , financial person I met in China was a guy named Milen Xiong who was a , a steel worker who had cornered the market on the four stocks on the illegal Shanghai stock market . </s>
Um and now China’s um , doing the world’s largest IPOs and in fact Chinese stocks were the top performers on NASDAQ last year . When I first got to Beijing in the fall , you had big piles of cabbage on the corner because that was the only vegetable they got . People would bring it home , they’d shove it under their bed or in their cabinets and over the winter , you’d tear away the rotten leaves and you could eat the fresh leaves inside . Well as you know , now , if I don’t see a new high rise everyday , I get a little jittery , it’s moving so fast . </s>
Um international sophistication , when I went there in ’85 , people would come up to me on the street and show me around for the day because they were so excited to learn about the outside world . While we’ve had six hundred thousand students alone from China come to the United States , Chinese people are very international , traveling the world , doing business um , and even being involved in uh , academic uh , endeavors in the United States . So we’ve learned that China’s a very formidable country tonight and we better be scared of them um , because why ? Well China has grown very fast and it’s moving very fast , but what has happened during this period ? China has been shoving all kinds of problems under the carpet . </s>
The carpet’s getting lumpy and the country will trip on these problems and it’s going to be very busy for the new few decades fixing this . Environment , China is trash . Sixteen of the twenty worst air-polluted cities in the world are in China . </s>
I’ve traveled every province of China and I’ve never seen a clean body of water that was not in a bottle . Um , healthcare , from a fairly decent healthcare system has become very commercial . </s>
Two-thirds of people don’t have healthcare . If you 're a peasant and your kid gets cancer , what do you do ? You beg , borrow , and steal money to get them to a hospital in a city . </s>
Uh , you have to deposit the money for your kid to be in that hospital . If you run out of money , they kick your kid out of that hospital . Um the have and the have-not issue is growing and growing . There was eighty thousand demonstrations two years ago . Last year they went down because they realized they better not be reporting on how many they had . </s>
Um and on and on party corruption , etcetera . So this is this uh , colossus that’s going to take on the United States . What does China really want ? </s>
From a military standpoint , China wants to protect its wealth . It’s been a country that’s been colonized . It also wants to have the military projection to be able to protect it , protect its own sea lanes . </s>
Um from natural resources , China , the rocks have not been kind to China . </s>
They’re as dependent as we are or more on imported oil and other mat- , in iron ore and other raw materials . Um the government . The government is running scared of its own people . You’ve got to realize when you have ten , ten , ten percent economic growth for twenty years and kids are growing up under that kind of growth , they expect exponential improvement every year forever . And the government has really no credibility other than economic growth and giving people a better life . </s>
So where does the United States have to worry ? Where do we really eclipse China ? You can’t be a global leader without a leading ideology and China right now has no leading ideology other than getting rich . Uh , right now the United States isn’t so popular around the world uh , with Iraq and other issues . </s>
China is out working the world , but I’ll tell you , people are looking for U.S. leadership . We will not have trouble competing with China diplomatically . </s>
Financial world . </s>
New York um , you can walk down the street here and throw a rock in any direction , you 're going to hit a trillion dollars in hedge funds . </s>
Um the Shanghai Bank still don’t have check-clearing mechanisms for private accounts . China’s moving ahead in , in the financial world . They’ve got a trillion dollar foreign exchange surplus and they’re in fact putting together a hundred twenty billion dollar hedge fund . But they are going to have to dependent on the U.S. and our financial system and cooperating with us for their money to be deployed well as well as the capital they need . </s>
Education . China’s built seven hundred universities in the last fifteen years . However , it still has stuffed ducks-style education where people are taught to memorize , not to think for themselves and not to analyze . The world , the world comes to America as long as we give them the visas to have the best in the world education system . We can absorb the brains of the world and stay ahead of anybody in the world . </s>
Um finally , I 'm looking at my opponents here . </s>
I 'm on the good guys team here on the left and uh , my opponents here , these are all learned men , they’re all PhDs . But take a look , there’s not a bit of suntan on any of those heads . Um they have , they have been sitting in offices in Washington and Chicago um , reading reports and putting together the world under , under theories . And that’s quite good , I 'm happy to say that . </s>
And I 'm not here , I 'm not here to defend China . I 'm here to defend America because um , if you say that we can’t handle the rise of China um , then you 're voting against America tonight . I believe that you really have to vote no because if you vote yes , then you 're voting against America . America can handle the rise of China . </s>
China’s got a lot of problems . And we’re going to , we’ve , we’ve handled many things in , in the life of this country . And we will handle this quite well . </s>
Thank you very much . Jim McGregor , thank you very much . Now uh , before we turn to the uh , Q & A uh , part of the evening , I just wanted to let you know how you all voted um , before the uh , debate began . Um , before the debate , and I’ll just remind you , the motion is , “Beware the Dragon : A booming China spells trouble for America.” </s>
Before the debate began , you voted 41.05 percent of you , 41 percent of you voted for the motion , 37.4 percent voted against the motion , and 21.5 percent said you were undecided . So quite a thin margin for the sun-drenched team against the motion to sway them . Before we get started , I thought I’d abuse my position as a moderator here to just ask a couple of questions . And I guess I uh , wanted to start by um , directing a question at John Mearsheimer . Um you could n't help but feel , feel that Michael Pillsbury gave the game away a little bit when he said , you know , on our side of the motion , we don’t need to be alarmist , we don’t need to talk about war . </s>
And yet , within a few minutes’ time , you were saying , the U.S. will not tolerate a situation where China tries to dominate Asia . </s>
And I guess my question is , to you , how does China have a hope of fulfilling its promise of a peaceful rise if people like you are standing up and saying we will not tolerate China that seeks to dominate the region in which it lives ? </s>
Is this not just warmongering that is dressed as prudence ? </s>
And uh , I have a question I uh , also – . I , I have a question uh , out to Stapleton Roy um , which is listening to you , you can’t help but fear that , that your position is , is don’t worry be happy . </s>
Uh , we have a politically unstable superpower with a foreign policy that is unclear even to itself . And clearly that is going to , at the very least , threaten U.S. preeminence in the world . And I guess my question to you is looking back over the last thirty years , even if you take into account the benefits of engagement , has not commercial engagement with China made it more difficult for the U.S. to engage on issues from Tibet to Taiwan ? </s>
And how much will the U.S. be forced to compromise its foreign policy positions in , if it’s going to ignore the threat that China poses ? So first to address , Mearsheimer . Uh , the question of whether or not China can rise peacefully is a somewhat different question than the one that is on the table , and there’s no question , as our moderator said , that I’ve bumped into the question of whether China can rise peacefully . </s>
Now he said in effect , aren’t I creating a self-fulfilling prophecy here , because China wants to rise peacefully in the story uh , but yet the United States , because it’s being prudent , is creating a situation where you’ll have a clash down the road . It’s not uh , necessarily that you’ll have a shooting war . </s>
But you’ll certainly have an intense security competition as a result of my story . There’s no question about that with the possibility of the war . My argument is that the United States really has no choice . Because as China gets more and more powerful economically , the United States constantly bumps into the question of what China’s intentions will be ten , twenty , or thirty years down the road . And he says , the moderator , that China wants to rise peacefully . </s>
But he can’t assure me that China wants to rise peacefully or will rise peacefully . There’s just no way of knowing . </s>
And in a world where you have a state that’s becoming increasingly powerful , nearly as powerful as you , you have to assume worst case about its intentions to protect yourself in case there is trouble . Because as I said to you before , if you do get into trouble , there’s no 911 that you can appeal to . And in a very important way , it is a self-fulfilling prophecy , and this is why I titled the book that I wrote on this subject , the tragedy of great-power politics . This is a tragic situation . </s>
The United States simply has no choice but to assume the worst about China and the end result is that you’ll get that for sure . And on that happy note , Stapleton Roy . I spent my career as a diplomat and somehow the world wasn’t this Hobbesian picture that has been presented to us . Just think about it for a moment . </s>
If your goal is to keep everybody else down , you should n't be surprised to discover that nobody else shares that goal . Now successful foreign policies are based on finding common interests with other countries , not in trying to keep them down . If we try to keep China down , we’ll have to keep India down or whoever the next person is . </s>
What kind of a foreign policy and kind of a country are , are we if that’s our approach ? </s>
Think of it in another way . If our goal is to ensure the security and prosperity of the American people , in a world in which other countries have an equal right , if they can do so responsibly , to improve the prosperity and security of their people , then we have a world in which there are common goals , and which other countries can also raise the living standards of their people and meet their security needs better . The goal then of our foreign policy is responsible behavior in the international community . That’s a shared goal with most other countries and it’s an achievable goal . </s>
But it requires that we also set a good example . Now remember also the Western hemisphere is the only region of the world in which one power can be the hegemony . </s>
China is surrounded by Japan that has a conventional military capable , that’s equal to China’s . It’s surrounded by Russia , a nuclear power , by India , a nuclear power . By Vietnam which is no patsy , by Korea which is no patsy , and the United States is a permanent factor in the region . </s>
Chinese leaders do not spend their time thinking about dominating Asia through power . The way that they are increasing our influence is through influence . They’re reassuring their neighbors . </s>
They’re behaving in a way which leaves the Southeast Asian countries in the lead in promoting an East Asian community , not China . So it’s the country that throws its weight around that loses influence . And the country that uses its influence to promote its interest that is doing so more effectively . </s>
We ought to learn something from this . We are actually very good at playing this game when we realize that we can not accomplish our goals or keep a peaceful world if we rely on power as opposed to the right balance of power and influence . We certainly need to keep ourselves strong enough so a rising China does not threaten our prosperity and our security . But we don’t need to do so in a world where we have to keep everybody else down because of a threat to our hegemonic position . </s>
Thank you . May I , may I just say I still consider Ambassador Roy to be the fourth member of our team . Thank you , thank you very much for those comments . </s>
A balance of power is in fact the right approach . </s>
Michael Pillsbury is uh , is being a dissident . Uh , within the process , we uh , you know , need to keep the lines of the left and right absolutely clear here . Now we get to the interesting bit which is uh , over to you . Uh , what I’d like to do is uh , ask you to um , uh , you know , come forth with questions for the panel . </s>
Please make clear who you 're directing them to . Please , if you would n't mind , stand up when you ask a question . </s>
Um if you 're a member of the press , would you say so ? And would you identify yourself . And one final thing , would you do what I didn’t , which is keep your questions short and succinct . Right , there are two people here . There are people with mics , two up , two up at the front here . </s>
Thanks very much . This lady right in the middle . Um , hi , and my name is Lily , um , for John Mearsheimer . Uh , you say that we should want to maintain superiority to China , but just as the part of the fabric of America , shouldn’t we also want to concern ourselves with the human rights and the , uh , conditions in China ? My… </s>
Actually , uh , John Mearsheimer , if you don’t mind , we’re going to take a couple of questions , two or three together , and then we’re going to go on . Thank you very much . So there’s a gentleman over here who has a question . </s>
Uh , yeah , my name is Mike Endacott , um , this question is for Daniel Rosen . Um , does the example of Hong Kong , and uh , China’s before towards Hong Kong give us any clear picture of their future intentions ? Thank you very much . </s>
Let’s start with those two , John Mearsheimer , should we not pay more attention to human rights than just our own interests ? The point that I tried to make in my comments was that the state can have a variety of different interests , and promoting human rights , or protecting human rights and promoting democracy can be , and often are legitimate goals of states , especially the United States . But the highest goal always has to be , uh , protecting your security , maintaining your survival . </s>
And the point that I tried to make clear here is that the best way to maximize your chances of surviving in the system are to make sure that you are by far the most powerful state , because then nobody can fool around with you . </s>
And once you have ensured your survival , you are of course then free to pursue those other goals . Thank you . Daniel Rosen , what does Hong Kong tell us ? Hong Kong tells us a lot . Uh , the , the motion we’re debating tonight , with regard to the meta-phenomenon of China’s strengthening , uh , and coming back into a position , uh , of relative strength after a century of relative weakness could easily have been debated in the more narrow context of Hong Kong ten years ago . </s>
About ten years ago today , in fact , uh , almost . Uh , or , or a month away . Uh , people assuming that China’s reassumption of control over Hong Kong would necessarily bring , uh , a cauldron of concerns and troubles about Hong Kong’s fate . In fact , uh , things have played out entirely differently than that . </s>
Uh , China has left Hong Kong to manage its own affairs , in the same way at Beijing , to a great extent , is allowing many regions of the country within mainland China to manage their own affairs . Probably too much so . We probably need a stronger Beijing rather than a weaker one , in fact . Uh , Hong Kong is prospering . </s>
Its success or failure stands on its own competitiveness . This is precisely what we should learn form the situation . </s>
Hong Kong can do better or worse , it has less to do with Beijing than it does to do with Hong Kong . </s>
The United States can benefit or be at a relative loss as a result of China’s economic growth . It has everything to do with the choices we make , and how we choose to respond , instead of trying to adjust our game to respond to what China wants to do instead . Thank you very much . Right , yeah , the two gentleman , just up , uh , then let’s take a couple of , uh , questions from you two please . </s>
Uh , and then , uh , I saw there’s someone right up at the back . Thank you . Thank you . My name is Gerry Ohrstrom . Given Frederic Bastiat’s empirically proven statement where goods cross borders , armies won’t , I’d like to ask the friendly Mr. Pillsbury if he truly believes that a wealthy China poses a greater threat to America and to the world and to the region than an impoverished China . </s>
Others , I think Mr. Hilsh- , Mearsheimer clearly an- , answered that question . </s>
I’d like to get your direct answer . Thank you very much . So the gentleman in the back . </s>
Hi . </s>
Uh , I guess this is for Mr. Mearsheimer . He was saying that the , the uh , military strength is the key to controlling China , but it seems that we can’t really do anything in Iraq to control Iraq . How are we ever gon na control China ? And really , economically , since they have trillions of dollars pouring into their country , and we’re running a major , major deficit , how would we ever possibly finance a military that could overcome China ? </s>
I mean , they have so much more money in the bank now , and it seems like in the foreseeable future , that’s going to be the case . So shouldn’t we focus on being economic partners with them and trading partners as Ambassador Roy said , and seek common ground rather than sort of pursue this military concept , which isn’t working anywhere for us ? Thank you . </s>
And the gentleman here in the bow tie please . </s>
Uh , my question also is to Mr. Mearsheimer . Um , so- , sorry to pile on you , but um , why do you believe contrary to , uh , every example in recorded history that the United States can continue , uh , to be the most powerful nation in the world ? And in what way are the citizens of those countries which used to be the most powerful nations in the world , Sweden , the Netherlands , Great Britain , uh , any worser off now that they are no longer citizens of the most powerful nation in the world ? Thank you for that very understanding question . Uh , let , let’s um , let’s start first , uh , though with the question , uh , for Michael Pillsbury about a , a wealthy China surely being better for America and the world than an impoverished one . </s>
Uh , I prefer a wealthy China to a poor , angry China . Uh , I think the , the issue though… PANELIST I think Michael just joined our side . PANELIST 2 It’s about time . PANELIST It’s an even trade . PANELIST 2 State Department’s always thinking the allies . </s>
I think the issue is really democracy , and a wealthy democratic China is a better partner for us , a better ally , a better friend than a poor , than even a poor democratic China . The problem is how to get from here to there without being foolishly naïve in building up China’s economic strength in a way that they also maintain their nationalism . They maintain their anti-American views , and they , uh , it ends , the situation ends up that we have been gullible and naïve over a fifteen or twenty year period . And this has happened before . If you read John Mearsheimer’s most recent book , it really chronicles a number of times this has happened in world politics . </s>
So if you really want to support our side of the resolution , you need to be thinking about this phrase the moderator used , which I love , I think he’s working for us too , “Don’t worry , Be Happy.” </s>
Because that’s what their side really is advocating . </s>
What I am saying , be wary in the following four or five ways . We need to continue our military exchange program with the Chinese military , and let them see that we’re not their enemy . We don’t want to call that off because “don’t worry be happy.” </s>
We need to continue the embargo on arms sales to China . We shouldn’t sell weapons to China . </s>
We should continue the Eur- , our support that the European Union has its embargo on arms sales to China , until human rights improves significantly . We should continue to do something about Taiwan’s defense . We don’t have to arm them to the teeth , but we shouldn’t just walk away from Taiwan . And finally , we need to have technology limits on our most advanced technology that we transfer to China . Right now , it’s very generous , but there are a few things we hold back , and some people say that was part of their successful test against the satellite in space , is that they had some western technology , uh , at their , at their service . </s>
And frankly , I don’t know if all of you know as , perhaps as civilians , ninety percent of your military forces go through satellites . Communications , intelligence , also and every time you use an ATM card , that’s a satellite conveyed transaction . So we are a highly vulnerable society with our four hundred satellites in space . This test is very serious in January , and the Chinese government after repeated requests has no explanation for it . They just say , “Oh , don’t worry about it . </s>
Don’t worry , be happy.” </s>
Thank you very much… …let me see if there’s… . …We’ll come back in one moment . </s>
Just to John Mearsheimer , could you take on both of those questions , essentially the question of whether or not American hegemony should or can afford to continue forever ? Yeah . You , you wan na let Daniel… No , no , go ahead , John Mearsheimer , and then we’ll turn to Daniel Rosen in a moment . Oh , very quickly , on all three questions . </s>
The first one said where goods cross borders , armies don’t . Uh , I think that’s empirically wrong , and there was a tremendous amount of economic interdependence in Europe before World War I , uh , and World War I still happened . And if you look at German-Soviet relations in 1941 , there was actually a tremendous amount of economic intercourse , and yet you still had , uh , World War II . And during the Cold War , in fact , you had hardly any economic intercourse between the United States and the Soviet Union , and nevertheless you never had a shooting war . </s>
Now on the question of whether or not we could possibly contain China , uh , which gets into two other questions that I was asked , uh , and the person pointed out , how could we possibly contain China when we can’t even deal with Iraq ? Uh , I would vote that going to war in Iraq was a completely crazy idea from the beginning , and whether or not you can fight the war in Iraq is a very different issue than whether you can contain China down the road . And the analogy I would point to that makes this quite obvious is our experience in Vietnam , and at the same time our experience containing and defeating the Soviet Union during the Cold War . The Vietnam War , like the Iraq War was a completely cockamamie idea . </s>
Uh , but nevertheless , the United States , even though it lost in Vietnam still won the Cold War . Uh , and there no question that the United States should avoid , should avoid fighting Iraqs down the road . But it clearly has the wherewithal , uh , to uh , finance the defenses to , to contain China down the road . </s>
And this gets to the final question , which is , can the United States remain number one forever , and if we don’t , we’ll be , will we be that badly off ? </s>
Uh , first of all , nothing is forever , so the United States is not going to remain number one forever . But I would be willing to bet a lot of money that the United States is actually more powerful relative to the rest of the world over the course of this century , largely for demographic reasons , uh , than it is right now . Uh , a lot of the doomsayers , who say that the United States is in real trouble down the road are simply wrong , in my opinion . And I think a powerful case can be made contrary to what we’re talking about up here that China won’t rise , uh , anywhere near as much as many people think it will . </s>
And getting into the final points , are we worse off , or we will be worse off not being so powerful ? Look at the Europeans . </s>
Well , if you look at Europe in recent times , that’s true . But let’s go back to 1900 and think about being a Pole anywhere from 1900 to 2007 . Think about growing up in France anytime between 1900 and 2007 . </s>
Yeah , the last few decades have been pretty good , uh , but if you look at the broader sweep of history , it looks mighty nasty . And who’s to tell what the future looks like , many of you assume that it’s gon na be peace , love and forever , right , I mean Europe has been pacified , war has been burned out of Europe . </s>
Maybe , maybe not . I’m just a very prudent person . </s>
I don’t like to take chances . And that means that I just prefer to be much more powerful rather than as powerful as the other states in the system . </s>
Right thank you very much , John Mearsheimer . A very quick response from Daniel Rosen . </s>
This is gon na start to sound like a George Bernard Shaw play , but I’m with Pillsbury . Uh , a , a wealthy democratic China is clearly in the U.S. interest . </s>
Be wary of arguments that you can foster democracy in China by stymieing the boom . </s>
A boom doesn’t guarantee democratization . </s>
A bust guarantees that you will not get there . That can be said pretty clearly . And we already see early evidence of democratization processes starting to take place . </s>
People elect their own co-op boards . They decide who represents them in their parent-teacher associations in their schools . This is happening already . And everybody who’s been stymieing China sees it manifested . Thank you very much . </s>
Right , a few more questions . And , uh , I don’t want this New York audience to get a bad reputation , so if anyone wants to throw a punch at the side that’s against the motion , please feel free . </s>
The gentleman here on the left . I’ll see what I can do . Um , uh , if we held this debate , uh , twenty years ago , you’d probably insert Japan for China . Uh , at that time , and , and we see that that kind of played out a different way , despite what Michael Crichton might think . Um , that said , how does Japan kind of enter into the debate here ? </s>
I mean , if you think about it , um , there is some , uh , scholarship or some theory that suggests that we should think about Japan as a bulwark against a rising China , and I’d like to get fielder’s choice from the panelists , what , how do they think Japan , um , plays in , you know , in terms of the constitution , in terms of rearmament . How can they pl- , play a constructive role in perhaps bringing some coma- , accommodation in Asia ? Thank you very much . </s>
And , uh , the gentleman up there in the blue shirt ? </s>
Thanks . This is for the speakers against the motion . </s>
Um , you had said that China has no ideology , and yet if a booming China means that U.S. is increasingly dependant on China , and yet China has shown it’s ab- , um , it’s interest in supporting rogue or failed states , such as Sudan . And yet because of our dependence on China we’re- , that inhibits our ability to intervene in those situations , how would you respond to that ? Thank you very much . </s>
Let’s uh , we’ll come to you in one moment . </s>
Uh , let’s start , Jim McGregor , do you want to deal with uh , Japan ? And who’d like to deal with uh , China’s role in Sudan ? </s>
Let’s start with Japan . Well no , I , I wan na address where he talks about us being dependant on China . Who’s dependant on whom here ? Look at the eco- , I mean , no one’s talking about the Chinese people and the economic times . </s>
China’s oil companies , China’s banks , China’s telecom companies are all listed on overseas stock exchanges . They’re , they’re , they were the second biggest buyers of U.S. treasuries . They’re completely tied into us , we’re not , we’re not dependant on China in any , in any way shape or form . We’re tied together , which is for the common good . </s>
A country that is tied together that deeply and economically and we’re , and the , the amount of jobs that are created by the consumers in America , by the foreign companies , sixty-some percent of exports from China come from foreign companies . So we’re so intertwined , uh , it , it just brings more stability . </s>
But Jim McGregor , doesn’t this question cut to exactly that problem ? </s>
We’re having two debates here this evening . On the right hand side , you have people who are talking about foreign policy and national security . And on the left hand side , we have people talking about economic growth and commercial opportunity . </s>
And actually when you , when it , you come to it , when you look at a case like Sudan , when you look at China’s involvement in Zimbabwe , actually we’re failing to address or engage China in constructive diplomatic , uh , you know , work around the world . Well if you look at , what have we done ? China now is awash with money , and they’re looking to invest overseas . When they came to buy Unocal , uh , which pumped I think point eight percent of American oil , Congress looked at this at a national security threat and pushed them away . And we’ve pushed Middle East out of Chin- , out of the U.S. already , they’re going to China . </s>
China’s now going out in the world to invest and we’re starting to push them away . This isn’t , this isn’t , uh , this isn’t the Philistines of the business community against the honorable people of the Ph.D. world . </s>
This is commercial reality versus theory . </s>
Thank you very much . Uh , f- , a couple more questions , the lady up here , on the right hand side , middle of , down the , down here . </s>
And there’s a gentleman , uh , mauve shirt in the middle . </s>
Hi , my name is Jolie Hunt . This is for James McGregor . Speaking of commercial realities , I’m very surprised that censorship hasn’t come up , uh , especially as we’re against this motion . And it doesn’t seem like we’re , we’re comparing apples to apples here , it’s more like bullets to grenades . And if we have to act like responsible citizens , how can we not , uh , pay attention when China doesn’t . </s>
So , so the question comes to censorship and the notion that , uh , companies like Google and Yahoo , uh , have to , uh , make restrictions in news and information there and , and how can we compete with them in , in saying that America can take it ? </s>
It seems to be rather naïve . PANELIST You’re not allowed to answer that . Thank you . Hmm ? PANELIST You’re not allowed to answer that . </s>
…and this uh , gentleman here ? Um , hi . My name is John Silverman . Can you hear me ? Yeah . </s>
This is for any one of the gentlemen against the motion . Here’s my question . China’s ability to bring , uh , produce goods for far less than America has cost untold numbers of our citizens to lose their job . </s>
Doesn’t that mean that the China boom has already caused trouble for America ? Thank you very much . Um , who’d like to start with that question , Jim McGregor do you want to talk about the outsourcing problem ? </s>
Uh , no , I’ll talk about censorship , because that’s , I’m , I’m in the media . OK , OK , you’re gon na , Do- , Dan , OK , let’s start , uh , Daniel Rosen with outsourcing . And we’re gon na have to keep it relatively short , I’m afraid . Right , uh , the um , automobile industry was a terrible , terrible threat to the horse and buggy industry here in New York City . </s>
In fact , there’s practically , we’re down to about a hundred people in horse and buggy now , and they’re all in Central Park . </s>
Uh , the U.S. , unlike , uh , almost every other , uh , great power that we’ve seen , has shown itself entirely open to change , to adjustment . </s>
Instead of trying to defend , uh , an increasingly uncompetitive status quo , we’ve found ways to innovate , the adjust , to continue to be competitive , despite the changes that necessarily take place in the world around us today . Trouble is a given , change is a given . It’s unfortunate , it’s different for people that are faced with the immediate consequences of it , but there is really very little alternative to it . </s>
Finally , we have a four and a half percent unemployment rate in this country . How much lower do we really want it to go ? </s>
Thank you . </s>
On the commercial realities part , I’d like to get in a word there , uh… Sorry , Bill Gertz , yes . Yeah , uh , the issue of uh , China’s proliferation activities hasn’t been raised , but China , uh , as , uh , many of us know , gave nuclear technology to Pakistan in the , uh , ‘80’s and ‘90’s . That nuclear technology ended up going to Libya , and uh , Iran and North Korea . And uh , they even found Chinese language nuclear warhead design documents when they dismantled Libya’s nuclear program . </s>
Uh , Chinese companies since 2001 have been sanctioned more than eighty times . And uh , they’re doing this as part of a policy that’s usually denied by the central government , but in reality , uh , uh , China is helping these rogue states with its , uh , with weapons technology , both missiles and weapons of mass destruction . Thank you very much , Bill Gertz . </s>
And finally onto censorship . I , I , well I’m against that too , thank you . </s>
Um , on censorship , the quick answer is the internet has changed China , and , and China is fighting a losing battle every day with information . You wouldn’t believe what is on the blogs . Um , Google handled it okay , Yahoo handled it terribly . </s>
What Google did is they had to be in that market , I’m glad they’re in that market because they’re pushing the envelope on , on freedom of information . And what they did is they labeled their searches that they’re censored , which drove the Chinese government crazy . Yahoo , on the other hand , caved right in , gave them names of people that were using Yahoo email accounts . </s>
Um , we have to be there , we have to be pushing for freedom on information , and it’s happening , let the Chinese people do it . Jim McGregor , thank you very much . Um , I know that many more of you have questions . I’m afraid , uh , we’re not gon na have time for them , but please feel free to maul our panelists after the debate . </s>
Um , the uh , we now , the final um , stage of this is that uh , each of the panelists gets two minutes , uh , to sum up . </s>
And we start with , Stape Roy . </s>
PANELIST Start with… PANELIST 2 Yeah . </s>
PANELIST Start with Jim McGregor . PANELIST 2 No , we’re starting with Jim . Oh sorry , yeah , it says Jim , but since Stapleton , go ahead . Jim McGregor . Yeah , oh , I , I don’t really know what there is to add to this , other than we really haven’t been talking about the Chinese people at all . </s>
Why don’t we give them a chance ? </s>
The Chinese people are , are moving ahead very quickly . They are not idiots , they’re very smart . They’re pushing their government every day . We’re trying to tell them you must be Democrats tomorrow . </s>
The last time they took an , a government system from the west , it was Communism . They don’t want another one of those . Um , give them the time to find their own way . You talk about , uh , the string of pearls , uh , strategy . The string of pearls strategy I see every day in the markets when people are bargaining for pearls . </s>
Uh , they don’t want to come and attack America , they want to come here and go to Vegas , they want to go to Colorado skiing , they wan na shop on Rodeo Drive . The Chinese are joining the world . This is not a , a country , uh , run by monsters who want to take over the United States . They just want to be somebody in the world , and if , if we handle them with some , uh , some skill and some , uh , some sympathy . But also tough where they are violating international rules like proliferation and intellectual property rights , the U.S. and China can have a very good relationship . </s>
I would just like to , uh , say please , um , do not tell uh , uh , Secretary Gates that um , that Mr. Pillsbury who works at the Department of Defense has asked you to vote against America tonight . America can , America can handle China . Thank you , thank you . </s>
Thank you very much , Jim McGregor . Now John Mearsheimer , for the motion . Ambassador Roy made the point that Chinese leaders today don’t think about dominating Asia . And I think he’s correct . They don’t . </s>
And the reason that they don’t is because they do not have the wherewithal or anything near the wherewithal to think about dominating Ch- , uh , dominating Asia . The question you have to ask yourself is how are the Chinese likely to think when they look something like the United States today , when they really are very , very powerful ? </s>
To give you an analogy , it’s like having money . Uh , I’ve gotten wealthier over time , which is not to say I’ve gotten wealthy . But I’ve gotten wealthier over time , I’ve accumulated more money . </s>
And I think about spending that money and doing things with that money in very different ways now that I have it than I did when I didn’t have two nickels to rub together . And the point that I would make to you about China is that there’s gon na come a point , uh , in the story that we’re telling up here , where China is extremely powerful . And I think then , it will begin to think about subjects like Taiwan very differently . Of course the Chinese don’t want to pick a fight with the United States now over Taiwan , they know what would happen , they would get clobbered . </s>
The question you have to ask yourself is in a world where China has a huge Navy , a much bigger and more efficient Army , more missiles , right , and the United States is at a significant disadvantage in East Asia , which is a great distance away from this country , how do you think China will then think about Taiwan and the possibility of using threats ? I’d bet a lot of money that they’ll think very differently and it won’t be to our advantage . John Mearsheimer , thank you very much . </s>
Now against the motion , Daniel Rosen . So much has been said , two quick concluding points . Firstly , are we confident that our institutions , our way of going about growing an economy , spending our lives is profoundly superior , better to the way China is organized ? To the problems of China we’ve discussed this evening ? </s>
I’m confident . And thus I’m confident that for China to match us in terms of wealth creation , prosperity over time , they’ll necessarily have to move in the direction of our institutions , our way of behaving in the world . I have no doubt about that . Secondly , the problems that are existential in nature , really threaten our welfare today , are no longer realist in nature . Maybe unfortunately . </s>
The greatest force projection on planet Earth could not stop 9/11 from taking place in this city , could it ? The challenges of global environmental change , climate chance , can not be addressed in any way whatsoever with for- , force projection . We are in trouble already . Is there trouble down the road ? </s>
There’s trouble here today . The question is what evolution of China best serves our interest in addressing those troubles and minimizing the trouble our children will have to deal with , we’ll have to deal with for the rest of our careers . It seems abundantly clear to me that a China stronger , more prosperous , further down the road to Democracy as well , uh , is what we want to see as we turn to address all these problems which can no longer be dealt with just by the U.S. Navy . Thanks . </s>
Daniel Rosen , thank you very much . Now for the motion , Michael Pillsbury . Thank you . Uh , I forgot to quote from Nancy Pelosi a little bit earlier , uh , because you keep referring to us as the right , I thought perhaps you should hear a couple of sentences from the Speaker of the House of Representatives . She was attacking President Bush last April during the visit of Hu Jintao . </s>
She said that she opposed the celebratory nature of the official visit . She said our own debt , uh , with China is growing so fast , they’ll soon be making our foreign policy . She said trickle-down liberty is not going to work , it’s an illusion . </s>
She said that we should avoid wishful thinking about China ever being a , becoming a responsible stakeholder . She said our trade relationship with China has been a disaster , despite more than a decade of concessions , the trade deficit with China has grown from four billion a year to more than four billion a week . China continues to manipulate its currency , making its exports cheaper and U.S. imports more expensive than they would be in a free market condition . </s>
If President Bush kowtows to Beijing in ways that threaten our long-standing commitment to Taiwan , members of both parties in Congress will be watching . She concluded by saying the American people wanted the administration to show resolve in standing up to Beijing . </s>
So all of you supporters in the audience of George Bush , be sure to vote for the other team . PANELIST You’re gon na vote with us then , right ? Because here is Nancy Pelosi , rather articulately saying “Beware the Dragon : The boom in China spells trouble for America.” An extraordinary Intelligence Squared moment there , Michael Pelosi , Michael , I was gon na say Michael Pelosi , Michael Pillsbury channeling his inner Nancy Pelosi , thank you very much . Stapleton Roy now going to channel , I don’t know who , I think Stapleton Roy finishing up against the motion . </s>
Let’s look at the process . China was outside the system , thirty years ago . It favored polar variation . We have had trouble with China every stage of the process , but it’s been moving toward becoming a more responsible part of the international community . </s>
It signed a nuclear non-proliferation treaty in 1992 . It signed a comprehensive test ban treaty two years later . </s>
It now cooperates with the missile technology control regime . We’ve sanctioned them in various way at every stage of this process , China has improved . But it has been troublesome . So it’s not easy to deal with China . But look at the trend . </s>
Look at Asia . Asia is the one country in the , uh , the one region of the world where every authoritarian system that has gone through thirty to forty years of rapid economic development , has stayed open to the outside world , has been embedded in the global economic system , and it’s had friendly relations with the United States , has moved from authoritarian systems of government to representative forms of government , no exceptions . South Korea , Taiwan , Thailand , Indonesia . </s>
China’s only partway along that . It’s a strategic gamble . If China doesn’t become wealthier , it’s not going to become democratic . But if China becomes wealthier , it becomes more powerful . </s>
That’s a challenge for our diplomacy . Are we up to it ? You bet we are . We’re good at it . </s>
When we give ourselves a chance . We know how to use the right balance of power and influence , and if we get it right , China can we a more prosperous , friendly country to the United States . It’s not going to run roughshod in its own neighborhood because it’ll be slapped down by not just the United States . We don’t have to deal with China alone . If we have good relations with Japan , with Russia , with India , and with the other countries of East Asia , China is not going to have the opportunity . </s>
That’ s our challenge . It’s a good challenge . I say neither beware nor embrace the dragon . Be realistic and advance our own interests intelligently… </s>
Stapleton Roy , your time . Thank you very much.. PANELIST Bravo , bravo , . And finally , for the motion , Bill Gertz . Yes , thank , I , I wan na thank the Intelligence Squared for this debate . I think it’s a very important , uh , debate . </s>
And the debate we’re having tonight I think is reflective of a debate that’s currently going on at the highest levels of the U.S. government . And that debate can be characterized , uh , on the one side you have Condoleezza Rice going to Beijing shortly before she became Secretary of State and said , “We want a strong China.” On the other side of the debate are people in the national security community , the Pentagon , who said , “Wait a minute . </s>
There are so many unknowns about China . We don’t know what takes place . We don’t know.” </s>
When we have all of these military exchanges that Mike Pillsbury talks about , one of the first questions is , “What is the extent of the military buildup of China ? ” The Chinese will not answer . </s>
When you combine that with China’s use of deception , that is , deliberate strategic misinformation to misguide us . </s>
We know very little about it . Therefore it is , it is dangerous in my view that we should , uh , want to see a strong China , and that , uh , really we have to keep our powder dry until we can find out what goes on in the inner councils of , of the Chinese system . Uh , and for that reason , I , I urge you to vote uh , for the motion tonight . Bill Gertz , thank you very much . Well , that uh , brings to and end , the um , the talking , and now for the action . </s>
We return to these uh , crazy contraptions , your um , your voting pads . Please uh , pick them up again , and let’s see if I can get it right this time . Could you , in , in voting , press “one” if you’re for the motion , “two” if you’re against the motion , and “three” if you’re still undecided . So could you cast your vote now ? Michael Pillsbury has just told me that it’s like American Idol , um… I’m not sure on that basis , uh , who will win . </s>
PANELIST …they’ll kick us all off . </s>
Exactly . </s>
Um , now before um , before I tell you the results of the vote , I just want to take care of couple of things . Firstly , I’d like to thank our panel of debaters , Stapleton Roy , Daniel Rosen , uh , Jim McGregor , Michael Pillsbury , John Mearsheimer , and Bill Gertz , thank you very much indeed.. I also would like to thank you , the audience , for your , uh , thoughtful engagement , uh , here this evening . Don’t need to give yourself another round of applause , that was more than good enough . Um , but then of course I’d really like to thank , uh , Intelligence Squared , which was brought this , uh , the eighth , uh , and final debate of this season , um , uh , here to the U.S . Uh , it’s been an extraordinary success and brought really substantive and complicated issues to be , to be debated and be discussed , uh , in , in what I hope you’ll agree is a very en- , engaging and thought provoking way . </s>
Um , you will of course be hungering for the next debate , and uh , it is “Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea.” Uh , it , that will be held , on uh , Tuesday , September the 18th . </s>
“Spreading democracy in the Middle East is a bad idea.” Um , before you maul our panelists , you may want to uh , rush out and uh , get tickets for the full season . </s>
And while I’m doing the plugs , let me tell you that if you want to go and listen to this whole thing all over again , you certainly should do on WNYC , uh , AM820 on Friday , May the 25th , at uh , seven in the evening . And we’re very uh , uh , much appreciate , uh , the support from them . </s>
And , and again , there are copies of books by Bill Gertz and Jim McGregor , you know , which are for sale upstairs . Uh , and there are also DVDs of previous debates available from Intelligence Squared . Uh , while I’m about it , I should tell you there are copies of The Times of London newspaper upstairs , so pick one of those up , they , they have the , uh , glorious advantage of being free this evening for you . Uh , now , finally , let’s get to business . </s>
What are the results of the debate ? Now , let me remind you where you stood before the debate . </s>
Forty-one percent were for the motion , and just so I do this properly , “Beware the Dragon : A booming China , ” sorry , “Beware the Dragon : A booming China spells trouble for America.” Before the debate , forty-one percent for the motion , thirty-seven percent against the motion , twenty-one percent undecided . </s>
After the debate , 35 percent for the motion , 58.6 percent against the motion , 6.1 percent undecided . The team against the motion wins . Thank you very much indeed . </s>
And now I would like to introduce the chairman of Intelligence Squared U.S. , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . Thank you . Welcome . </s>
It’s good to have you here . </s>
My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate . </s>
So , `` China does capitalism better than America.” Capitalism is the polar opposite of Communism , so how can Communist China be said to do capitalism better than America ? It’s because China is Communist in name only . </s>
In most of the ways that matter , the Chinese economy is a model of capitalism . Firms and individuals are largely free to buy the labor technology and raw materials they need to produce the products they want in open competition with others and to sell them at whatever prices the market will bear . If you include government-controlled firms , goods produced in a market system account for a substantially larger share of China’s output than they do in America . Capitalism requires capital to invest , and over the past 30 years , China has saved nearly half of its total output and has invested most of those savings in capital assets -- plants , machinery , infrastructure , and the like . </s>
In contrast , the American savings rates have been puny , only recently reaching 6 percent of total production . And the promise of capitalism is that by allowing individuals and firms the freedom to act , resources will be allocated efficiently and the wealth and consumption of most people in the society will grow . China has done a phenomenal job of keeping that promise . </s>
Over the past 30 years , its economy has grown approximately tenfold while America’s has barely doubled . In what respects then does America do capitalism better ? </s>
Clearly , the rule of law is much more developed here . Property rights are more secure , and we encourage innovation by protecting intellectual property . As a result , the American economy is far more innovative . The Googles and Facebooks and Apples of the world are American companies . Nothing comparable has come from China . </s>
We permit individuals to move freely in search of jobs and opportunities . For hundreds of millions of rural Chinese , there is no such freedom . Corruption and abuse of power by government officials is far more prevalent in China . And crony capitalism , which is certainly an aspect of American life , is absolutely rife in China . </s>
As usual , there is a lot to be said on both sides . And in the final analysis , this debate is not just about economics but about which system , American democratic capitalism or Chinese state capitalism , will be the model that developing countries around the world admire and seek to emulate . We have an outstanding panel of experts tonight , and it’s my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator John Donvan . Thank you . </s>
Thank you . Thank you very much . </s>
And I would just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosencranz for making these possible . </s>
Yes or no to this statement : `` China does capitalism better than America.” Well , perception can say a lot , and in a recent poll , 53 percent of Americans identified China as the world’s leading financial power . </s>
Only 33 percent said the U.S. is number one . Guess what ? The U.S. is still number one . The 53 percent who say that China is first are wrong . Or are they simply early ? </s>
I’m John Donvan . Welcome to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. Our motion is `` China does capitalism better than America.” We have four superbly qualified debaters , two teams of two who will argue for this motion and against this motion . We go in three rounds of debate . </s>
Then the audience votes to choose the winner , and only one team wins . Our debaters , each connected in his own way to the China story : Orville Schell , who heads the Center for U.S.-China Relations at the Asia Society . Your partner is Peter Schiff who heads Euro Pacific Capital and who has advised Ron Paul . On the side arguing against the motion that China does capitalism better than America , Ian Bremmer , founder and president of Eurasia Group . And your partner Minxin Pei , professor of government at Claremont McKenna College . </s>
Orville Schell , many hats on your head . </s>
You are a journalist and now an in-house thinker at the Asia Society . You were coming and going to China already 30 years ago when doing such a thing here was seen as really beyond exotic , and then before that as an undergraduate at Harvard , you studied Far Eastern History . So , since you were a teenager , China has counted for you . What sparked this interest for you in the first place ? </s>
Well , paradoxically , I think it was the fact that you couldn’t go there , and that lent a kind of a quality to it that was somewhat mysterious and begged effort to bridge that gap . Is that fun over now ? No , because China still is a fickle mistress and a very difficult place to finally divine . All right . </s>
Your debating partner is Peter Schiff . Peter is CEO of Euro Pacific Capital . </s>
And Peter , you advised Ron Paul in 2008 , and talk about being right early . You called the U.S. housing bubble long before most people even saw it coming . And you’re a guy who makes predictions , and you speak the language of inevitability and you don’t give yourself a lot of room to back away in case you turn out to be wrong . But on China-U.S. , what if you turn out to be wrong ? Well , first of all , in fairness to Congressman Ron Paul , he really didn’t need my advice . </s>
He should be giving advice to his opponents . </s>
But as far as China , being wrong in what respect ? Are you talking about my investments in China ? For example . Yeah , you know , I think that China’s story is unfolding , and I think there is tremendous opportunity for investors to make money as China continues on its journey towards capitalism . </s>
I think they are abandoning some of the ideas of the past , not necessarily in favor of what America is today . </s>
Hopefully maybe more what America used to be in the past . But if I’m wrong , if the political winds blow in a different direction and China doesn’t live up to the potential that I think it has , I’ve got investments all around the world . It’s not only China . That’s a relief . </s>
But -- Thank you Peter Schiff . I just want to bring it over to the other side . Our motion is `` China does capitalism better than America.” And Ian Bremmer , you are arguing against that motion . </s>
Ian , you went to college when you were 16 . </s>
You won a MacArthur Fellowship at -- Fifteen -- I lied about my age , but it was 15 . -- at age 22 . MacArthur Fellowship at 22 , Hoover National Fellow at 25 . At 28 , you founded the global risk consultancy called the Eurasia Group . So , in Ian Bremmer years , it’s like the rest of us are dead and buried . </s>
So , with all the work and all the thinking you do , where do you rank China among the things that you think about ? Oh , you know , over the last couple of years , we’ve been spending our time thinking about the United States in terms of the financial crisis , the European crisis , and now everyone wants to know about Iran . </s>
And of course , the fact is -- and this is one thing that all four of us I think will agree on -- the most important question that we need to answer is ultimately the disposition of China over the next five , 10 years . We’ve taken our eye off that ball . It’s going to get back . And your partner also saying that China does not do capitalism better than America , Minxin Pei . </s>
Minxin , you are a professor at Claremont McKenna . You were born in China , but you’ve been here 27 years and counting . You’re a dual citizen . You also have another duality . </s>
You’re a political scientist with a Harvard Ph.D. , but you also have a Master’s in creative writing . </s>
So , what does that tell us ? What’s the aspiration ? First of all , I want to correct , I only have U.S. citizenship . The Chinese government will not allow me to have dual citizenship . Well , having two terminal degrees gives me enormous advantage because most political scientists can not write clearly -- -- because I have this creative writing degree , I can write more clearly than many of my colleagues . </s>
All right . </s>
Thank you , Minxin . And let’s let this debate begin . We have explained that we want to have you vote two times tonight . </s>
You are our judges are -- you , our live audience , serve as our judges . We have you vote now your conviction on this motion . We have you vote again at the end of the debate to tell us which side you think has actually presented the better argument . So , if you go to the keypads at your seat , our motion is `` China does capitalism better than America.” If you agree with the motion , if you’re with this side at this point , you press number one . </s>
If you disagree with this side , you push number two . </s>
And if you 're undecided , you push number three . And you can ignore the other keys and also if you press the wrong key just correct it and the system will lock in your last vote . And so we 're going to hold onto that result and we 're going to present both results at the very end of the debate in the moment that we decide -- that you decide who the victor is . </s>
Okay , on to round one . Round one is opening statements from each debater in turn . These statements are uninterrupted . They are seven minutes each . And to speak first for the motion , Peter Schiff , CEO for Euro Pacific Capital . </s>
You can -- no , we -- I just explained , we save them to the end . They both come at the end , and -- yeah , but the suspense will kill you throughout the evening . I 'll need a timer . </s>
All right , it 's -- </s>
I 'm going to say some nice things about you for a moment . Oh , okay . Go right ahead . Very briefly . Peter Schiff is CEO for Euro Pacific Capital . </s>
He writes books , he has a radio show , the radio show is named after you , so there 's no burden of false modesty or reticence here -- -- luckily for us . Ladies and gentlemen -- </s>
Well , I 'm the only one on the show . </s>
-- ladies and gentlemen , Peter Schiff . That 's all you can come up with ? </s>
As was stated , China is a communist nation in name only . It 's not communist in the way the Soviet Union was communist . </s>
And unfortunately China kind of gives communism a good name in a way that we give capitalism a bad name . And I thought maybe a more appropriate way to have framed this debate is not , you know , `` Does China do capitalism better ? '' but it might -- but might be , `` Does America do capitalism worse than China ? '' because neither modern America or China does capitalism anywhere near as well as we did it in the 19th century . </s>
But the problem is China is closer to what America used to be than America is today . And if you think about America at the end of the 19th century in the year 1900 , the government in this country spent 3 percent of the GDP on all levels , 3 percent . Today the American government spends better than 40 percent of our GDP . If you look at China , it 's about half as much of the GDP spent . </s>
If you look at taxes , which is a real measure of freedom , back in America in the 1900s , we had no income taxes , we had no corporate income tax , no state income taxes , Americans were truly free in the sense that they got to keep the production , the fruits of their labor . If you look at modern America and modern China , taxes are very high . They 're just a lot higher here than they are in China . Individual income taxes , the typical American pays a much higher share of his income in taxes when you take income taxes on a federal and state level and payroll taxes and the employer portion that 's passed on , paying much higher income taxes on a personal level than the typical Chinese worker does . </s>
If you look at corporations , our corporate income tax now is , what , 35 percent , China 's 25 , we tax dividends at 15 percent , they 're at 10 percent , so a significant difference in the amount of money that the individuals are allowed to keep . You know , the American government is taking a much larger share of what people earn , and that 's what 's freedom , it 's keeping the fruits of your labor . Also , if you look at the regulatory environment in both China and the United States , I would argue that a young entrepreneur in America today is going to face much greater hurdles , bigger obstacles in his path that have been placed there by the government than you would have in China . </s>
The costs of complying with all the rules and regulations in America exceeds the costs in China , and not just the rules and regulations , but surviving the litigation that is a byproduct of those rules and regulations . </s>
A lot of the things that the government does , if employers do n't do them properly , they open themselves up to all sorts of lawsuits , not just by government but by their employees or their customers and you do n't face that kind of problem to anywhere near that extent in China . So if you look at it from the point of view of taxation , you look at it from the point of view of regulation , sure , both countries have a lot of regulation . </s>
I mean , China is not as capitalistic as Hong Kong , which is a part of China but is more capitalistic than the mainland . But if you 're going to compare it to the United States , the level of taxation , the level of government spending , if you look at the debt , I mean , America has -- our government has an enormous debt . </s>
Our debt is now 100 percent of our GDP , and that is if you just count the funded portion of our debt . If you look at the off budget items , the unfunded portion of our debt , it 's enormous . The Chinese government does n't have anywhere near that kind of liability . </s>
In fact , if you look at China and the United States and just compare the results of their economy . China is today , the world’s largest creditor nation . America is the world’s biggest debtor nation . China has large trade surpluses . America has enormous trade deficits . </s>
So if you thought about it as a nation , China has got -- I mean if you thought about the nation as a country , or as a corporation rather , China has a lot of assets on its balance sheet and lots of income , lots of profits . America is loaded up with liabilities and we’re hemorrhaging red ink . We have huge losses . So if you think that America is more capitalist than China or China is more socialist , then you must think that socialism is a better economic system because after all , the Chinese are more successful if you want to measure it by the accumulation of assets , by the positive balance of trade . </s>
So , and I don’t think that there is a way for a country , if you remember the Soviet Union , which was a Communist country , the Soviet Union didn’t make anything , they didn’t produce anything . </s>
We constantly had to give them money so that they can feed themselves . Pretty much everything is being made in China today and the United States ; they have this enormous trade surplus . And more importantly , they’re accumulating massive savings . </s>
If you look at China , they have a savings rate of close to 50 percent . We have a savings rate , basically negative . In fact we rely in America on a Ponzi scheme called Social Security . They don’t have Social Security in China . They don’t have a lot of these big government programs that we have in the United States . </s>
Look at our monetary system . </s>
We have the Federal Reserve , price fixing , interest rates at practically zero . In all the macroeconomics and balances that we create , we micromanage our economy through our tax code . </s>
We’ve got the U.S. government subsidizing or guaranteeing of almost 100 percent of all the mortgages in the United States , so it’s not up to the free market . Credit isn’t being allocated by the market ; it’s being allocated by government . Government is deciding who should get money and who shouldn’t get money and who it should subsidize and who it should penalize . </s>
It does all of this through the tax code and through the Federal Reserve . Yes , you’ve got something similar going on in China , only in China I think it’s more above board . </s>
Yes , there is government and you know that government’s involved and maybe you have to bribe the right bureaucrat , but the same thing is going on in the United States . We’re just not as above board with it . And if you think about the partnership that government has with business in the United States , most of the laws and regulations , and I work in a highly regulated field in the securities industry , but this is the same with industries all over the United States . You have all these regulatory bodies that are created for the specific purpose of destroying competition and trying to prevent smaller firms from coming into existence or competing with these large firms that have captured all the regulatory bodies that oversee them . And that is a function of government , and it’s a combination of big business working with big government to stifle innovation and to stifle capitalism . </s>
And when you have the U.S. government taking such an enormous share of our GDP and taking such an enormous share of our output in taxation and then trying to regulate it and micromanage it from Washington D.C. , we’re not even close to being a capitalist country anymore in the United States . The unfortunate thing is that China is closer . But what’s more important is the direction in which the pendulum is swinging . In China , it’s swinging towards capitalism . Unfortunately in America , it’s swinging away . </s>
Thank you Peter Schiff . Our motion is `` China does capitalism better than America '' and our next debater is going to speak against the motion . Ian Bremmer , who’s company Eurasia Group , makes its money by helping companies figure out when investing overseas is risky or not and so being right about China is practically his business model . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Ian Bremmer . First of all , Orville said that China is a fickle mistress . And so getting China right is hard . And one thing we do all need to admit is that the level of volatility in outcomes in China over the next 10 to 20 years is vastly greater than the level of volatility in the United States or in Europe or Japan . Can China make it ? </s>
Can they fundamentally transform their economic and political system ? A country of 1.3 billion people . We know they need to it . The World Bank just made it very clear . </s>
The Chinese government admitted it themselves . Doesn’t mean they can do it , it’s never been done before . It’s a bet . I’d bet against . </s>
But it’s a bet . </s>
If you have to make a bet , you bet on the United States . </s>
Lots of people do , that’s why the U.S. still has the world’s reserve currency . I don’t know even where to start on this frankly , having just heard that China needs to bribe the right bureaucrats -- but same in the United States , we’re not as above board about that ... That’s on its face ludicrous , right ? China is a system where if you want to do well , the highest levels , 52 percent of the GDP -- 62 percent of the GDP is state-owned enterprises , absolutely there is no rule of law . </s>
There’s no transparency . </s>
You don’t have as many regulations in China as the U.S . That is true . Does that mean China does capitalism better ? No . </s>
It means that if you’re China and you want to move a village and build a road , you can . It is not clear to me that that is capitalism in its most effective or even most rapacious form . That’s the state doing what it wants to do for the state . </s>
That’s the problem . </s>
You want to talk about state intervention ? We’ve got it . We’ve got it in China . Look , it’s unfortunate to me we’re even debating this . </s>
Five years ago , we wouldn’t . </s>
It shames me . It shames me as an American because there are people out there that believe that the United States can’t do capitalism as well as China . </s>
There are countries now that are doing capitalism better than the United States . </s>
If we were having this debate about Canada , we wouldn’t have as much of a problem . We wouldn’t , right . On a lot of fronts -- I’m willing -- I’m not saying the United States is worse on everything . I’m saying that life increasingly , if you look at issues like the deficit for the U.S. , if you look at financial regulations -- I’m not going to stand behind all that . </s>
But I am going to go after China , because ultimately we have a problem . Look , the Chinese system is not just capitalist ; it’s state capitalist . State capitalism is a system where the state is the principal actor in the economy . </s>
And it uses markets ultimately for their own political gain . </s>
If it turns out that profit is useful for their political gain , they’ll go for it . If it turns out it isn’t , they’ll go against it . </s>
And that’s true whether we’re talking about Chinese firms or whether we’re talking about Western firms . </s>
I mean , Facebook’s doing a pretty good IPO , but they’re not in China . </s>
Why ? China doesn’t want Facebook in China . It’d make a lot of money . It’d make a lot of money for China . </s>
That’s not the point , right . That’s not capitalism . That’s a problem . Ultimately , when we’ve seen state capitalism work globally , it works until it fails . And it works because despite the fact that the state is massively inefficient , and I suspect Peter admits that the state is massively inefficient , and it is in lots of forms , but it can hide its inefficiency through cheap stuff . </s>
Argentina was state capitalist , looked as good as the United States in the Western hemisphere over 100 years ago until they ran out of cheap land . And then they started defaulting . </s>
Venezuela looked great on cheap oil . Not so much anymore , right . China’s looked great for 34 years on the basis of cheap labor . China will ultimately run out of cheap labor . So , what we have in China is this extraordinary car with a huge engine going very fast down a long road . </s>
And that road has been straight for 34 years , but coming up there’s a big turn in the road… . </s>
And we’ve never seen steering . Maybe -- thank you , mom -- maybe -- Maybe they have steering , but we don’t know . And the fact is that if you are China , there’s one thing you’re going to have a very hard time doing . There are no more Zhu Rongjis and Deng Xiaopings in China . </s>
You don’t have strong individual leadership . You have leadership by consensus , individuals that are moving together very incrementally . They’re very cautious . They understand the importance of the stakes they are playing for . The one thing that you will not do well is go after your own intrinsic interests . </s>
The state-owned enterprises that are providing you money -- that’s where the inefficiencies are going to be as labor gets more expensive . That’s where the inefficiency will be when the United States and other Western multinationals stop giving them technology to rip off . </s>
Another problem with Chinese state capitalism is it creates enemies , you know . </s>
There are a lot of folks around Asia . They see the Chinese economic miracle , but they’re begging the United States to maintain a presence . Why ? Because China does capitalism better than the United States ? </s>
I don’t think so . We got to watch what people do , not what people say , what they do . </s>
Did you see that piece in the Wall Street Journal , talked about the disposition of Chinese millionaires , how over 50 percent of Chinese millionaires say they prefer to live in the United States than China ? And yeah , it’s about quality of life . Yeah , it’s about the environment . Yeah , it’s about opportunities for their kids . </s>
It’s also about no rule of law in China and worrying about corruption and the sanctity of their assets over the long term . Your assets are okay tomorrow . </s>
The United States , we’re over-litigious . China doesn’t have that problem . You don’t have to worry about lawyers in China . You have to worry about someone ripping off your stuff or being forced out of the country or not being heard from again . Now , maybe Peter believes that those 50-plus percent of Chinese millionaires are stupid . </s>
Because ultimately , the United States is in decline , and so they shouldn’t be coming here , in which case , fine , but then China’s millionaires aren’t that bright . </s>
And those are the entrepreneurs , so we shouldn’t bet on them either way . You’re in a catch-22 , sir . </s>
You know , I’m interested in what the Chinese do with their money . I understand that the Chinese are saying that they don’t like the U.S. dollar as a reserve currency , but where are they putting their cash ? </s>
In the U.S. Now , Ron Paul and Peter say they shouldn’t do that , and then we’re in big trouble . Okay , well , when are they going to stop ? </s>
Because I don’t believe the Chinese are stupid . For me , that’s not an interesting analytical model . </s>
For me , what’s interesting is presuming the Chinese understand their interests and they’re putting all that money into treasuries because they believe that’s safe over the long term . We are entering an environment of fear . We’re entering an environment of volatility . When things get more volatile , we don’t just bet on go-go- growth any more . We put our money under the mattresses . </s>
Central banks do that too . And in that environment , the world’s largest economy , also ultimately the most resilient , the United States of America . Thank you very much . Thank you , Ian Bremmer . Here’s our motion : `` China does capitalism better than America.” </s>
We have heard the first two speakers , and now on to the third . I’ve lost a page here . Well , Orville Schell , I’m just going to vamp . </s>
Orville Schell is head of the Center for U.S.- China Relations at the Asian Society . You have also written something like nine books that have the word China in the title and some that don’t have China in the title . You know what you’re talking about . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Orville Schell . </s>
Well , I find myself in the awkward position , being an American , deeply believing in this country and its ability to innovate and in its entrepreneurial powers , to defend a Marxist-Leninist economy . And I beg you to marshal every bit of scrutiny you can to my argument and please convince me I am wrong by voting against me at the end of this debate . I would say that the comparison between capitalism in the United States and China is as much divided by the fact that capitalism here has in many ways failed its promise . </s>
And there , in a very counterintuitive way , one we hardly have expected , the Chinese Communist Party has managed to graft on a certain kind of guerilla mobility under Leninist rigidity to make their system actually function in a way which I think all of us would agree , over the past three decades , has been quite extraordinary -- something none of us who were standing in the middle of Tiananmen Square of 1989 when there were a million people demonstrating there , thought could ever possibly happen . So , I think if we look at America , we find a country that is in quite a bit of psychological self-doubt at this particular moment . We find a country that has had much of its government , many of its leaders besieged by irrationality , religiosity , they don’t believe in evolution , they don’t believe in climate change , we can not pass a simple measure in Congress to extend the national debt , which is not going to not happen . </s>
How can a government that is so paralyzed by its own inability to see reason , how can it be the custodian over that critical part of every economy that a government must preside over ? This is not to say that we don’t venerate entrepreneurs , we don’t venerate innovation , and we don’t believe in a free economy . But let me read you just simply what Adam Smith had to say , the great patron saint of laissez faire capitalism . </s>
He said that when the security of the whole society is at stake , natural liberty of a few individuals which might endanger that security ought to be restrained by the laws of all governments , the most free as well as the most despotical . </s>
And I think it is precisely here that we have failed . And by doing so , we have lent a greater credence to this curious , cryptic , hybrid version of Leninist capital , which China has employed , to quite a bit of success , I would have to say . </s>
So let 's quickly just look at what we see in China . I spoke of the psychological dimension of the problem in this country , and I think everybody in this room feels it . There is a sense of I think lassitude . At the same time , greed is quite a force lost in the land . </s>
There 's a great deal of self deception at work . If you look at China , who 's running the government in China now ? They 're all engineers . </s>
In many ways , the very things that we used to impute to China as a great weakness , namely , a over reliance on ideology , are now the very things that are hampering our own country , while China , governed by engineers and technocrats , tends to look at reason . There are no climate deniers in China . </s>
I have never spoken to a Chinese who doubted evolution . And yet the ranks of the American political houses of Congress are replete with these people , and they 're making decisions which govern how we live and govern the American economy . </s>
China also has managed in a way that I think it deserves our esteem to combine the public with the private and to act when things need to be done . When a stimulus program needs to be enacted , they look at the facts and they enact it . Do you remember when we looked at five-year plans as quaint kind of throwbacks to some retrograde period of Stalinist economics ? Well , I think the United States could do with a good five-year plan . We ca n't plan for three months ahead . </s>
We have no ability even to execute policy , much less long range policy . If you go to Washington , you find more and more people utterly despairing of writing policy documents . Why ? Because nobody can do anything with them . I think this ability of China to martial facts rationally , to martial its resources and make policy and allocate capital where it needs to be allocated in times of crisis is something that our own country could learn from . </s>
I want to read a quick quote from Henny Sender from the Financial Times . </s>
`` The combination of Chinese SOEs and debt from state owned banks is a powerful alliance that will increasingly resonate outside of China as well as within it . '' I think that 's an interesting statement from a paper that 's basically a laissez faire capitalist paper . So finally I would say that we would do well not to assume that China has nothing to teach the United States . It may be that this system will not endure in the future . It has many structural weaknesses . </s>
But to date I would say it has been ascending while our own form of capitalism , replete with the weaknesses that you all well know , has been in a state of decline . And whether we have the ability to grab it at the last minute from its final collapse is a question which will remain for years to come . Thank you , Orville Schell . Our motion is , `` China does capitalism better than America . '' </s>
And our final debater speaking against the motion , speaks the Chinese language better than anyone on this stage , he has the advantage of having been born there , but he has been living here for decades , a professor of government at Claremont McKenna , the titles of his books and articles on China 's future use phrases like , `` China 's Trapped Transition , ” “Looming Stagnation , '' so we do n't need to ask what he really thinks . But here 's more of what he does think . Ladies and gentlemen , Minxin Pei . I 'm not going to speak in Chinese . </s>
I think that the impression that China is doing capitalism better than the U.S. is understandable . That 's because it 's a very superficial impression . One reason why that impression is widespread is that China has been growing fast . But there 's a reason China is growing fast . </s>
Low income countries tend to grow much faster than rich countries because they have much bigger growth potential . Just think of two things . </s>
Consumption of energy . Chinese consumption of energy is about one-fourth of the U.S. consumption . So the Chinese , if they consume more energy , they will grow a lot faster . </s>
The same with steel production . China consumes one-tenth of the steel that the average American consumes . </s>
So if they want to reach American consumption , they need to build a lot of steel plants , and that makes economic growth . So first of all , do not judge whether a country does capitalism better or worse by just looking at its growth numbers . Second is that when you compare the two countries , the U.S. and China , you have to look at facts . </s>
This presentation is nothing but man the facts . So what are the facts ? If you look at corporate profits , U.S. companies are far more profitable than Chinese companies . And that is to think that we can trust Chinese accounting . </s>
And then you look at tax collection . I have to disagree with Peter . </s>
He says the Chinese , they collect less taxes than U.S . The opposite is true . The U.S. government takes about federal/state , about 30 percent of GDP . The Chinese government collects 35 percent . </s>
But that’s not the end of the story . </s>
Because in the U.S. , you actually get something back from the government in the form of Social Security , health care , Medicare , Medicaid . In China , you get very little back because the bulk of government taxes are spent on government consumption , administration . </s>
If you go to China and get treated to a 20-course meal , you think great , that’s Chinese hospitality . But don’t forget , it’s being paid for by Chinese taxpayers . Not in the USA . </s>
You do not get that kind of treatment when you go to Washington , D.C . And then you look at whether China’s growth is using less natural resources . </s>
And here the U.S. is three times more efficient as China . Because for every dollar of GDP produced in China , China has to consume three times more in terms of its natural resources , water , clean air , land . The U.S. in other words , is a lot more efficient . Then you look at international comparisons , and here we’re using third-party numbers . And here , China does not look nearly as good as the U.S . Corruption . </s>
There’s a NGO based in Berlin called Transparency International . It publishes every year , a global index called Corruption Perception index . This index , the U.S. is ranked 24th in terms of , as the least corrupt country in the world . </s>
China is ranked 75 . So if you think our average politician in Washington is corrupt , wait until you meet a Chinese politician . Then you look at overall economic competitiveness because capitalism is known for its efficiency and competitiveness . Here , the U.S. is ranked not number one , number five . What about China ? </s>
China is number 26 . So way , way behind the U.S. Then you look at something like innovation ranking . The U.S. is number seven ; China is 29 . You look at ease of doing business . This is by the World Bank . </s>
Because , a real capitalist country should be one in which it is very easy to do business . Overall ranking for the U.S. is number four in the world . China is number 91 . </s>
Then starting a business , U.S. is number 13 ; China is number 151 . Getting credit , the U.S. is number four ; China is number 67 . The list goes on and on and I don’t want to bore you . Finally , I want to imagine , what will the politburo members think about this debate ? If for some reason , they’ve learned that in New York City , they’re debating whether China does capitalism better than the U.S . I think their first reaction is not to laugh . </s>
Then the second reaction , they say the Americans are really easy to impress . </s>
You stage an Olympics . They think China is number one . You build the world’s largest high-speed rail at enormous cost . They think the U.S. is falling behind . </s>
Then you lend the Americans $ 2 trillion . They think , China is definitely number one . </s>
So , the third thought that would come to their mind is that the Americans have very short memories , because when Sputnik was launched , everybody thought the Soviet Union was to dominate the world . And then in the late 1980s , I think in this city , people should have good memories about who was buying the Rockefeller Center , right . Japan was dominating the headlines . Everybody thought Japan was doing capitalism better than the U.S. Now , look at where Japan is after 20 years . </s>
So , I think what we’re seeing here is not that China does capitalism better than the U.S. ; we are experiencing a period of self-doubt . I’m sure the real issue is not about China . </s>
The real issue is about the U.S . The U.S. can do capitalism much better than it does , but China , at least for the moment and for the foreseeable future , will not be doing capitalism anywhere better , anywhere close to the U.S. in terms of competition , efficiency , even social justice . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Minxin Pei . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . When we return , the debaters go head-to-head in round two . We’ll be right back . </s>
And now we are right back . We’re just going to have these lecterns removed , and then I’m going to raise my hand for a round of applause . And imagine commercials are playing somewhere . </s>
Okay , let’s start again . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Now , on to round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . This is where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from the audience and from me . We have here two teams of two who are arguing out this motion : `` China does capitalism better than America.” We’ve heard the team arguing in support of the motion , Peter Schiff and Orville Schell , basically saying that China does capitalism better because there’s actually more freedom to do things that involved capitalism , that there are fewer regulations , that there are lower taxes . </s>
It is not pure capitalism and they’re not arguing that , but they’re saying that it’s more pure than the U.S. has had in the last 100 years . China’s amazing growth rate really seals the argument for them , but they also make the point that possibly an economy operating under the apparatus of what we call a democracy in this country has its downside . And they suggest that maybe a little planning is not such a bad thing . </s>
The team arguing against the motion , Ian Bremmer and Minxin Pei . They’re making the argument that what China’s doing , even if it could be called capitalism , is something that’s probably cruising for a crash , that when the government is the biggest player in the market , as they argue that it is , point out that it is , this tends to lead to corruption and to cronyism and ultimately to exposure of the lack of real innovation . They basically are also making something of a hare and hedgehog argument and pointing out that China is the hare and it’s in a good dash right now , but that the U.S. is the hedgehog , plodding along steadily and more reliably . So , I want to take a question from this side’s argument to that side , and that’s that argument that what we’re seeing from China , this enormous growth rate , your opponents have pointed out , number one , is the result of China coming off a much lower baseline . </s>
And when things get really volatile , things can really fall apart there . And they’re essentially saying that what’s happening in China over the long haul is a blip . Is it a blip ? Peter Schiff . </s>
Well , first of all , there are a lot of countries that are starting on low baselines that are not having any kind of economic growth at all . So , the difference is you do have more capitalism now in China , and it’s that freedom , it’s that -- those market forces that are responsible for the growth , not that because they’re poor , because there were plenty of people that were poor and that didn’t grow at all . As far as whether the trajectory is sustainable , I think not only is it just sustainable , but I think it’s going to get better because the real country that’s headed for a crisis is America . And I think what’s dragging the Chinese down is their currency peg . They’re loaning America all this money , so American can keep buying the products that Americans really can’t afford . </s>
And so , as a result , the Chinese are debasing their currency and they’re creating a lot of inflation , which is destabilizing their economy and , I think , undermining the standard of living of their own citizens , which would be rising even faster if the Chinese government simply let the RMB rise in value , let the dollar tank . </s>
If the Chinese government didn’t take so much of the Chinese production and just loan it to America so that it could be squandered on big government and consumption , but I think eventually -- </s>
So , if that is so unwise by the Chinese government , is this a blip period for them then ? Well , I think they’re going to figure this out , and they’re not going to play this game anymore . And the real crash is coming here , because then interest rates skyrocket , the dollar tanks , consumer prices go through the roof , and we have our Greek moment , only there’s no Europe to bail us out . Ian Bremmer , do you want to respond ? </s>
Well , yeah . </s>
We’re not heading for a Greek moment . I mean , comparing us with Greece is almost as ludicrous as comparing us to China . Yeah , it’s not fair to the Greeks . I don’t think you even believe that . </s>
But leave it aside . Look , I mean -- You’ve got to read my book . No , I’ll get there . </s>
I’ll get there . Look , the United States has so many strong intrinsic advantages in terms of not just the matter of where the dollar sits but also , I mean , 30 percent of the world’s calories comes from the United States . </s>
People are increasingly fighting over food . That’s a real problem for China . The environment in China is absolutely falling apart . If you look at environment-adjusted GDP , it’s so much worse than the growth you see presently . We already heard from Minxin about just how much more profitable American multinationals are than Chinese SOEs , and yet that China is moving more in the direction towards SOEs , not towards private sectors , especially since 2008 . </s>
All of these things are problematic , and the ability of the Chinese to suddenly make a decision to go away from the dollar , you have to go into something . What exactly are you going into ? You’re going into the euro in an enormous way . I don’t see that in terms of massive growth opportunities . You’re going into Japan ? We already said we had two lost decades there . </s>
You’re going to go into gold or hard commodities ? You can do some of that . You can only do so much . And as you go away from the dollar , you of course ruin the position that you have in the rest of those dollars . </s>
So China’s not going to do that . They haven’t , and they’re not going to . Orville Schell . Let’s bring you into the debate . </s>
You know , this isn’t exclusively about one country or another . We’re doing a comparison here , and we’re talking about recent history , not an idealized America . </s>
And we’d be very foolish to idealize China . And I think what we have to reckon with is the chances of each country finding a new state of equipoise , the United States included . </s>
It is not a foregone conclusion that we’re going to pull this thing out of the water . I think if this country can not grasp reason again , it doesn’t matter how good or bad China will be , China may have an unfair advantage . I think what’s going on in Washington right now is so utterly mad and broken that I put no confidence whatsoever in their ability to play that central role that every government , and I may disagree with you here , Peter , but every government must play . And we are not playing it . And Orville Schell , you , in making that point before , you went on to say that you think that the model of planning , which we used to think was quaint and slightly ridiculous , maybe we should be looking at in a new light now . </s>
Minxin Pei , what about that ? </s>
Is a little planning a good thing after all , or a lot of planning ? </s>
Well , in China , they plan a lot , except they do nothing about the plans they draw up . </s>
Because if you look at Chinese five-year plans , you think , my gosh , these guys are very strategic . And then , five years later , and you do some kind of plan accounting and you see what has been accomplished -- very little , because if they have actually followed through on their promises , China today would indeed be doing capitalism a lot better than the U.S . Peter Schiff . Well , you know -- </s>
Or do you want to respond to that point ? </s>
Not that particular point , but there’s some other points that he made earlier that I’d -- All right . </s>
Tell us what the point was and go for it . </s>
Well , first of all , one of the things that you mentioned , you said that American citizens , we get all kinds of benefits from our government that the Chinese citizens don’t get . Well , I would say that we get a lot more liability . </s>
If you try to figure out what each American share is of the national debt , it is enormous . And what the government is giving the American people is debt . I would much rather -- and if you’re talking about capitalism , you’re defending capitalism by saying we get Social Security , what’s capitalistic about essentially planned retirement that’s financed like Bernie Madoff ran his investment business . I think it’s much better that the Chinese are free to keep their income and plan for their retirement . </s>
Minxin Pei , take on the question of whether the existence of Social Security compromises the U.S. claim to be capitalist , which I think is Peter’s point . I don’t think so , because capitalism produces efficiency , but it also has a lot of risks . Modern capitalist societies are a lot riskier than traditional agrarian societies because in a modern capitalist society , once you lose your job , you really have no source of income . You can not grow your own potatoes . Let me just say something about China . </s>
The debt we know about -- because Peter says that in the U.S. , you -- every citizen gets a lot of -- is responsible for a lot of government debt . The same thing is true of China , because the Chinese national debt is actually higher than the American debt . In China -- What are you talking about ? Okay . </s>
In China , the nominal debt is low , 20 percent , but the Chinese government knows better than Bernie Madoff , okay , does a much better job in hiding its liabilities . </s>
It would -- We owe them over $ 2 trillion . </s>
No , two trillion dollars is not -- is foreign exchange reserve and I -- Well , that 's three trillion , if you want -- No , no , that 's three trillion . Are you saying that liabilities exceed that ? Oh , the Chinese liability is about 80 percent of GDP . </s>
The U.S. public health debt is about 60 to 65 percent . The trouble with the Chinese people is that after paying taxes , having their government incur so much debt , they get no Social Security , they get no social protection , so that 's why I think even capitalists are coming to this country , to enjoy some kind of protection . Well , certainly -- Let 's Orville Schell -- </s>
Wait a minute . China is implementing -- trying to implement a health care system , a Social Security system , and when you say the Chinese people have gotten nothing out of the last 30 years of development , you have surely seen the infrastructure that China has built , which benefits everybody in some way or other . Orville , take 10 , 15 seconds to describe specifically the kind of infrastructure you 're talking about , housing , roads -- Well , you look at the highway system , you look at the rails system , we have n't built a tunnel in New York City since the 1920s and the 1930s . China 's throwing these things up overnight , bridges , subway systems , you name it . </s>
Now , I do n't want to idealize China 's system , but I do want to give credit where credit is due , and it is unfair to say that no benefit is derived from the amazing development of the last 30 years . Does this side concede that point ? No , I do n't concede that point at all . Ian Bremmer , do you want to come in on this ? </s>
I would n't say that -- to say that Chinese get nothing of course is ludicrous . That 's like comparing the United States to Greece . We do n't want to do that , right ? Clearly Chinese citizens are doing better on average than they were before . </s>
There 's no question , although if you ask where a lot of the profitability from that development has gone , it 's gone to the United States . I mean , you look at Apple , you look at the manufacturing of the iPad , $ 9 , $ 10 is captured by China , about 60 goes back to Apple and its shareholders , most of whom are American . I like that trade , right ? I mean , there 's a reason why American multinationals actually do better , but we have a problem in the United States with an increasingly large percentage of Americans , right , a book that I think you probably have read by Charles Murray , `` Coming Apart , '' increasingly , they 're not doing as well . </s>
They do n't have as much opportunity . We have to address that because if not , long term those folks are going to get upset . But they 're not going to be as upset as the hundreds of millions of Chinese that will eventually face a crash and will have no opportunity , no option to really revolt against -- </s>
Peter Schiff . You talk about the profits of the U.S. corporations , we 'll see how real those profits are when interest rates go up and they 're facing an entirely different environment . But you keep talking about living in America , yes , I 'm not saying that it 's not better to live in America . </s>
We still live pretty good because we 're able to borrow all this money . </s>
We have a phony economy that is perpetuated based on debt . </s>
When this debt bubble bursts and this whole thing comes toppling down , it 's going to be a whole different story . I do n't doubt that people would want to live in America , given our lifestyle . But that 's going to change . You 're not looking at what 's keeping it going . You 're not looking at all this debt . </s>
And you 're saying , `` Well , the Chinese are going to throw good amount of money after bad forever because they have no choice . '' They do have a choice . The more good money they throw after bad , the more money they 're going to lose , and the Chinese are figuring this out . The Chinese are throwing good money after bad and not just in the United States ; they 're doing it in China , too . They 're building infrastructure , more and more infrastructure that Chinese people ca n't use but they have to keep the growth going . </s>
It 's better than buying treasuries . </s>
-- comparatively horrific . </s>
I mean , I do n't know , we can have a long debate about that . I would prefer they did neither and just let their citizens keep their money . Okay , but that -- -- unsustainable U.S. -- Second point , if you want to talk about Chinese profitability compared to American , look at the few -- the dozens of firms in China that are supposed to be some of the best in breed that have wanted to come to the United States to list . </s>
And they list , and they -- and we get inside the books , and we realize they 're completely cooked , and they get in massive trouble . And even you know sort of billionaire brilliant folks like John Paulson , who figured out the big -- -- absolutely lose lots of money on that . But yet we do not have -- these companies are not anywhere near as sustainable or profitable as the Chinese government makes them out to be , and that is a fundamental structural problem . </s>
Orville Schell . Well , the real question is sustainability of our own enterprise . Ian , you 've just written a wonderful book called , `` Every Nation for Itself , '' and I thought it very interesting to read the following . </s>
You talk about the serious psychological toll in this country of the financial crisis and the near economic collapse . And you say , worse still is the fear that America’s leaders can’t fix these problems because the U.S. political system is broken beyond repair . </s>
Is it ? No , that’s the fear that they believe that . And you don’t , you believe that we will regain our sense and be able to restore reason to our decision making and pull out of this nadir of -- </s>
I thought it was interesting that you brought up the fact that the United States government is trying to get this 1.2 , 1.4 trillion in reductions passed . The Democrats and Republicans had a basic agreement about it , some of it was Iraq , some Afghanistan , some was going to be increased airline fees , some was going to be reductions in agriculture subsidies that was fairly easy to do . And then at the last minute , they decided not to do it . But in part the reason they decided not to do it is because they’re not being pressured . </s>
In Europe -- one second -- I know you’re excited . </s>
In Europe they are being pressured and they’re finally acting . And it got really ugly before it had to happen . </s>
The unfortunate lesson that we are all learning since 2008 , the world is getting faster . Governments are not getting faster . And that’s true in the United States . </s>
We’re kicking the can . </s>
That’s true in Europe ; they’ve done a lot of kicking the can . Japan . But the largest can getting kicked hardest down the road is the Chinese can , and that’s by far the one I’d be most worried about . Peter Schiff . </s>
Well , if you , first looking at your discussions about debt . We didn’t have any serious discussions . </s>
That trillion dollars in cuts was an illusion . </s>
It was spread out over 10 years , so it’s 100 billion a year in almost a $ 4 trillion budget and it was simply reductions in the proposed rate of increases . So we weren’t even talking about dealing with the problem . </s>
But you are right , we don’t have to deal with it because both the Federal Reserve continues to print dollars and buy treasuries and the Chinese central bank and foreign central banks continue to print their own currencies and buy dollars and buy treasuries . So we are the ones that are literally living on borrowed time . You’ve got to think , what’s going to happen in America when like Europe , we are forced to deal with the enormity of the consequences . If you look at our federal debt , which is the funded portion , is financed like a sub-prime mortgage with a teaser rate . How is the U.S. government going to handle 5 or 10 percent interest rates on this national debt ? </s>
How is the banking system in America going to handle it when all their assets are imploding , their long-term government bonds and mortgages that they have on their books and they can’t get cheap money anymore from the Fed . What happens to our housing market ? Minxin Pei . There’s a lot of pessimism about the U.S. on this side . That’s a fair way to argue this , because this is a two part argument , China up and U.S. down . </s>
So they’re more heavily I would say on U.S. down than China up . You guys are -- Well , people inside China are not very optimistic either about the country’s future prospects . The high growth period for China is over . I urge you to read the World Bank’s latest report on China called China 2030 . </s>
It’s free for downloading on the World Bank’s website . This is what it says . From now on until 2030 , if China does well , its average growth will be somewhere between 6 and 7 percent . </s>
And if China does not do the set of reforms the World Bank recommended , probably China can not even achieve a much reduced level of growth because China is coming into an era where savings will be a lot lower . The population will be a lot older . The environmental costs will be a lot more visible if you -- I’m sure a lot of you have been to Beijing . In the future when you’re in Beijing , you should bring along a space suit . </s>
What is the message that’s getting out to the developing world ? Who do they want to be more ? Do they , do developing countries want to be us or do they want to be China ? I’ll put that to either side who wants to take it . Orville Schell , why don’t you take it ? </s>
Well , I think it’s interesting , it’s still , the United States has tremendous luster . </s>
I mean it is a great dream machine and we have a great country and many Chinese would like to live here . But what is interesting in the last few years is the number of Chinese who’ve gone home . And they’ve gone home because they see opportunity . </s>
They feel -- anyone who’s been to China lately feels an amazing sense of energy . And I would have to say that these great American virtues of get it done , whatever it takes , can do , I feel , and I’m surprised , more and more , have been incarnate in China and less and less in America . Ian Bremmer , same question . Yeah , I don’t think that China has that kind of luster internationally . </s>
And it’s part because the Chinese system is really one that is focused on China , period . </s>
One of the major problems China has is that for them to build the state capital system , they have to support China and the Chinese market . Where the system that the United States supports is really one of having as much access to global competition in markets as possible . </s>
And ultimately , that’s a much more efficient system . The United States corporations benefit from it . </s>
We’re the ones who are pushing the WTO . </s>
We’re the ones who have been pushing the Doha around . When that doesn’t work , we go for the TransPacific Partnership , the TPP . We want broader markets . The Chinese are saying no . </s>
For 4G , we want a Chinese standard . Now , I understand that they’d rather have a Chinese standard than an American standard , but the point is that the Chinese are saying we want a Chinese standard as opposed to a global standard . That -- other countries don’t like that . They want more efficiency , and from that perspective , the Chinese incursion into the global free market -- my last book was called “The End of the Free Market” not because I thought the United States wasn’t going to have a free market anymore but because I thought that the rise of China as the world’s second largest economy eroded what had been global free markets and competition and actually poses an enormous problem for third-party countries . </s>
As China gets larger , that challenge grows . And so , not only the domestic challenges , but they will have greater international challenges . </s>
I want to go to audience questions now . And what will happen is if you raise your hand , I’ll point to you . If you can stand up , tell us who you are , and a microphone will come to you . </s>
Hold the microphone about this distance away from your mouth so that the radio broadcast can hear you quite clearly . And I really urge you to keep this on topic , to look at what the motion is , to figure out whether your question actually gets these guys talking about something that focuses on the motion itself . </s>
And I just need to say this for radio : We are in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I’m John Donvan . </s>
We have two teams of two debating this motion : `` China does capitalism better than America.” Questions from the audience . In the front row . I just want to say if you’re sitting in shadow and if you can’t see the numbers on your wristwatch , I can’t see you . So , if you want to ask a question , if you could step forward down the stairs and I’ll try to call on you from there . </s>
Sir ? I’m Norbert Swisslocki . I lived in China for five years . The Chinese workers are known for their hard work . This is a question on labor . </s>
To what extent does the labor market in China fuel Chinese economy whereas the labor market in the United States seems too thwart it ? Minxin Pei , why don’t you take that first . Then we’ll come to -- Okay , the labor market in China is still not as free as it appears to be . What China has done in terms of making its growth faster is to move a lot of labor from agriculture into the cities . </s>
The moment that happens , automatically , they produce a lot more because that’s urban areas , their jobs actually pay them more . So that’s one . But in terms of labor mobility , rural migrants in China still suffer a lot of discrimination , because if they move to cities , I’m sure some of your workers have experienced -- they do not enjoy the benefits of urban residence . For example , they have to stand there ; they can not enroll their kids in public schools . They have to send them to substandard private schools . </s>
And they do not enjoy any retirement pension protection . That’s available only for state workers . Minxin , how is that statement ammunition for you on this motion ? </s>
For the motion , which is that if you look at the labor market , per se , you would say China’s labor market is not as free , as well developed , or even regulated than the U.S . </s>
Peter Schiff ? I would argue that our labor market is hardly a bastion of freedom either . I mean , first of all , we have a minimum wage law that effectively makes it illegal to hire a pretty sizable chunk of our population that can’t get a job . </s>
But even for the Americans who are employed , you have the government dictating to employers all sorts of criteria upon which they have to base their decisions on who to hire and who to promote , and there’re all sorts of mandates that , as an employer , you are required . You have to do this , you have to do that , at often great expense to yourself . </s>
So , I don’t think you have a lot of freedom in the U.S. labor markets . </s>
There are so many different ways you can be sued as an employer in this country that a lot of people do what they can to avoid hiring people because they don’t want to get within the crosshairs of the government or the legal system that has sprung as a result of all these mandates . So , I would think that if you’re an employer in China and you’re hiring people , I don’t think that you have to worry about that as much as an employer in America , that you’re going to be sued by your employee because you , you know , you passed them over for a promotion or maybe you didn’t hire somebody and they want to sue you and claim it’s because you’re , you know , you’re handicapped or you’re a different race . I think you have more freedom there . </s>
And to try to -- you know , I mean , I don’t even want to hold up -- And to nail it to the motion , you’re saying , though , that those conditions make it a better form of -- a more efficient form of capitalism . Well , I think the fewer rules that you have -- I think labor , employees and employers should be free to negotiate with one another over the terms of their employment without any interference whatsoever from government . Right in the center , sir , very center . And no -- yeah -- the person who was standing should continue to stand and wait for a microphone . </s>
Thank you very much . My question is for the panelists in favor of the motion . While you’re arguing the same conclusion , it seems to me that your premises are at odds with each other if I understand them correctly . </s>
On the one hand , Mr. Schell seems to say that for America to do capitalism better we need more top-down planning by government presumably , while Mr. Schiff if arguing that we need much less of that and more undirected bottom-up economy . Could you reconcile the drivers behind your conclusions ? I want to see this . The complex answer to your question is no . </s>
Yeah , I guess it would be a debate within a debate , but -- But yeah , I mean , I don’t think the solution is for America to become less free and to try to emulate what China does wrong , but to pick up on what China’s doing right . And I think China needs to do the same thing , not follow the poor example of modern America and all the things that we’ve done to wreck our capitalist economy but to turn back the clock and to try to incorporate the system and the values that were enshrined in the Constitution by the framers . I think that is real capitalism . </s>
You know what’s interesting ? I’m -- I like to sort of have a gender balance . </s>
I don’t see a single woman raising her hand anywhere . And I -- am I wrong ? </s>
Shout out . Thank you , I heard that . I do see , right down in front . </s>
Hi , my name is McKenna Webster . I was curious that no one mentioned human rights once this evening . And I’m wondering if you think that that plays a role in a debate on capitalism ? Orville Schell . You know , I think the United States has , over the last decade , been not exactly exemplary as an evangelist for human rights , which has stilled our voice to some degree . </s>
This is an aspect of the Chinese system which is not exemplary . </s>
And we don’t need to and wouldn’t want to imitate it . But having said that , I think we have to be honest that authoritarian capitalism has been able to do things that a freer form of capitalism sometimes fails to be able to do . </s>
Ian Bremmer . I mean , God forbid you’re forced to hire disabled people , right . Yes . </s>
But we can’t compare human rights in the United States with China , obviously . The U.S. still makes -- does a lot of things wrong . </s>
That’s like this broader debate . The U.S. does a lot of things wrong on capitalism but still vastly more effective than China . The U.S. has a lot of problems in human rights , but China isn’t in the same league , right , not on the same league sheets . Let’s be very clear . And while I think that a certain level of human rights abuses facilitates rapacious capitalism , especially in the short term , in the long term , it will bite you in the hiney . </s>
And there are other places that you get problems , too . I did talk about transparency and the fact that places like Facebook and Google and Twitter are a problem for China because they want to own that data . </s>
They want to control it . They want to shape it . </s>
They want Chinese state Internet just like they have state capitalism . </s>
That’s a problem for them . When I think about responses in terms of general transparency , in the United States you do actually know largely what your officials are up to . </s>
Solyndra was a disaster . It was a bad thing for the United States . Peter and I will agree on that . But we found out about it . And we found -- on balance , people got egg on their faces . </s>
In China , they don’t want to tell you about Solyndra . </s>
You don’t have media that’s getting inside the dirty laundry of serious Chinese officials . They are engineers that run the country . They are also billionaires . Let’s remember that , okay . </s>
And that’s the problem of the lack of human rights and transparency in China . It doesn’t facilitate creative destruction . It doesn’t facilitate allowing the Chinese people to take advantage of a free market . Maybe the Chinese people would be just as good capitalists as we are , but unfortunately , their system doesn’t allow it to be . </s>
And that’s a problem . Peter Schiff . </s>
If you’re going to get into the argument that if a government can require or dictate to a private employer and say , “You have to hire somebody with a disability , ” that doesn’t create rights , that diminishes individual rights . </s>
What you 're doing is you 're creating a special privilege for one particular protected class . And when you do that , you diminish freedom , and you diminish liberty in the country , but apart from that , you create all sorts of problems for the businesses because now the businesses have to spend all sorts of money to protect themselves against lawsuits . And in many cases , people that would have tried to bend over backwards to hire the disabled , now they wo n't touch them because they 're too afraid of getting sued . To the question as it was put , then , does human rights have any relevance to this debate about capitalism , you 're saying , yes , it does , it gets in the way of capitalism . Well , I mean , if you 're -- are you differentiating -- no -- are you differentiating human rights from individual rights ? </s>
I mean , I believe in individual freedom and I believe in rights , and it certainly is part of the discussion . </s>
And the question is where do you have more individual freedom or individual liberty ? Do you have more right now in China or do you have more in the United States ? And my argument earlier is that the typical person in China is going to surrender less of his economic output to his government in the form of taxation , and I do n't think his day-to-day life is going to be as impacted as heavily as they are in America as far as regulations . </s>
But , we have -- as far as trial , there are political prisoners in the United States , too , it 's not just in China , I mean , my father 's in prison for politics I believe , in this country . There 's a gentleman wearing a -- I believe a green necktie . Everybody is going like this now . Yes , sir . </s>
Barry Belgeride -- I just need to get the microphone to you . Thank you . </s>
Barry Belgeride , considering that our government owes 100 percent of GDP , spends 40 percent of GDP , just took over one-seventh of the economy in the face of health care , owns a big part of our biggest heavy equipment manufacturing , which is Detroit , and regulates very heavily the financial industry , do we truly have capitalism in this country ? Well , I already said we do n't . I mean , we 're not even close to having capitalism . We have -- if I was trying to figure out a word that described it , it 's fascism is really what we have . </s>
And those of you who are -- do n't understand what it is , it 's not fascism like Hitler or Mussolini , but it 's the economic system . It 's a socialist system where the government takes over the means of production through taxation and regulation . And that 's what we have . I mean , any business , I own my business but the U.S. government makes a lot more money from my business than I do . I mean , it 's not even close . </s>
The amount of money I earn running my business is tiny in comparison to the taxes the government collects from my business . So the government has effectively nationalized my business and -- </s>
Peter , may I respectfully say that the subject of our discussion -- Orville Schell . Your teammate , Orville Schell , is speaking . -- is really not this . What we 're really discussing is which economy does marketization best . </s>
Okay . Well , Ian Bremmer decided to just let all of that happen -- Yeah . -- and now responding , Minxin Pei . </s>
Well , I 'll say , to use debt as a measure of capitalism is not right because private companies can borrow 200 percent of their equity and still be private . </s>
I think the best measure of whether a country is capitalist is to look at the contribution to GDP from state-owned companies . </s>
And here the U.S. can not even compare . In China state- owned companies contribute 40 percent to GDP . In the U.S. , I do n't know about GM -- the U.S. is getting out of GM , incidentally . </s>
Now , probably little less than 1 percent . </s>
So rest assured , we are still very capitalist . Well , you ca n't compare though government debt to corporate debt . If a corporation borrows , it does so to increase its productivity . </s>
It 's acquiring income generating assets that enable it to service that debt and retire the debt , so that 's productive debt . When you 're talking about the federal debt , you 're talking about money that has been borrowed and spent on consumption on government . No , we are -- </s>
And there 's no means of repaying it . </s>
You 're looking at -- The federal government is not the consumer . It is a producer of public goods . </s>
It does n't produce . It 's a giant consumer . Of course . </s>
What is it producing ? Look , when your company goes abroad and invests , where is the security it gets ? -- security services it gets from ? </s>
I think the Pentagon for one thing actually does something in return for the U.S. people . Orville Schell , do you want to butt in this before we move on ? No . Another question , sir . </s>
Hi , my name is Guy Wiggins . I just wanted to hear from the panel their thoughts on how the one-child policy has affected capitalism in China and what the future means when you have far more men than women , and how that 's going to basically I think lead to all kinds of irrational inefficiencies in the market . I wondered how you were going to turn that to the motion . That was very good . That was very good . </s>
Orville Schell . Here I would say the advantage is emphatically on the American side because we have immigration . China does not and China has one of the most rapidly aging populations . </s>
And the lower reaches are not being replenished with the one-child policy , so it’s going to have a huge burden of taking care of elderly people and not have younger people coming in on the bottom to support them . That’s going to be a giant problem . I agree with Orville , not surprisingly . And furthermore , it also leads China to export not just capital when they try to extract commodities for example in sub-Saharan Africa , but also labor because they need to do something with those men . </s>
That’s a problem for African countries that want to have employment in addition to Chinese cash . And eventually it leads to a backlash . Again , Chinese state capitalism is a problem not just because of domestic inefficiencies but because of the backlash it creates globally . That’s one we haven’t started to experience yet because China isn’t big enough yet . </s>
But as it gets bigger , it’s going to get squeezed . I think a lot of that is going to be taken care of liberalized immigration . I think women are going to come into China , particularly when the Chinese standard of living is allowed to rise based on a stronger RMB and when the Chinese no longer have to devote such massive resources to propping up the U.S. economy and their own economy is that much more prosperous , I think you’re going to see more immigrants coming into China . </s>
Can you , just because you used the term to our radio audience , RMB . The currency , the Chinese RNB , the yuan . </s>
Ma’am . Fourth row . I want to ask -- Can you start again , thanks . </s>
Before we get into the debate , how do we define capitalism , we talk about it , elements of -- Ma’am , can you , we missed a little bit of the beginning . And just for the broadcast , we need also . I’m going to stop talking in a second and then if you can start . Thanks , go ahead . </s>
I want to ask each panel how you define capitalism . </s>
You talk about , I think different elements that contribute to capitalism or obviously America does something better and China does something better . If you keep comparing one to one , we never get to a conclusion . </s>
How do you -- China does five things better than America , America does five other things better . How do you define which one . Okay rather than go one , two , three , four , I just want to let each side pick somebody to answer that question , assuming you agree with each other . Peter Schiff , do you take a side , or take a side for ? </s>
Well , I mean , capitalism to me is where the means of production are controlled completely privately . Where the factors of production , production , land , labor and capital are allocated through a market where prices for all goods and services , wages , interest rates , are set by the market . </s>
As opposed to a centrally planned or Socialist economy where a lot of these decisions are made by bureaucrats and where the means of production is being micro-managed from a centrally planned authority . Where they’re making decisions based on politics , this should be produced ; that should be produced ; this should be favored , that should be favored . And whether the government does it directly , like a Communist would , by nationalizing the means of production and actually owning them , or rather it takes a different route by controlling them through the tax code , through what it taxes and what it subsidies . </s>
And how it regulates and what businesses it favors and what it punishes . When you start doing that , you don’t have capitalism , you have something else . So by that definition , neither China nor the United States is capitalist . Well that’s what I started . </s>
I said the question should be , which question does it worse ? Not which one does it better . </s>
Minxin Pei . Well , I can not have said it better . I think that’s the best description of the Chinese economic system . </s>
The part about what capitalism is not . But I would add one more thing . I think modern capitalism also has a legal system . </s>
The rule of law . Without the rule of law , there can be no capitalism . And China does not have rule of law . </s>
I’ll just let the mic come to you . And name please . Dan O'Connor : Yeah , my name is Dan O’Connor , I’m running for U.S. Congress here in New York City as a Democrat . One hundred thousand Chinese people in my district . I lived in China for six years and I think in order to engage in this debate , we should define the term capitalism . </s>
I think Peter did define that term . I do think you’re all very erudite in your -- and very articulate in comparing the two systems . </s>
But I think in terms of capitalism , Peter did define that . </s>
But also , I don’t think it’s fair to use World Bank figures because they’re not on the ground . Sir , I need you to get to a question . Dan O'Connor : Okay . Actually , I guess to get right to the question . I’d like to hear a definition of capitalism from everyone . </s>
Okay , we just did that . I think we -- we’ll move on then . </s>
Right here sir . </s>
Wait -- hubbub down . Thank you . Joseph Conzelman . My question is as China , like other low and mid-income countries , moves up the value chain , it’s going to eventually have to start to turn ideas into products instead of just assembling products . </s>
How do you expect that to occur in China , given the current status of intellectual property rights and in other related terms like that where it’s just very hard to create ideas and own them in China ? Orville Schell . </s>
This is a huge problem for China . </s>
And China is creating intellectual property , and as it does , I think it’s going to bring itself to heel . One hopes it will , and it simply must or it can’t be a world player . But China must move up the value chain , because the labor is getting more expensive . They’re just lower down than we are . America doesn’t do much manufacturing anymore , not as much as it used to . </s>
It’s had to move up the value chain into knowledge and information technology . That’s China’s challenge too . I think the question did its work for you . Do you -- do you want to comment on that . </s>
No , I think that it’s absolutely a problem , and I guess I would say that I’m more skeptical than Orville they’re going to be able to do it . I see the problem as you do , in part because the educational system doesn’t support it . They create a lot of engineers , but they don’t create a lot of entrepreneurs and a lot of innovators because they’re still teaching by rote as opposed to teaching students to actually question , you know , sort of what’s behind . And there’s a reason why so many folks that create things in the United States are college dropouts or , you know , sort of came from these kind of unusual background systems . </s>
They really want to know not just what four times four is but also why it works that way . That doesn’t work well within authoritarian system . Again , human rights are a part of that . </s>
Transparency is a part of it . I think when you look at the U.S. system , you have to put it all together . It works in part and it’s resilient in part because it’s so integrated , the political and the economic together . You can’t take the politics out of the Chinese economic system . If you could , they’d be doing much better right now and they’d have a longer term trajectory that I’d be much more supportive of . </s>
What we’re debating at this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate , China does capitalism better than America . I’m John Donvan , your moderator . We have four debaters , two teams of two debating this motion . And we’re taking questions from the audience . </s>
Thanks . </s>
I’m Peter Goodman with the Huffington Post and former Shanghai bureau chief with the Washington Post . I want to get your thoughts on how the growth slowdown plays out in China . </s>
Does that cause the state to double down on the state-owned sector and hang onto control of the state-owned enterprises , or does it tend toward more liberalization in an attempt to get a little bit more vibrance out of the private sector ? Are you putting your question to either side ? Anybody who’s game . I’d particularly like to hear Ian Brenner and Minxin Pei and Orville , but anybody who wants to jump in . Okay . </s>
Minxin Pei . </s>
As the World Bank’s prognosis shows that the slowdown is coming no matter what . The debate is when it’s going to happen and the speed at which the slowdown is going to happen . </s>
What the Chinese government is going to respond -- there are two paths . One is to double-down and to do the things they’ve been doing , that is a lot of investment in infrastructure that’s going to yield increasing returns and growth will continue to slow . And that will be a dead end . The other will be a very different trajectory ; that is , to really become capitalist , which means to increase domestic consumption , to allocate capital much more efficiently , incidentally , in China , the capital market as we know it does not exist . Most of the savings is allocated through the state-controlled banking sector . </s>
So , they’ve got to change that . </s>
And they’ve got to privatize state-owned enterprises -- lots and lots of things that can be done to avert that kind of dramatic slowdown . But that means China will have to do capitalism . Peter Schiff . </s>
I don’t think he wanted my -- No , you’re here . </s>
You’ve got the right . Well , I think , ultimately , and this is the bed that I’m making , the Chinese are going to make -- the biggest problem that is impeding economic growth in China is their currency peg and the misallocations of resources that are being created in that economy by their desire to prop up the dollar so that American consumers can keep buying Chinese products when , in effect , we’re too poor to buy those products because we have nothing to export to pay for them . And I do believe that the Chinese are going to see the error of their ways . And when they allow this change to happen , when they allow an appreciation in the value of their currency and they allow their citizens to more fully reap the rewards of their hard work and their savings , I think you’re going to see a much greater growth trajectory in China . And I think a lot of some of the problems that we’re discussing here will go away as the Chinese economy is allowed to prosper and the government gets out of the way and lets it happen . </s>
Right down in front here . My name’s Miles London . My question has to do with capitalism implies that there is a capital market . The fact that the U.S. and Europe for that matter has promoted the idea for the general -- for the better of the general good to haircut bond holders in order to save stock holders , is that driving the U.S. capitalism to be more like the Chinese capitalism as has been described ? </s>
No one’s excited . Peter Schiff . Well , you know , in the original . </s>
Oh , all right . Peter Schiff . </s>
Well , you know , in the original Wall Street bailouts , it was the stockholders that , in many cases , absorbed the losses . The bond holders got bailed out . But , to your point , in the long run , we are going to wipe out the bondholders , and we’re going to do it through either inflation or default . Most likely it will be inflation . I mean , it could be default , but the more likely outcome is that we simply print so much money that the bondholders are deprived of their purchasing power . </s>
And that is not a free market . A free market would have sound money . </s>
It wouldn’t have the government issuing a currency by fiat and then deciding to punish savers at the expense of debtors , which is going to happen in the United States , especially when you realize that the U.S. government , being the largest debtor of us all , is going to benefit more from inflation than any other debtor . I think there’s a broad question here that is very interesting , the question of is the United States going to have become a little bit more like China in this environment as the global market becomes a little bit less free . And I think that part of the reason I’m skeptical it will happen is because the U.S. government is so badly set up to do it . I mean , I can’t even write an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal and include the words “industrial policy” because it’s just a no-man’s land . </s>
Nobody wants to talk about it . People in the State Department have said , “Oh , we can’t talk about industrial policy even though it’s kind of what we’re thinking about.” </s>
And so we say economic statecraft . U.S. corporations don’t want to coordinate with their competitors . They don’t want to talk to the U.S. government on this stuff the way that in Japan you would if you’re in the Keidanren . Japan has many -- the ministry of economy of trade and industry . In the United States , we’ve got Commerce , which is not exactly where we keep our best bureaucrats . </s>
And then we’ve got USTR , which is separate actually and much more capable . You’ve got Energy , which is separate . </s>
You’ve got the State Department which owns a lot of this but has very few people who have the background in the private sector , so the U.S. is very badly set up to do state capitalism , and I think that they won’t . But I do think this is going to become an issue we’re going to debate a lot more in this country . Yes , Orville . Quick comment . You know , I think what Ian said is very true . </s>
I was recently on the Vice President Xi 's visit . And we went to California , and I was there with Governor Brown to meet him and meet a bunch of governors . Every one of those governors and party secretaries came with 10 guys in black suits , you know , for trade , for energy , for manufacturing . Brown had me , you know , a non-paid friend . And it was very evident to me that the state capitalism of China had this incredible sort of plug-in mechanism and we didn’t have a socket . </s>
And I think that’s going to have to change if we want to do business with China . </s>
These guys wanted to do business . They love California , and they can’t find a way to do it . We need it . </s>
Okay , we have time for one more question . And last question , sir , blue shirt . My name’s -- hello , my name’s Ed Saper . First of all , thank you all for being here tonight . </s>
It’s pretty striking to me we’ve been talking about capitalism , I haven’t really heard much discussion about entrepreneurship . </s>
So , I’d be curious to hear from the panelists what’s your view of the link between entrepreneurship and capitalism and which country does it better ? Orville Schell . Well , I have to say , I mean , this is something America does exceedingly well . </s>
This is the part of American capitalism that really works -- our innovation , our scaling -- our bringing stuff to market , scaling it up , Silicon Valley . And China does this less well , but I have to say I’ve been around this block for a number of decades . And what I see happening in China is a lot of incredibly interesting self-made entrepreneurs bubbling up from underneath . Where they go , where the private sector of the economy goes , can it become the majority sector ? That remains to be seen . </s>
But this is a very vibrant place . Do n't write it off for one second . So there is innovation . </s>
There is innovation . There is innovation , not full spectrum . </s>
They do n't have Nobel Laureates yet at this far end , but there is innovation . These guys are crafty . They are good . </s>
They are smart , and boy they 're on a roll . </s>
Entrepreneurship is a -- we think about somebody starting at a high tech company , I mean , an entrepreneur could just be a guy that goes out and , you know , starts a fruit stand or a supermarket . You do n't have to be innovative . </s>
But what you have to do is be able to take control of people and property and put them together and run a business in a way to generate a profit . And there are a lot of entrepreneurs making a lot of profit in China . They 're not , not there . </s>
There are a lot of them , and the population of entrepreneurs is growing , and are self-made millionaires in China and more and more of them are being created , and that is going to continue . And that 's a function of gaining more freedom and moving away from a centrally planned economy and grabbing more of free market principles . And as I said earlier , I think that as a young person in China wanting to start a small business , whatever it is , I think that young person in China is going to have a better chance of succeeding than his counterpart here . I think there 'll be fewer obstacles placed in his path -- </s>
Okay . -- by government to that success . Okay . Minxin Pei . I think that young person would be so shocked to hear this because this -- these are the facts , if you are a private entrepreneur in China you can not go into -- you can not open a private bank . </s>
You can not get into telecom services . </s>
You can not get into energy . You can not get international resources . </s>
You can not get into 14 other very important sectors because these are the sectors reserved for state owned companies . You can not get bank loans . You do n't have secure property rights . If you get into a dispute with another entrepreneur , with another businessman , whether you win that dispute does not depend on whether you have a good case , it depends on whether you know the communist party secretary in charge of the legal system . And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . </s>
And here 's where we are . We are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater in turn . </s>
They will be two minutes each . </s>
Remember how you voted before the debate because this is their last chance to convince you that they have argued best . </s>
And you 're going to be asked to vote again once they finish these statements a few minutes from now , and you will pick the winner by doing so . </s>
But , first , on to round three , closing statements -- closing statements by each debater in turn . Our motion is , `` China does capitalism better than America . '' </s>
And here to summarize his position against the motion , Ian Bremmer . He is president of Eurasia Group and author of the upcoming book , `` Every Nation for Itself : Winners and Losers in a G-Zero World . '' Thank you very much . My colleague partner , Minxin , just talked about all the things you could n't do to set up in China in terms of entrepreneurship , but he did n't mention fruit stands . </s>
Those , you can , and perhaps there 's a Tunisian model in the future for China . I think it 's an interesting question . Look , I thought I would end with the future . You know , one of the things the United States does better than anyone else in the world is creative destruction . </s>
I like independent bookstores , but I tell you , when Amazon came along they got smashed . That may not be a society that you all want to live in . You may like independent bookstores . But it’s a society that does capitalism better . </s>
We see that all over the place . Creative destruction is what powers the American market . The single biggest game changing innovation in the world today is fracking and unconventional oil , that is changing the nature of global energy , it is overwhelmingly dominated by U.S. universities and research , U.S. entrepreneurs -- a bunch of Canadians in there , too , do n't want to forget my friends to the north -- and U.S.-based multinational corporations . This matters . I know that the Chinese are doing more patents . </s>
They 're small , they 're engineering patents , there 's a slight improvements on processes . Do n't take away from them . They 're very smart in China . They 're being educated well . They 're great . </s>
But if you want to talk about the game changing stuff that you want to bet on that 's going to make the world work over the next 20 years , overwhelmingly that stuff is being driven in the United States of America . </s>
I do n't know if it 's Bill Gates 's new battery technology that 's going to work and be the next game changer , it 's going to be in biotech , it 's going to be in nanotech , but if you want to make that bet -- and , by the way , the Chinese central bank wants to make it , too -- you 're going to make it here . I love the fact that we live in a society as well where broad ideologies can come together , work together , and make lots of money . I applaud the fact that we live in a place that a guy like Peter Schiff can make an enormous coin for himself , and I think you guys should , too . </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you , Ian Bremmer . Our motion is `` China does capitalism better than America . '' And now to summarize his position for the motion , Peter Schiff . </s>
He is CEO and chief global strategist of Euro Pacific Capital . He is also author of the upcoming book , “The Real Crash : A Blueprint for a Bankrupt America . '' Peter Schiff . Rebuilding . </s>
I think part of the problem having this debate at this particular point in time , it would kind of be like having a debate in 2005 over which country does real estate better , the United States or China . </s>
Because in 2005 , everybody thought it was great in the U.S. with the housing market . Everybody was buying a house , even the people who couldn’t afford them . </s>
Everybody had second homes and it was great . But of course it was a bubble and it couldn’t last . </s>
And that’s the same thing with the U.S. economy . If you want to look at the U.S. economy and measure it by how much money we spend and how much we consume . You look at some of these statistics that you reference about our competitiveness , when the reality is if we’re so competitive , where are all the products and why do we have a huge trade deficit ? I think what’s really happening here is we have a bubble in the entire economy and it is based on excess consumption , excess debt . </s>
The Chinese , they’re not making a big bet on the U.S. treasury market because they want to . It’s because they think they have to . If they can wave a wand and replace all their treasures with gold , they’d do it . The problem is they’re afraid . </s>
Because they know if they try to sell , they’ll crush the market . But we are on the verge of this collapse . And it’s because we abandoned all the principles of capitalism that we once had . </s>
And these are the principles that China is now adopting . As I said earlier , what’s really more important is the pendulum and the direction in which it’s swinging . </s>
Look at where we started from complete capitalism . And China started , they had none of it . </s>
Look at how much ground we’ve surrendered and look at how much the Chinese have gained . </s>
Is China perfect ? Not at all . </s>
They still have a lot of progress to make . But they are making that progress . </s>
The problem with us is we’re still moving in the wrong direction . And we’re moving in that direction more rapidly . And when we actually have our crisis ; when we have a sovereign debt crisis , when the dollar really plunges and we really have to confront the grim reality of our situation , the fact that we’ve been living beyond our means for generations and it has to come to an end , then we can have this debate again . And I think we’ll have a much different reaction in the audience as to how well America does capitalism . Thank you Peter Schiff . </s>
Our motion is `` China does capitalism better than America '' and here to summarize his position against the motion , Minxin Pei . He’s professor of government at Claremont McKenna and author of `` China’s Trapped Transition : The Limits of Developmental Autocracy . '' Does China do capitalism better than the U.S. ? We have to add one adjective . </s>
China does do a certain kind of capitalism better than the U.S. That’s crony capitalism . And I don’t think Americans want to excel in that category . </s>
Because in China , under that kind of capitalism , you are not going to get clean air to breathe . You’re afraid to buy baby formula because if you have babies in the household , you’d better go to Hong Kong to buy imported baby formula because crony capitalism can not provide food safety . And if you are part of the elite , crony capitalism serves you really well . Because I’ve read that elites in China are now installing air filtering systems in their cars , in their homes . But what about ordinary people ? </s>
The vision of capitalism Peter champions is a vision of 19th century capitalism . Thank God America has come a long way and will not go back . Let’s also imagine 20 years from now , which system will be there . </s>
I can safely bet , 20 years from now , democracy , democratic capitalism will still be around in the U.S . But can you say this about the Communist Party in China ? </s>
In the next 20 years with this kind of capitalism ? I’m not so sure . </s>
My bet is that it will not be there . So at the end of the day , it will be American capitalism that triumphs over crony capitalism . </s>
Thank you Minxin Pei . </s>
This is our motion , `` China does capitalism better than America . '' </s>
And here to summarize his position in support of the motion , Orville Schell , an award-winning journalist and director of Asia Society’s Center on U.S. , China Relations . Well Minxin , amen . </s>
I really want to agree with you and I truly hope you’re right . It would be nice . But who would have thought five or 10 years ago , that we would be sitting here tonight even having this debate , that there would be any kind of equilibrium even to discuss between these two great economic systems . </s>
No one . Twenty years ago , impossible . </s>
Thirty years ago when I first went to China , it was unthinkable . China is undeniably in transition . We are a more finished product trying to regain our balance . And I worry about the United States . </s>
I think we have a good model , but I think we haven’t played it very well . I think we’ve deceived ourselves . I think we’ve fallen into a lot of self deception about what has made this country great and strong . </s>
It’s a combination between regulation and control and wisdom at the top setting an equitable and fair system and a free market with a vibrant set of entrepreneurs and innovators at the bottom . </s>
China is still trying to find its balance between these things . I don’t know where they’re going to go . I don’t know how it’s going to end up . I can’t see the future for us or them , but I can see the last five or 10 years . </s>
And I think everyone in this room should acknowledge that despite all its imperfections , despite the human rights questions , despite all of these other things , that what China has accomplished , as counterintuitive as it was , no one could have predicted it , is pretty extraordinary . Something has been working pretty well . </s>
We don’t know where it’s going to go in the future , and all we can do is sit and wait . But if we want to fix something , we’re not going to fix China . </s>
The question is are we going to fix ourselves . </s>
Thank you , Orville Schell . And that concludes our closing statements . And now it’s time to learn which side our live audience feels has argued best . We’re going to ask you to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote . </s>
And we’re going to get the readout on this almost instantaneously . Our motion is `` China does capitalism better than America.” If you feel the side arguing for this motion , this side argued best , press number one . </s>
If you feel this side , press number two . And if you became or remain undecided , push number three . </s>
And we’ll lock out the votes almost instantly . And while we’re waiting for them , I’m going to just do a little bit of housekeeping . First of all , Peter , did I get the name of your book wrong . </s>
Did I -- I said “The Real Crash : A Blueprint for a Bankrupt America” -- “Rebuilding a Bankrupt America.” </s>
All right , that’s a very important missing word . So -- I do want to try to rebuild it . No , no . </s>
I’m working on a book , and if like this , somebody got the name wrong , I would want to shoot myself . So , I want to -- I’m going to read -- Actually , it’s the real -- America is -- no , actually , that’s not even it . </s>
It’s “The Real Crash : America’s Coming Bankruptcy . </s>
How to Save Yourself and Your Country.” That’s the title . Well . Really , that’s the title ? </s>
Yeah , that is it . Yeah . Because I would really like to say it correctly so that we can edit this for the radio broadcast . Yeah , that was an old working title , which got changed . So the title that is actually on the book , that will be on the bookstands in May is “The Real Crash” -- </s>
“The Real Crash , ” right , yeah . I want to say this -- “America’s Coming Bankruptcy . </s>
How to Save Yourself and Your Country.” All right . </s>
I’m pretty sure that’s it . </s>
I hope so , because I’m trying to memorize it . “The Real Crash : America’s Coming Bankruptcy and how to -- </s>
“Save Yourself and Your Country.” -- “and Your Country.” </s>
All right . Peter Schiff , CEO and chief global strategist of Euro- Pacific Capital and author of the upcoming book , “The Real Crash : Something Really Bad , Something Terrible.” I’m sorry . We’re going to have to edit around it . </s>
The title’s not even finished at this point . No , it’s finished . </s>
It’s -- “The Real Crash : America’s Coming Bankruptcy . How to Save Yourself and Your Country.” All right . Yes . You can buy it on Amazon since you like it so much . </s>
You can preorder it . </s>
Our next debate is coming up on April 17th , and here is our motion : “When it comes to politics , the Internet is closing our minds.” Speaking for the motion , we’ll have Eli Pariser . </s>
He is a pioneering online organizer and board president of MoveOn.org . His book , “The Filter Bubble , ” three words , was the -- -- so easy , so easy -- was the inspiration for this debate . His partner booked is Lawrence Lessig , a law professor at Harvard and one of the country’s preeminent legal scholars . He’s been called the philosopher king of Internet law by the New York Times and the Elvis of cyber law by Wired Magazine . </s>
Against the motion , we’re going to have Evgeny Morozov who is a journalist and author of “The Net Delusion.” </s>
He bemoans what he calls slacktivism , which is defined by him as the tendency of the Internet to distract the population from any type of serious political engagement . And his partner , Jacob Weisberg , who first joined the online magazine Slate back in 1996 -- that’s when people were just figuring out what the Internet was . And today he is the chairman and editor-in-chief of the Slate Group . I also want to say that we -- I think all of us with Intelligence Squared are delighted by the spirit with which this panel came to this debate tonight , the level of arguments , the fact that you stuck to ideas , that it didn’t get nasty or personal but was thoughtful and provocative . I want to thank you for the way that you’ve conducted yourselves during this debate . </s>
And also , to the audience questions that were on point and really did help move this debate along , thank you to all of you who stood up and asked questions . </s>
Okay , and so I now have the results . It’s all in . We have asked you to vote twice , once before the debate and once again after the debate . This is the final result on who wins this argument according to our live audience here . Our motion is `` China does capitalism better than America.” </s>
Before the debate , 17 percent of you were in favor of the motion , 50 percent against , and 33 percent undecided . After the debate , 9 percent are for the motion -- that’s down 8 percent -- 85 percent support the motion -- that’s up 35 percent -- 6 percent are undecided . The team arguing against the motion , `` China does capitalism better than America , ” wins this debate . </s>
Our congratulations to them . </s>
And thank you from me , John Donvan , and Intelligence Squared U.S. We will see you next time . True or false : Clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery . </s>
Well , let’s have it out . This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. I’m John Donvan of ABC News . We are at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University where we have two teams of debaters , two against two . They include a governor and investor in green energy , a thinker on green energy , and a writer on the topic . </s>
They will be trying to change your minds because this is a debate . It is not a seminar or a panel discussion . </s>
It is a contest , a contest of ideas and logic and well-presented arguments . In this case , you , our live audience , are our judges . </s>
By the time the debate has ended , you will have been asked to vote twice , once before the debate and once again at the end of the debate . And the team that has changed the most minds in the course of the arguing will be declared our winners . </s>
So let’s go to register your first vote on the motion . Our motion is “Clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery.” If you agree with the motion , push number one . </s>
If you disagree , push number two . And if you’re undecided , push number three . And if you feel you’ve made a mistake , just correct your mistake , and the system will lock in your last vote . I just want to ask -- technically , I have a problem with the wire into my ear , and I’m hearing delightful music , so -- So I’ve pulled it out . </s>
So we’re going to take a little bit of a break . In San Francisco and Washington , I understand they’re actually in a restaurant , so , at this point , while we’re doing this , you can all move on to the hors d'oeuvres . And can I just get a test from the truck that I can -- yeah , I hear you clearly , terrifically . Okay , we’re all back in business again . </s>
So you’ve now voted . That has been locked in , and at the end of the debate , you’ll vote again after the closing arguments , and very quickly we will have the results . So , our motion is “Clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery.” On to round one : opening statements by each debater in turn . </s>
They will be seven minutes each . And debating first for the motion , I’d like to introduce Bill Ritter , former governor of Colorado whose state has the fourth highest concentration of clean energy workers in the country . He’s now director of the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University . </s>
And Bill , I think , with a resume like that , America wants to know what kind of car does a former governor of Colorado drive ? That’s a great question . I have four kids , my wife , family of six . </s>
So , I have a lot of options . We have our own fleet . I did just , because I’m commuting , buy a 1999 Saab that gets a little over 30 miles to the gallon . </s>
So , you’re putting your money where your mouth is . I was driven for four years in a row so I had to do something other than find a driver . It’s nice to be driven . Ladies and gentlemen , Bill Ritter . Thanks , John . </s>
And thank you for being here tonight to discuss what I think is one of the most important issues that we have , really , as a nation facing us . You know , Americans are not a group of people that sit out a revolution . </s>
If you think about our founding and where we come from , we began with a revolution , the American Revolutionary War . </s>
And there have been a few revolutions in our time as well that Americans have not just participated in , but they’ve led . Think about the Industrial Revolution where we established really our ability to be an economic powerhouse . </s>
Or , more recently , the information revolution where we reaffirmed in the minds of the world our ability as innovators and creators and inventors , people who really understand the power of technological development . What is this revolution that is upon us now ? </s>
It is the clean energy revolution . And it’s global . And the question we have before us as Americans is will we lead or will we follow ? </s>
Will we accept a place on the sidelines , or will we actively participate in moving this issue ahead ? </s>
Tonight I’m joined by Kassia Yanosek , who’s my partner in this . </s>
And you’re going to get to hear Kassia as well , but we stand for the proposition tonight that , in fact , clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery . Energy itself , if you think about the revenues generated globally , the largest industry in terms of revenue generation . So , if we get it right , it absolutely can be a significant part of our economic recovery . </s>
And it’s important for us to define the terms to some extent . When people hear “clean energy” in a lot of places in the world , they think it’s just wind or just solar . Kassia and I tonight , we’re going to talk about clean energy in this broad spectrum . It is about renewable , about solar and wind and geothermal biomass , but it’s also about all those parts of the spectrum that involve the things that we’re doing to promote clean energy , and the research and development laboratories across this country , both public and private , how you commercialize that technology and get it into the marketplace , those things that involve transmission and Smart Grid technology that help us to manage loads on grid , those parts of the clean energy world that involve transportation -- think electric vehicles or fuel cell vehicles , hybrid cars -- but again , the broad spectrum . </s>
When we think about clean energy , we do think about natural gas and believe that natural gas and nuclear and even clean coal can perhaps play a role in building out a clean energy economy in America and that it has to be every part of that , from stem to stern , in terms of our thinking about it . It’s important for us to understand as well that workforce development has to be part of our policy considerations . So one of the reasons I’m here tonight and one of the reasons I was fortunate to be invited is because , as the Colorado governor , I said in Colorado , “We’re going to build a new energy economy.” And I said this when I was campaigning , and over a four-year period , I signed 57 different bills into law , bills that we believe made a tremendous difference as it related to our energy portfolio going forward , but particularly relevant to tonight’s topic , made a significant difference in our ability to see economic development attached to clean energy . </s>
One of those bills was a renewable energy standard bill in the first 100 days that took us to a 20 percent standard by 2020 with a rate cap in place for consumers . In fact , last year , the utility and I , after talking with each other , said , you know what ? We can get to 30 percent by 2020 with the same rate cap in place . So , as a state , we’ve got a 30 percent renewable energy standard . But in those 57 bills , we did Smart metering , meaning people who were residential and industrial consumers could actually get paid if they put energy back onto the grid . </s>
We did a variety of things to inspire the bill out of transmission , inspire new technology , energy efficiency . When we talk about clean energy , energy efficiency is one of the most significant things we as a country can do to move this country in a direction toward , in fact , a clean energy economy . </s>
So I’m not going to go through the 57 bills , but what I’ll tell you is the proof is in the pudding . </s>
We have significant economic development tied to that , and I’ll give you just a couple of examples . </s>
Vestas wind turbines , the Danish company , building wind turbines in Colorado , made the announcement just after I made the -- signed the bill . That allowed us to go to a 20 percent by 2020 , they in fact then have four factories since that they’ve announced that , at the end of the day , it’s going to be 2,600 employees , a billion dollar investment . SMA , it’s a German company -- they’re manufacturing solar inverters in Colorado for the first time outside of Germany . </s>
We have home-grown companies , companies , again , where the technology was developed in a laboratory in Colorado we have , the National Renewable Energy Laboratory or one of our research universities , or even private laboratories . One of the thin-film photovoltaic technologies was developed in a Lockheed Martin laboratory , and so we’ve commercialized that and see these companies grow from the ground up . We’ve seen all sorts of growth in this sector , even during a recession . And it’s not just Colorado . </s>
If you look around the country , in places in the Midwest , in the South , in the Southeast , in California , in the Northeast , here in New York , we’ve all sorts of investments in clean energy that is related to job growth . If you look at the last 10 years and if you look at Michigan for example where they 've had terrible job loss . In many of their conventional sectors , they’ve seen job increases , a 5.7 percent increase in jobs in Michigan over the last decade . Colorado had an 18 percent increase and as John said we’re the fourth if you look at where we stand , we are fourth in terms of how we have clean tech workers as a state . </s>
Now in my last minute I’m just going to tell you there’s a reason for doing this that’s beyond just the economic development . We have a powerful example in Colorado , powerful examples around the country that demonstrate economic development as a part of this . But there’re a couple of other things that are very important too . </s>
When you build out a clean energy economy , you actually do something in a very significant way to address the environmental challenges that are upon us . Even if you don’t believe that global warming is human caused there are still significant environmental challenges . </s>
They are a part of a carbon based energy production sector . </s>
And in addition to that you wind up addressing another very serious problem we have in this country which is energy security . Domestically produced energy does a variety of things including reducing our trade deficit and reducing it in such a way that we can look and say the health of the country is better going forward because we have proposed an agenda that relies upon domestically produced energy . </s>
It’s the trifecta , right ? It is about energy security , it’s about environmental security , and it’s about economic security . </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you , Bill Ritter . Our motion at this Intelligence Squared U. S. Debate , `` Clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery . '' </s>
Now to speak against that motion , Steven Hayward , a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , a senior fellow at the Pacific Research Institute for Public Policy , how wrote when Al Gore was given the Nobel Peace Prize you wrote that it was a further degradation of a -- a further debasement of a once prestigious award for Parson Al -- are you saying our former vice president’s a little preachy ? I think it’s fairly self evident , isn’t it ? Ladies and gentleman , Steven Hayward . Thank you , John . Our case against the motion tonight comes in two main parts , first that it represents a brazen case of bait and switch . </s>
I thought there’d be two of them , I’ve already heard of the third one , already tonight . And second that it rests on a basic but surprisingly widespread economic fallacy that paying more for energy will somehow make us richer . There are a number of collateral arguments in our case which my partner , Robert Bryce , will explore further , such as the fact that most forms of so-called clean energy are inferior energy sources , ill suited to many of our needs . Now , the bait and switch comes in just two parts , I’ll have to leave the third for later . </s>
We’ve been told for the better part of the last two decades that we need to make a rapid transition to clean energy away from fossil fuels in order to stave off climate catastrophe . And all of the official assessments of the matter from the national and international bodies that have studied the matter such as the U.N.’s IPCC concluded that the cost of doing so would be substantial . And the pessimists said the costs that would hurt economic growth and lower GDP . </s>
The pessimists said it would hurt a lot , the optimists said the costs would be only modest , but the point is all of the assessments concluded that the sign before the economic cost would be negative . </s>
But with the collapse of meaningful climate legislation here and abroad , and the arrival of the great recession , suddenly the argument for clean energy has been shifted into the form of tonight’s motion . Clean energy will make us richer , it is the path to prosperity itself . Happy days are here again . </s>
It’s the new domain of free lunch economics , I call it three lumens . Now , the basic problem with so-called clean energy is that nearly every form of it is more expensive than the fossil fuel energy it seeks to displace . Now , I know of no economic theory that says the economy benefits by reducing the purchasing power of consumers . </s>
The case for this motion rests on the same fallacy as the retailer who loses money on each sale , but promises to make up for it with additional volume . The second bait and switch concerns what we mean by clean energy , because the working definition of clean energy seems to shift to make the term almost meaningless . </s>
Typically clean energy has meant purely renewable sources such as wind , solar , tidal energy and geothermal , along with environmentally neutral technologies like biomass and biofuels , though I could add that corn ethanol badly failed the test of environmental neutrality . </s>
And despite more than 30 years of strong emphasis on these sources they still account for less than five percent of our energy supply . But now suddenly we’re told that natural gas is a clean energy source that should be used to displace coal . </s>
But there’s something very odd if we’re now counting a fossil fuel , a finite hydrocarbon , as a clean energy source . Do carbon dioxide emissions no longer matter in the definition of clean energy ? </s>
Consider that climate policy orthodoxy says we need to reduce our carbon dioxide emissions to one billion tons by the year 2050 . Today right now , carbon dioxide emissions from current use of natural gas 1.2 billion times . Above the target for every source for the year 2050 . </s>
This is why the Sierra Club , two weeks ago , changed its position and said we should now make it an object of national policy to phase out natural gas entirely by the year 2050 . </s>
Their director of climate and energy told the Politico two weeks ago , quote , “We want people to know that natural gas is not a clean fuel.” Mark Brownstein , Environmental Defense Fund , told Politico , quote “Simply because coal is awful does n't mean natural gas gets to be terrible.” </s>
How is it that natural gas , which , as I say , produces over a billion tons of CO2 , is clean energy , but nuclear power , which produces zero CO2 emissions , is usually considered not to be clean energy . </s>
Governor Ritter includes it as clean energy . The U.S. Congress specifically excluded it from Climate and Energy legislation the last two years . Moreover , if natural gas is clean energy , then guess what , so is oil . </s>
An awful lot of natural gas is produced in the production of oil , and oil has almost the same green house gas emissions per unit of energy produced as natural gas . And if you want to spend enough money , you can make coal clean . </s>
Governor Ritter used the same phrase President Obama likes to use : “clean coal.” And so you 're left with the rest of the clean energy suite that can not scale up without mandates and massive subsidies from taxpayers . And even then , they still fail . </s>
In recent months , you 've seen solar power-makers like Solyndra in California , and Evergreen Solar in Massachusetts , lay off a thousand employees , and cut about half their production capacity , despite receiving nearly a billion dollars in loan guarantees and subsidies from government . And we 've seen a number of bio-fuel companies fail despite mandates of lavish subsidies . </s>
Now , the idea that clean energy will be the sector that leads us out of the recession is equally risible . There are a number of studies on this . </s>
I 'll give you one quotation from a study from the Stanford University , a very highly-regarded energy modeling forum that concluded , quote , “The advantages of increased jobs for renewable energy are vastly overstated at costs prevailing today.” They note that most energy investments produce between two and six jobs . That 's true of conventional oil and coal , and natural gas , but also of renewable sources like windmills . </s>
Well , of course , if you spend a million dollars on any sector of the economy , the Department of Commerce 's models say you get about 9.7 new jobs . That 's why the energy modeling forum concluded , quote , “Electricity generation across all sources creates far fewer jobs than other activities in the economy . Subsidies to either green or conventional sources will detract , rather than expand economy 's job base , because they will shift investments from other sectors that will create warms climates . </s>
In other words , if you 're looking for a sector to generate job growth , to lead us out of the recession , the energy sector , clean or otherwise , is n't it . Now , I 'll conclude with an observation on the essential absurdity of this motion . If this motion were true , we would not need to debate it at all . </s>
Did we have to debate whether railroads , and automobiles , and the telegraph , and the telephone , would transform transportation and communication ? Did we have to debate whether the technology revolution and the Internet would change our lives ? </s>
And change American productivity ? Did we , a hundred years ago , have to debate the motion that new oil , coal , and gas supplies will power the next generation of American industry ? </s>
Of course not . </s>
And above all , did we ever need a mandate from the government , like a renewable portfolio standard , to get consumers to buy cars or desktop computers ? The answer to that is fairly obvious . Clean energy , however defined , does not resemble any of the past histories of recession- busting forces . </s>
And the odd thing is , most recession-busting forces , like the housing sector in previous recessions , are because of this pent-up demand . </s>
There actually is n't a pent-up demand for new energy at the moment . Energy consumption in America has fallen sharply as a result of the recession . Our energy consumption is down by the largest percentage amount since the end of World War II . So building new energy supplies right now makes about as much sense as building new tracts of suburban housing . And by the way , none of the ideas I 've heard tonight , with the partial exception of electrified cars such as hybrids , do anything to affect the one part of the energy picture that bothers us the most , and that 's our dependence on foreign oil . </s>
Most of what you 're going to hear tonight is about the electricity sector . </s>
We can put a windmill on every single house in America , and put solar panels on every roof , and it will not reduce our oil imports at all . The motion , in my mind , fails badly . </s>
Thank you , Steven Hayward . So here 's where we are , we are halfway through the opening statement in this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have four debaters , two teams of two , fighting it out over this motion : “Clean energy can drive America 's economic recovery.” </s>
You 've heard two opening statements , and now onto the third . Kassia Yanosek is founding principle of Tana Energy Capitol , and co-founder of the U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance . We also want to thank her , we were originally going to have , Dan Reicher , who was going to be sitting in this seat . He is literally snowed in , after an avalanche hit a road in Utah last night . </s>
Kassia came extremely highly recommended and was also an enormously good sport to step in on several hours’ notice . So we want to thank you first of all for that . And , Kassia , when I did my quick research on you , I went to YouTube and I found a video of you standing in a business suit , holding a live frog , which was what ? Well , first of all , I love frogs . </s>
And I’m willing to hold one in a business suit . But it was a function I went to in the U.K. for the Prince’s Rain Forest project , so it was -- It was a promotional . </s>
It was a promotional . </s>
And I’m assuming that no frogs were harmed in the filming of that promotion . No , it was a video effect . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Kassia Yanosek . Thank you . Again , my name is Kassia Yanosek and I come to you tonight as an investor . </s>
I’ve been an investor in the energy sector for the past decade , and I used to invest in dirty energy . My background includes investing at Bechtel Enterprises , the private equity arm of Bechtel which is a large engineering firm . I also worked at BP . So I started out my career investing in coal and gas . </s>
And , you know , as an investor , I look for the biggest growth markets . </s>
So that’s why I’m a clean energy investor right now . </s>
I don’t sit in an ivory tower or a think tank . Instead , I often sit in airplane seats , travel around the country , roll up my sleeves , meet with energy innovators and entrepreneurs , and I figure out where to create value in this economy , which is why we’re here tonight . </s>
And this is what we’re talking about tonight . You know , most recently , before starting my firm , I was a senior member of a billion dollar private equity firm that’s deployed millions of capital in the sector of clean energy . </s>
I currently invest with New York investment houses around the subject of innovation and clean energy technologies , and that’s where I think the opportunities are in this market . So I’m going to give you the real story tonight about why clean energy will drive our economic recovery . The other thing I’d like to point out is that I actually don’t think we should be having this debate -- not will it or won’t it drive economic prosperity but how it can drive our economy . We need to start competing and get out from behind our computers where we write op-eds , stop resting on our laurels of the past , stop wimping out about how China is going to cream us . </s>
Is that any way to win a match or a race ? So my goal tonight is to convince us that we can continue to be an innovation leader in other sectors that we’ve done in the past , and that clean energy is the next growth market for the U.S . </s>
And here’s why clean energy can drive economic growth . I’m going to give you three reasons . </s>
First of all , innovation in new industries drives job creation and investment , and I’m going to provide some examples , from I.T . to the auto industry , and also why government has in the past , and it needs to continue to be , an integral part of this growth for the energy sector . Number two , clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth . So , instead of complaining about China , let’s start competing so we can sell into China . And then , third , we do need to talk about our dependence on oil . Oil does not help economic recovery . </s>
Our dependence on oil doesn’t help economic recovery ; it actually hinders economic recovery . </s>
So we actually need a broad menu of energy options to reduce our dependence on any one commodity , which smoothes out volatility and helps our economy grow . </s>
So , point number one : innovation drives job creation and lower costs in our energy sector . </s>
You know , we can see this in our I.T . markets . We now lead the world in research , product , and deployment . And certainly , Silicon Valley has been a huge driving force of the U.S. economy . Right now , I believe that about 16 percent of our total exports are related to advanced technologies . </s>
Well , guess what ? That wasn’t part of our economy 30 to 40 years ago , so clean energy has a great future ahead of it if we’re going to actually put our heads together and start innovating . And government was a big part of that . DARPA which is an arm of the government was instrumental in the development of the Internet . </s>
And secondly , the auto industry -- dinosaur industry . You know , we got our pants beat off by Japan . But guess what ? Detroit is turning around . We’re starting to see Ford and Chevrolet start developing electric vehicles . </s>
There’s a lot of activity out there , and it’s winning accolades . </s>
So it really debunks this view that we can’t afford to have this job creation in the United States . And then , finally , without going too much into the weeds , I’ll point out some obvious statistics about how clean energy is driving investment in jobs . Last year , $ 243 billion was invested in clean energy globally . This is essentially a 25 percent compound average growth rate that we’ve seen over the past five years . </s>
And this is really one of the biggest drivers that we’re seeing in the markets today . In the past 10 years clean jobs grew 9.1 percent in the United States while total jobs grew by only 3.7 percent . So I have a little bit of different perspective and some different statistics than my opponents over there . </s>
And then , finally , I’ll point out that costs are coming down , count down the curve . Electric batteries cost about $ 1,000 a kilowatt hour two years ago ; today it’s about half that , and we’re on track for some very competitive technology that we’re going to see in our electric vehicles within the next 10 years . </s>
So we’re starting to see a real big steepness in the innovation curve . Point two , clean energy will drive exports which are critical to our future growth . It’s important that we grow a domestic market not only for us but for our export markets . It’s an opportunity worth trillions of dollars and millions of jobs . </s>
My opponent actually pointed out a very important point : There is not a whole lot of energy growth going on in the U.S. and in the next 10-20 years . Ninety percent of the growth and energy consumption over the next two decades is going to come from developing countries . So we better get on that so we can actually benefit from the growth that we’re going to see in these export markets . So , finally , we need to learn from the information technology industry . </s>
We need to develop the energy economy the way we did the I.T . </s>
And we’re starting to do that . Clean tech really is where information technology was 30 years ago and where biotech was 20 years ago . So we’re at the beginning of a very long and prosperous future for this sector . And then , point three , we need a portfolio of energy choice . Dependence on fossil fuels doesn’t help economic recovery . </s>
As I said , it actually hinders it . You know , we’re seeing $ 100 oil . We’ve seen this happen before , and price spikes really do not help the economy . Rising energy prices act as a drag on GDP growth . A 10 percent oil shock is -- could actually lower GDP growth by .2 </s>
percent per year for the next two years , and that’s a recent statistic that Goldman Sachs just put out . We’re also seeing that high oil prices can increase inflation which compresses corporate margins , impacts the consumers , so when we talk about the price of energy , I don’t necessarily see that the current state of affairs in fossil fuel is helping the energy economy in keeping costs down for consumers . </s>
So , essentially , with that , I’m going to close with bringing you back to the focus of this debate , which is that clean energy can drive the future of our economy . And , frankly , if you’re not for the clean energy economy , then you’re not for economic recovery . Thank you . Thank you , Kassia Yanosek . </s>
Our motion is “Clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery.” And here to speak against the motion , Robert Bryce . He is the author of “Power Hungry : The Myths of “Green” Energy and the Real Fuels of the Future.” He’s a senior fellow at the Manhattan Institute and former managing editor of the Energy Tribune . </s>
And you write , Robert , in one of your books , about your experience with solar panels , which you’ve installed on your house in Boston and you conclude that , after all , you’re just not sure they’re worth it . Why ? That’s true . What happened up there on the roof ? </s>
I have to get up there and clean them , for one . Second , the economics -- well , the reason I did , I got a subsidy , a nice big fat subsidy . The city of Boston paid two-thirds of the cost , so I got a $ 23,000 system for about $ 8,000 . </s>
But the payback , assuming no cost of capital and assuming electric rates stay flat , is 20 years . The life of a panel is about 20 years , so I don’t know whether it’s a good investment or not . We’ll see . Okay , ladies and gentlemen , Robert Bryce . So , please , by a show of hands , who here is in favor of dirty energy ? </s>
One . Okay , two maybe . Okay , thank you . </s>
That’s what I expected . Well , the fact is that clean energy sounds tremendously appealing . There is no question about it . </s>
And debunking clean energy is a dirty job , but Steve and I are here to do just that . Reality is that clean energy is not a specific thing ; it is a marketing slogan . If you remember , the Waxman-Markey Bill in 2009 was called the American Clean Energy and Security Act . To the specifics , Governor Ritter mentioned natural gas . I am as pro- natural gas as anyone . </s>
I’m also ardently pro-nuclear . N to N , natural gas to nuclear -- I believe these are the paths to the future for a number of reasons . But he also included in his statement that coal , natural gas , nuclear , wind , and solar are clean . The reality is if all of our energy sources are clean , then none of them are . Regarding clean coal , I view that oxymoronic , akin to family vacation or jumbo shrimp . </s>
Took a while , but I’m glad you finally got it . Thank you . Wind energy is often viewed as the political darling of the moment . This is the clean energy source of the future . Well , if you saw WGBH just yesterday they had a story about Falmouth , Massachusetts , in which they talked about the objections and , in fact , the strenuous protest by local residents against a new wind turbine in that town . </s>
I can point you to localities all over the world . I have interviewed people in New Zealand , Australia , Ontario , Nova Scotia , Missouri , Wisconsin , New York , some very heated debates here in New York State over the sighting of industrial wind turbines . What is the problem ? </s>
Infrasound , low level noise that is driving people out of their homes . </s>
The wind energy industry says , “Oh , well , these people that are complaining just need psychological counseling . '' I kid you not . This is a serious problem that they can not solve and they try to dismiss it out of hand , it can not be resolved . My opponent said that natural gas or rather that fossil fuels can’t possibly lead to any kind of economic recovery , I completely disagree . </s>
Natural gas today is selling for less than $ 4 , why ? Because of a tremendous technological innovation in the upstream oil and gas business . It 's selling for about $ 4 per million BTUs , that’s a reduction of about $ 3 per MMBTU compared to just three years ago . </s>
That reduction in price is one of the rare bright spots in the commodity markets in the U.S . It is now saving American consumers $ 65 billion per year or $ 180 million per day , and that’s a minimum number . The reality is clean energy is such a nebulous phrase it can not possibly be supported because the phrase doesn’t mean anything , therefore , you must vote against . </s>
Second point , green jobs do not exist or are so expensive as to be crippling to the economy . If you’d believe the corn ethanol scammers , one of the longest running robberies of taxpayers in this country’s history , they just put out a report last month that said they’re -- they support 70,000 jobs . Well , if you believe the Congressional Budget Office numbers , the total taxpayer cost of the corn ethanol scam is over $ 16 billion . </s>
That works out to $ 230,000 per job . </s>
What about the wind industry ? </s>
We hear this continually from the American Wind -- Energy Association , `` Oh , we’re creating all kinds of manufacturing jobs , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah . '' Texas Comptroller Public Accounts Susan Colmes just came out with a report in December , estimated that every wind job in Texas , where I live , Texas leads the country in new -- in wind generation capacity , 10,000 megawatts , each job associated with the wind industry costs $ 1.6 million to the taxpayers . Third point , clean energy can not possibly drive America’s economic recovery because it is simply too small in scale . I pride myself on doing my research , doing my numbers , here they are . Every day coal provides about 10 million barrels of oil equivalent to the U.S. economy . </s>
Natural gas provides about 12 million barrels of oil equivalent every day to the U.S. economy . We also use roughly 17 million barrels of oil . So roughly 39 million barrels of oil equivalent from those three hydrocarbons , that dirty , nasty energy that nobody likes but everybody uses . Okay , so what about the political darlings of the moment , the clean energy sources that we’ve been discussing here ? </s>
Non-hydro sources because we can’t build any more dams here , geothermal , wind , biomass , and solar . </s>
In 2010 , according to the EIA they provided 166 million megawatt hours of electricity to the U.S . That works out to277,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day . So how does that compare then ? </s>
If we just look at the two dirty , nasty sources of energy , oil and coal , they provide 100 times as much energy to the U.S. economy as the political darlings of the moment , the clean energy darlings of the moment . And if we include natural gas , which I believe is clean incredibly pro-natural gas , the ratio is 140 times as much energy from the three hydrocarbons as we get from the clean energy sources . We could double , triple , quadruple , quintuple the amount of energy that we’re getting from the clean energy sources that we’re discussing here , it will be so small as to make no difference to the U.S. economy , and it certainly will not drive America’s economic recovery , therefore , you must vote against the motion . </s>
Final point , clean energy can not fuel America’s economic recovery because it is simply too expensive . </s>
Latest data from the Energy Information Administration estimate that over the next five years or so , gas fired electricity will cost about $ 63 per megawatt hour , onshore wind will cost about 50 percent more than that , offshore wind , four times as much as that , and solar thermal generated electricity , five times as much as that . </s>
In January , The Los Angeles Times reported on the city of Los Angeles ' goal of having 33 percent of its electricity coming from renewables by 2020 . I quote from The Times , that , “this push for renewables could result in electricity rate hikes of five to eight percent in each of the next five years.” What 's happening now , the city of Los Angeles is quietly rolling back the renewable targets . </s>
In the governor 's , Governor Ritter 's home state , electricity rates have increased by 21 percent over the past six years , and the Denver Post just reported they are likely to increase by 20 percent over the next six . Over the last six years , the increase has been twice the rate of inflation . The reality is that oil price spikes hurt the U.S. economy , there 's no question about that . With the coming rate , electricity rate hikes that will come from these renewable portfolio standards in the electricity markets , will be even worse for the economic recovery . </s>
You must vote against the motion . Thank you . Thank you , Robert Bryce . </s>
And that concludes Round One of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . Now onto Round Two , where the debaters address each other directly , and answer questions from you in the audience , and from me , John Donvan . We 're here at the Skirball Center at New York University in New York . </s>
We have two teams of two on the stage . Bill Ritter and Kassia Yanosek are arguing for the motion “Clean energy can drive America 's economic recovery.” </s>
They are arguing that clean energy is a growth field , it is a revolution , you do n't sit out revolutions . </s>
Their opponents , Robert Bryce and Steven Hayward , are arguing , as a resolution , it 's very tiny , more of a fantasy . We 're going to , now , take questions from you and from them , and have them mix it up directly . And I want to go to the side arguing against the motion , against the clean energy as a solution for America 's economic recovery . Your opponents have made the case that , that the clean energy field represents a field of innovation , that innovation leads to jobs , innovation leads to exports . They cite the computer industry in our lifetimes as an example of this . </s>
Okay , so there 's a certain logic to that , that I think you can see . Sure . Take it on , Robert Bryce . </s>
I 'm glad to , this is an easy one . What is the most admired company in America today ? While it might be Google , I would argue it 's Apple . </s>
Apple 's market cap today is over $ 330 billion . What does Apple do ? It designs its products in the United States , and manufactures them in China . </s>
Are we supposed to be opposed to that ? Are we supposed to say , “Oh , no , Apple , you have to , you have to manufacture those products here in the U.S. , even though it would be much more expensive , and then you need to export them” ? </s>
This makes no sense whatsoever . Apple is an incredibly dynamic company , and incredibly successful company , one of the most admired companies in the world , and yet we 're told , “Oh , no , there 's something wrong with that” ? </s>
Further , and another , just , quick point . We heard that $ 243 billion is invested globally in clean energy . </s>
I have no doubt that that 's the , maybe , the correct number . I can tell you that , here in the United States , the upstream oil and gas industry spends that much alone drilling new oil and gas wells every year . You do n't think that they 're innovating ? </s>
Of course they 're innovating . And what have we seen ? Incredible success in the shale gas revolution that is driving -- </s>
All right . -- down the costs of -- So let me go to your opponents , the two arguing for clean energy as a driver of the economy . You 've heard , he 's basically saying that , yeah , there 's innovation , but there 's not much bang for the buck . </s>
Can you take that on ? Kassia Yanosek . Sure . Well , I think that , you know , first of all , we 're going to have to define what clean energy is . Clean energy is not just wind and solar , which I agree makes up a very small portion , less than eight percent , of our global , of our U.S. power generation . </s>
We have to include cleaner sources , cleaner ways to develop and produce energy that 's being produced from coal , and natural gas , and nuclear . So when we talk about clean energy and the opportunity for economic growth we 're not just limiting ourselves to renewables here . </s>
We 're actually bringing in the opportunity to bring down costs , improve efficiency . One thing we have n't even started talking about tonight is actually energy efficiency , and the opportunities there . So , first , I would say that , number one , this is not a small industry . This is a huge industry . And there 's so much opportunity -- </s>
But the wind power part of it -- -- they 're right , is a small part of it . It 's miniscule -- Wind and solar make up about five percent of our global power generation , in the , well , definitely in the United States , less in the -- And do you see that becoming significantly more in the near to mid-term future ? </s>
It 's certainly growing by leaps and bounds , but , and so , as an investor , I care about growth , and where the best opportunities for investment are . So certainly the growth is happening in the renewable sector , and much higher growth rates than traditional energy . Okay . But I would say that , when we 're talking about , how do you grow the clean economy , it 's about growing opportunity , broadly-speaking . And there are new innovations we have n't even thought about , I mean , think about the electric vehicle market . </s>
We didn’t think about building that market 10 years ago , so there are step changes that we haven’t seen that we need to be innovating for now . Steven Hayward , electric vehicles ? Well , they’ve got an awful long way to go yet . Their performance metrics are not very good . </s>
But that doesn’t mean they can’t improve . No , but you’re going to need to make some huge breakthroughs in battery technology and other things to make them work . It’s sort of going step by step , and I’m something of an optimist on that . But , look , let’s suppose we wave a magic wand and we invent the perfect electric vehicle tomorrow that can be sold at a competitive price to a gasoline engine . </s>
We have what , 100 million cars in this country ? Two hundred million . Two hundred -- those people not only keep them 10 to 15 years , people aren’t going to rush out and buy 200 million cars in the next two years if we do that , so that means we need oil for quite a while to come , right ? </s>
I just want -- I have to say one other thing though to respond to Kassia directly about energy efficiency . And the cars are part of the story , but they’re a separate thing too . </s>
If this debate were scored by the very strict rules of the Oxford Union , Kassia would be ruled out of order for not speaking to the motion . </s>
Energy efficiency is about the consumption of energy and how much of it we consume . Clean energy refers to the supply of energy . </s>
We’re talking about two different things here . Simple thought experiment , seems to me , clears this up . If you have a factory that gets all of its electricity by coal-fired power and you insulate it and do all the things we want to do to weatherize it and you lower your electricity consumption 25 percent , does that make that energy from the coal fire power plant clean energy all of a sudden ? This is like saying we have a motion saying you should eat more vegetables because it’s good for your nutrition and then arguing , but actually , you should just eat less food overall . Let’s bring in Bill Ritter . </s>
Well , I think that’s -- I disagree that Kassia should be thrown out of this debate . I think that that would be a problem -- I said “ruled out of order.” That would be an awful thing for my team . But why are we talking about clean ? </s>
I mean -- Because it’s in the title of the resolution . </s>
No , we say new energy -- the energy sources aren’t new . </s>
The energy sources have all been there , but the transfer has been to talking about clean because we care about emissions . </s>
And that’s really what -- I mean , why do we do this at all ? Because we care about what we emit . And if you don’t buy into human change or human-caused climate change , there are still serious environmental hazards that happen from burning hydrocarbons , right , so we care about clean . And think about an industry that’s focused on people using less energy , and actually , by using less energy , bringing down the cost of energy , that would be the cleanest form of energy because you’re not emitting at all . So , we’ve done a variety of things as a state that looks at how we go into homes where people have fixed incomes , low incomes , but they don’t have very efficient homes and we try and do what we can to modernize those homes and bring down their energy costs . </s>
But , Bill , in your opening , I had more the sense that your argument was that this innovative industry would require -- will create jobs with the establishment of the plants and the factories that build the turbines and that sort of thing . And you’re broadening it now to -- am I right ? That was your point . Well , no , I mentioned energy efficiency somewhere in my opening and probably didn’t give it enough play perhaps because I do think that it is this powerful part of our thinking about clean energy , that we can build an industry around it . </s>
And , quite frankly , a lot of that industry has to do with the construction industry . If you look at this goal that we would reduce our emissions by 80 percent by 2050 , there are people -- scientists -- who believe that we could get there , 40 percent of the way there , just by retrofitting the built environment , and that’s about energy efficiency . But still , I think we haven’t answered Steve’s fundamental point , which is the motion is “Clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery.” I’m all for efficiency . </s>
Who isn’t ? Every engineer in the world is for efficiency . We are getting dramatically more efficient . Today , in America , we use about the same amount of oil as we did in 1973 even though we drive twice as many miles and have twice as many cars , but clean energy , the motion is about the production of energy . That’s the key point . </s>
But I think your opponents are arguing that clean and efficient may be the same thing . </s>
But I think that that is not what the motion says . That is not what the motion speaks to . The motion is about clean , and it’s how you define “clean.” </s>
Okay , then tell us what clean is , because I’m still confused . I think the governor had a very strong point that clean is about -- it could be defined as reducing emissions . And so , by improving the efficiency of a coal fire power plant and natural gas turbines , that , in our definition , is clean . John , if I may . </s>
Steven Hayward . By that definition , all fossil fuels are clean . A few facts then about this . </s>
We have tripled the amount of coal burned in this country since 1970 and reduced sulfur dioxide emissions in that same period by 70 percent . And the EPA expects that we will fall a further 50 percent from current levels just based on existing control technologies that are going to be retrofitted on plants . Right now , changes in technology for burning oil mean that emissions from our car and truck fleet -- of conventional air pollutants are falling by about eight percent a year on net . </s>
The EPA’s own projections , which they never seem to talk about much , project that emissions of conventional air pollutants from the car and truck fleet will fall about another 70 percent over the next 20 years . And I’ve been saying for a long time , “But our grandchildren are going to say , ‘Smog ? What was that all about ? ’” </s>
And actually , having grown up in L.A. , believe me , that’s an impressive thing to say . I really can’t imagine that you’re saying that we should not -- that we should sustain this level of emissions from coal burning plants that we currently have . </s>
No , what I’m saying is that your definition of clean is incoherent . No , no , it’s not because you can look at the different kinds of things that we are undertaking to lessen emissions . And if you’d rather , the operating principle here is that we should look at emissions . </s>
You pick out sulfur dioxide . We’ve done a good job with sulfur dioxide , but if you put in place -- let’s take natural gas -- natural gas , you decreased sulfur dioxide and nitrous oxygen by 70 to 80 percent . You wipe out the mercury . So you’re not mentioning mercury . </s>
We have lakes in this country we don’t eat fish out of because of the mercury that is part of coal pollutant . Mercury emissions , by the way , have fallen 60 percent in the last 15 years , by the way . Robert Bryce . You can eliminate the mercury through natural gas services as well . Robert Bryce . </s>
Thank you , John . Can you say that one more time ? We are using more natural gas . Why are we using more natural gas ? </s>
The coal industry is under obviously a lot of regulatory pressure for mercury . I think it’s appropriate . But they’re also under regulatory pressure for coal ash . That’s certainly appropriate . But last year , in 2010 , according to the EIA , the U.S. used more natural gas than it ever has , 24.1 trillion cubic feet , and yet still the price of gas has fallen . </s>
That is incredibly good news . Your position is that natural gas is clean . I agree . </s>
Your other position is that somehow that fossil fuels are not a benefit to the economy , which I think is completely untenable . Let me move on to one other point . That is clean energy , the fundamental question here -- clean energy adds nothing to the economy . It is only a substitution for existing electricity . </s>
Do I care -- these lights . I like electricity . </s>
But if this wind -- if this electricity is coming from a wind turbine or a solar panel and it costs twice as much as the electricity I might get from a coal-fired or natural gas-fired power plant , where is the benefit to me ? I’ll gladly pay for a nicer tie or nicer -- Let’s let Kassia Yanosek answer that question . If clean energy is more expensive than conventional energy , then how does that help the economy ? </s>
Well , actually , I think you’re wrong on that point . </s>
I mean , if you look at the numbers , and I know you’ve got the numbers because you said clearly you have all the numbers . They are important . You know , the IEA , for example , has done a study of the amount of subsidies that go for the fossil fuel generation globally . I believe that number last year was 312 billion . For renewables , it was about 37 billion . </s>
So we’re not really comparing apples to apples here . So I’ll just start with that . But secondly , I want to clear up this point about what -- Wait , I’m not satisfied with your answer to his point . It wasn’t detailed enough for me . </s>
The notion that -- and I think most of us have that sense that energy provided through alternative -- what we would call renewable alternative means costs more now and will for the long future . And that that doesn’t sound like a way to lift off . Let Bill Ritter -- I think your -- in Colorado , coal , without any price on carbon , is six cents a kilowatt hour . Wind is about nine . </s>
Coal can get to 6.5 . Wind is at nine . And when I became governor , solar was 40 percent more than it is now . In a four-year period , solar came down 40 percent . </s>
Still not competitive with wind if you just say apples to apples , but this is the kind of argument that you hear from you guys . And I’m thinking here about the flat screen TV . It was $ 15,000 a TV four years ago , and now it’s $ 350 . So we give up on flat screen TVs because they cost way too much . </s>
This is something that’s happened and as , I think , Kassia said , this is happening around the world , that people are looking for clean energy alternatives . </s>
You’ve got wind without a price on carbon very close to coal . You’ve got solar coming down 40 percent , and it is our -- incumbent upon us to be innovators and -- Okay . So your argument is through innovation the prices are going to get lower . And I want to take that back to Robert Bryce . </s>
Well , let me just address the subsidy question . The effective subsidy for wind now is two cents per kilowatt hour . But let’s compare apples to apples and take it to per million BTU cost . That is an effective subside of $ 6.44 per million BTU of energy created by the wind industry . </s>
The market price , the market price for natural gas today is under $ 4 . You’re talking about now , but your opponents are talking about future in which the price will get lower through innovation . That’s the point of the flat screen TVs . </s>
Okay , fair enough . </s>
I want a flat screen TV . </s>
We have flat screen TVs in our house . I don’t want a wind turbine next to my house . The demand for -- </s>
But , again , Robert , that’s not the point . Okay , why not ? The point is the price of the energy . Oh , come on , but it was a good one , yeah , . Not the noise of the wind turbine engine . </s>
talking about the history of energy innovation and technology development , and if you look back through the history of how these costs came down the cost curve because it was not always that easy and that cheap to drill for oil and natural gas . </s>
Governments had to be involved ; these industries had to be helped along with industry . </s>
Well , but how long do we need to help them ? </s>
In the Carter administration we heard that solar energy was going to be the dominant form of energy by the year 2000 . </s>
What happened ? The problem here is not about subsidies , it’s not -- it’s not even about want to or belief in global warming , it’s basic physics and math . </s>
I sound a little wonky here , it’s all about power density . How much power can you harness from a given area , or volume , or mass , and that’s where solar and wind just fall down . </s>
We’re talking about one watt per square meter for a wind turbine , for an -- even a marginal natural gas , well , we’re talking about 20 or more watts per square meter . This is basic physics . It’s not about want to or government policy . The reason these energy sources have not been able to get off of subsidies is that they’re fighting uphill in terms of physics . </s>
I think he’s saying the price can’t go down because of the physics of it , because of the space , because of the intensity . No , no , I think that -- seriously , I think that’s your argument and I -- because what does it take to -- these enormous solar farms take enormous amounts of investment in land and you’re saying that it’s going to be a long , long time before it ever pays for itself , so I want to take that back to Bill Ritter because you have experience in this area . Well , again -- so , here , we develop wind farms , we develop them from start to finish in the State of Colorado . We 've got a fellow that’s got 112 turbines on his land , he’s making about $ 5,000 per turbine , so it’s a half a million dollars that he’s earning in income and he’s got 68 acres out of production , 68 acres , he’s still able to farm , this is -- he’s a wheat farmer , still able to farm all of that . And time , after time , after time not only have we seen the ability to put up a wind farm but we’ve seen the economic development possibilities for rural Colorado in an industry that , quite frankly , sort of lives at the margin . </s>
Think about the Mohave Desert right now where they’re building out solar and they’re doing concentrated solar power with natural gas , and this is why I don’t accept that we have this either/or . It’s this false choice . </s>
The folks at Bright Source have 2.6 gigawatts of purchase power agreements with Southern California , and so they’re going to build out these solar towers , and they’re going to put natural gas turbines on there , and if you look at the emissions , back to thinking about it in terms of emissions , if the sun shines like it’s supposed to in the desert , and the rest of it’s natural gas , they get 24-hour power , but they reduce emissions 75 percent in that 2.6 gigawatts of power going into Southern California . </s>
Steven Hayward . Well , this raises an interesting point about how there is no form of energy that doesn’t have some kind of environmental tradeoff except maybe for that bicycle generator the professor made for Gilligan . So environmentalists are -- have a whole bevy of lawsuits against those solar power projects right now in California because they’re built on the habitat of the desert tortoise and other endangered species , and there are separate lawsuits to block the very long transmission lines you have to build to bring them into Southern California . At last count there are 70 wind projects around the country that are facing environmental lawsuits to stop them for various impacts . You know , we get upset when birds die from a spill in the Gulf of Mexico , okay , fine . </s>
Windmills kill about 10,000 birds a year , and they also kill a lot of bats . And , you know , bats , as you know , have sonar . Do you know how wind -- and they don’t run into the blades like birds do . Do you know how they kill the bats ? </s>
Air pressure changes by the blades explodes their lungs , so there’s no form of energy itself , the point is , is that not only have we heard that fossil fuels are clean , but so-called clean energy sources have their own environmental defects , and I’m still waiting for a coherent definition for clean for you that doesn’t conveniently feed into whatever it is you guys like . </s>
Kassia Yanosek . Well , first of all , I’m a fan of frogs , but not of bats , so I’m not actually going to take that argument on . What about birds ? How do you feel about birds ? </s>
But , again , I 'm a frog person , so I 'm just going to . I 'm a bird person . But I want to go back to this , you know , definition of clean energy and the cost issue because there 's something that we have not really been able to focus on tonight and that is the actual reason we 're here , to talk about growing the economy and if clean energy can actually get us out of this economic challenging environment that we 're in . So first of all we talked about our view of what defines clean energy , it 's about more efficient , cleaner energy in terms of less emissions , it 's about not just talking about wind and solar here , but innovations that go beyond wind and solar . </s>
It 's about cleaner fossil fuels . It 's about innovations we have n't seen yet . It 's about energy storage and all the ancillary investments and innovations that need to go on to building and creating a new energy economy . And then , going back to the cost issue , I think we 've made some very big points tonight , about how the costs are coming down the curve . </s>
And we need to be spending our time , and money , and efforts right now building an innovation economy . Because not only do we need to do that domestically , but we need to , we need an investment strategy for how we 're going to be building our export economy . Kassia , where are the jobs in what you 're talking about ? </s>
The jobs are all over the place . They 're everywhere , from investment houses , research firms , there are engineering jobs . So , I used to work at Bechtel and BP , you know what Bechtel and BP 's biggest problem is ? It 's about getting young people into that business , into their businesses . Because people do n't want to be drilling engineers . </s>
They want to be solar entrepreneurs and energy engineers . So -- Well , we need to change their minds . Steven Hayward , of jobs and clean energy . Well , I wrote down something Kassia said earlier about “oil wo n't help us with our economic predicament.” </s>
Well , tell that to the people of North Dakota , which currently has a 3.5 percent unemployment rate because they 're having an oil boom . </s>
And , by the way , it 's the state where they budget surplus , which Governor Ritter might find it a nice thing to have . I am tempted , by the way , to ask Governor Ritter , maybe I will , how many jobs might you get in Colorado if we opened up the oil shale , 800 billion barrels worth that the Department of Energy says could be produced at about $ 50 a barrel . That might produce some jobs for something we actually need , which is more oil supply . Right , right . But the question , and I take your point that the oil industry provides jobs , but their point is that the clean energy industry will provide jobs . </s>
And what did you just . You know , I testified on the green exports idea to a congressional committee a few months ago , and I looked up the latest figures . </s>
We currently have a $ 20 billion trade deficit in green energy components , wind , and solar , and things of that kind , because , and that 's why the company in Massachusetts moved to China . Like our computer manufacturers , Robert mentioned , they can make it cheaper than we do . They also have the raw materials that we do n't have , by the way . We only have one lithium mine in this country , by the way , we can talk about lithium batteries later , if we want . </s>
And so , you know , I agree to some extent that we will do a lot of innovating here , but the manufacturing is going to be done overseas , folks , for all the traditional reasons , sorry about that . Well that 's not true about wind -- Bill Ritter . -- that 's not true at all about wind , we 've got Vestas wind turbines , that 's 2,600 jobs . </s>
You ca n't make small of 2,600 jobs in a state like Colorado , it 's five million people . And a variety of other parts of the wind manufacturing sector . </s>
And , quite frankly , you have it in Pennsylvania , you have it , I think , in Ohio , you have it in Iowa . Where there is wind manufacturing , you can not do those jobs in Canada , or China , and that 's part of the reason Vestas located there . </s>
But even as it relates to solar . I wonder if there 's a debate in China tonight , where they 're saying , “you know , SunTech moved to Arizona , and they 're making things in Arizona , and so , this is a bad thing for us to do in China , to invest in an innovation economy.” They 're not doing that . </s>
And there are solar companies that are coming here , manufacturing here , from China . There 's exports we have to China . And the solar industry itself is a net exporter outside of the United States . It exports more than it brings in . Well , fair enough , I mean -- </s>
Robert Bryce . I 'm much more bullish on solar than I am on wind , and if you look at the data from John Byrne at the University of Delaware , he talks about the learning rate in the solar industry and solar PV , and has talked a lot about the price on solar PV coming down . I 'm very encouraged by that . I have PV panels on the roof of my house ; I wish I was able to buy them now instead of eight , nine years ago , as I did . But what is happening globally ? </s>
And then , when we talk about what 's happening in the U.S . In Europe , Holland , Spain , Germany , all across the EU , we 're seeing huge cuts in these renewable solar , renewable energy subsidies . In your own home state , Governor , Xcel is cutting their solar subsidies by half . Why ? Because they 're too expensive . Now , let me address the issue of cost here . </s>
Because as I pointed out , the EIA numbers show that renewable energy from solar and wind is significantly more expensive than is conventional electricity . Forty-three million Americans are today on food stamps . </s>
They 've set records , now . Twenty-six consecutive months , the food stamp roles in this country have increased . The food stamp roles today are 40 percent higher than they were just three or four years ago . Do you think that these people are living on the edge of hunger , care whether their electricity is green or not ? </s>
All right . I do n't think they do . I want to go to the audience for some questions now . And I want to remind you again , to make , keep it terse , and to try to think of , keep our motion in mind , that we want to stay on this topic , and , this very rich topic is very easy to go off in many different directions . </s>
We really want to bring it on , back to the issue of the effect on the economy of the clean energy industry and developing it . And , if you raise your hand , there are people in the audience who will come to you with microphones , and hold it about this far away from your mouth , about a fist 's distance away , so that it can be picked up on the radio and television broadcasts . And before we do that , I just need to do one more little bit for television and radio . This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. Our motion is “Clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery.” I’m John Donvan , your moderator . </s>
We have four debaters , two teams of two , debating this motion . “Clean energy can drive America’s recovery.” </s>
All right , let’s go to some questions now . There’s a gentleman in a blue shirt and a blue blazer , right at the edge of the aisle . All right , Mr. Hayward , we’re in New York City , NY University . </s>
As you walk around the city , look up at the chimneys and you’ll see the black smoke coming out . Well , here at NYU , the Institute of Policy Integrity teaches us that one percent of the buildings in New York City burning bunker fuel produces as much pollution as all of the cars and trucks in the city . Two hundred and fifty-nine people die every year because of respiratory diseases . </s>
Over $ 1 billion a year in health costs -- What is your question , sir ? </s>
-- economic benefits are almost a billion dollars . It seems to me that replacing the bunker fuel with natural gas , okay , would be vastly cleaner , would give us lots of jobs , would return almost $ 2 billion to our economy on a yearly basis . That would help our economic recovery . </s>
Steven Hayward . Now the odd thing to me is that it’s still allowed to be burned in New York City or any urban area . </s>
The odd thing about New York’s air quality -- I did a whole book on air pollution a few years ago , conventional air pollution -- is air pollution levels are actually higher in the suburbs in downtown Manhattan for some really odd and quirky reasons . </s>
Look , I won’t quote with your figures . The EPA’s got a thing out last week about conventional energy . I’m not sure that it nets out to saying that this is going to be an engine that’s going to drive our economy the way housing has done in previous sectors , the way high technology has done . </s>
And that’s the promise of the resolution tonight . You see , this is going to lead us to a boom , right . And I’m just saying that it seems to me it looks like any other sector that will produce only modest results . Sir , what do you think of that answer ? If you could rise again , so the camera can find you . </s>
Do you feel your question was addressed ? No , I didn’t . Why ? </s>
But be specific . Why not ? </s>
I think he just disagreed with you . It may be . This is a question of perceptions . </s>
To me , it sounded like you just avoided it . If we put -- No , I said I don’t know why it’s allowed to have bunker fuel being burned here at all . It astounds me . </s>
It would have been shut down in L.A. 30 years ago . Well , I think there are a lot of people who would say we don’t understand why it’s allowed to burn oil just about anywhere , why it’s allowed to burn coal anywhere . We have much cleaner alternatives . Converting to those alternatives in many cases will be cheaper , and this New York example is very specific , which is vastly cheaper . </s>
Robert Bryce . Natural gas is much cheaper than bunker fuel . </s>
Fair enough , but did you arrive here by car tonight ? No question , I live in New York City . I took the subway . We don’t have cars in New York City . </s>
I came here in a car , and it burned that dirty , nasty oil , and so I’m kind of biased toward it , I guess . Come live in a city where it’s clean . Let’s go to this side . That one hurt by the way , it really did . Yeah , you walked into that . </s>
I did . I’m really glad I went back to you on that . There’s a gentleman in a leather jacket right by the end of the aisle . And if there are folks in the back where the lights aren’t on , I want to let you know , I can’t see you but there are some seats down towards the front . If you want to make your way down , I could then see you and call on you . </s>
Sir ? On the subject of cost , can both panels give us an outlook -- their outlook -- for the price of oil , let’s say going out five , seven , 10 years , because that seems to be key to the proposition . If the price of oil spikes and stays there , then there is really no choice but to innovate . If the panel thinks it stays flat or goes down , then we have options . Let’s let Kassia , yes , you can take that . </s>
Okay , so , I’ll answer in two parts . Number one , the spike issue -- I think that we’re vulnerable to price spikes in any environment over the next five to seven years . </s>
Currently we’re experiencing a price spike . We could see that again in two years . We could see that in five years . We could see that in another month . </s>
I think that one other point I would make , and this is based on my experience at BP , which is that , we’re not going to see oil at $ 10 or $ 20 a barrel anymore . </s>
And part of that is because the above- ground and below-ground risks have changed for the oil industry . </s>
So , number one , we have to drill further and in more difficult places to get the oil out of the ground . Clearly , we’ve seen that in the Gulf of Mexico incident . And then , secondly , the above-ground risks . </s>
So most of the oil in the future is going to be developed in non-OECD countries , and we’re already seeing that happen . So what does that mean ? It means that the natural oil companies have more control over their resources and that it is certainly raising the cost of getting a barrel of oil out of the ground for the IOCs , for the independent oil companies . </s>
And is the point of your question then that as the price of oil goes higher , it makes alternatives more viable economically ? If it goes high enough , there’s really no choice . Okay , let me put that to the other side . Steven Hayward . </s>
Yeah , it’s -- this is an interesting question , and I’m almost reluctant to take it on because it’s going to help out the other side slightly perhaps if they have the wit to pick up on it . We actually already got off oil once . In the late 1970s , oil was the number two source of electricity generation in this country , and now it’s less than one percent . </s>
And how do we do it ? Well , coal and nuclear power . And the interesting thing is that in the first oil shocks in the ‘70s , about half of our energy -- total energy consumption was from oil . </s>
Today it’s now about 35 percent . We’ve gradually electrified more . And so , some of the things we’ve briefly mentioned tonight like electric cars , better battery storage and so forth , that would give us some option over time to accelerate a transition away from oil . </s>
I’ll just say about the first part of the question , predicting oil prices out five years has made fools out of more people than I’m able to keep count of , and so I don’t do it anymore . And there aren’t any simple solutions to that . Well , that almost does help the other side , your answer . I can see why you didn’t want to take it on . I’d like to get a female voice , but everybody raising hands that I see -- ah , thank you . </s>
Let the mic come on down , just for the balance . I have a question about other kinds of consumer products because there’s a lot of focus on the automobile industry and , like , you guys mentioned computer products , but what about growth in other kinds of consumer products , like that seems like that could be a possibility to grow the economy ? </s>
In relation to -- but how do you relate that to the energy issue ? I’m not sure what you’re saying . Oh , I’m saying that there’s a lot of products that have been advertising themselves as like green products . Okay , thank you . Steven Hayward . </s>
To sort of address that , I’d recommend reading John Tierney’s column in The New York Times today that talks about one of the problems in energy efficiency is that we end up consuming more energy down the road . So , one of my favorite examples is jet aircraft engines , 70 percent more energy efficient than they were 30 years ago . Do we use more jet fuel or less jet fuel today than 30 years ago ? Well , more because we fly more because it brought the price down . So everybody’s got these things , right . </s>
These things have the electricity footprint of a refrigerator , not the device itself . That’s absurd obviously , but when you think about the network of cell towers and the electricity that goes into all the servers that we plug into and we download data and make calls , that gives each one of these smart phones that we all have the electricity footprint of a refrigerator . So we get a lot more energy efficient appliances through mandates and standards and also the marketplace driving it that way , but we find more things to spend energy on , which is why even though we get more efficient year by year -- actually better than European countries in the last 10 years -- our energy consumption continues to go up . We keep buying gadgets like that . </s>
I want to take the question to the other side , Bill Ritter , because I think the question was , in a sense , talking about refrigerators and other green energy-rated devices and that that’s the sort of innovation that I think your side is talking about , that there’s growth there and that there are jobs there . If Dan Reicher were here and not stuck behind an avalanche in Utah , he would now tell a joke about a fridge to the future because he talks about refrigerators as this way to think about energy efficiency and , you know , the energy use of those refrigerators has come down , there’s greater volume , and 75 percent less energy use since the early 1970s because of a commitment to innovation . You’re right . You know , as it relates to the PDA , they’re very -- they go to data centers . </s>
Those data centers consume a lot of energy . That makes our point , right . We can’t keep the demand for energy growing . You said at one point in time that it’s less , but then you just said it’s more . </s>
And I think , you know , you look at IBM . IBM understands they use data centers very heavily , and you know what IBM’s made a commitment to ? Green energy . </s>
And they’ve made a commitment to clean energy because they understand that there are costs maybe apart from just the economic costs of continuing to have this industry that uses so much energy rely on fossil fuels or rely heavily on coal . </s>
So IBM in Colorado has the greenest data center I think , maybe , in America , and they did it specifically because of their energy demand growing and not wanting to be viewed as a polluter . Did he get you ? </s>
Well , okay , being in favor of efficiency is like saying you’re in favor of air or breathing . I mean , at a certain point , it makes no -- it doesn’t set you apart at all . </s>
The economy is becoming more efficient because , as Steve’s example with the iPhone . You mentioned flat screen televisions . As flat screen televisions become cheaper , people buy more of them . I don’t know how many -- I have seven computers in my house now . </s>
I used to just have one . </s>
Now part of it -- I have teenagers , but the reality is that as we become more efficient , we use more because we have more excess money to then buy more , to do more . </s>
So this is not a new area of study . The Jevons Paradox , William Stanley Jevons , 1865 , wrote a book called , “The Coal Question” , laid this out very clearly , and so the idea -- and he said it very clearly . He said that , in fact , as you become more efficient you use more fuel . It is paradoxical . Now , in the U.S. and the developed countries we may be plateau-ing in terms of our energy use , but look at the three billion other people who live in the five most populous countries in the world , China , India , Brazil , Pakistan , and Indonesia , they use on a per capita basis one-tenth as much energy as we do . </s>
So , the fact is , as we become more efficient , we are . All around the world people are becoming more efficient , but they’re using more energy because it’s our nature to do so . </s>
All right , let’s go back to the audience . Sir , you 're -- got -- I’m looking right at you . If you just stand up -- Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , he just went like that . Got an unusual hat on . I didn’t want to say the hat part but worked . </s>
It 's actually the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , Michelangelo . </s>
Just thought I’d educate you in that . That’s good . That 's good . All right . </s>
Don’t make me regret this . </s>
I think you already do . Well , I guess that alleviates my first question . My second question would be -- this is to all of you -- where should America see the rest of the world in this ? Like , should we see them as enemies , should we see them as friends , business partners , should we see their governments as business partners ? I mean , where does the rest of the world play into America’s economic recovery in terms of clean energy ? </s>
Kassia Yanosek . I think we see them as all of the above . I certainly would say that when I think about where I want to be putting my dollars to work I think about , “Where are my export markets ? Where are my customers ? ” I mentioned a statistic earlier tonight that 90 percent of the real energy growth that’s going to be happening over the next two decades is in non-OECD countries -- developing countries . </s>
So we have to be partnering , we have to be developing our customer base ; we have to be developing the appropriate trade policies . You know , one of the points that was made earlier tonight was that Apple was viewed as a great company , and Apple has innovated here in the United States , the value is created , the IP is here , some of the manufacturing 's abroad . </s>
We’re going to have to have some , not all , certainly for the large cap-ex projects where it makes sense to have local industry develop those products like wind , that needs to be domestic , but for certainly for a lot of other products we will need to partner with place -- with countries like China . Robert Bryce . </s>
Just quickly in terms of one of the issues -- in terms -- your question is a complicated one . I think we’re partners , we 're competitors , it depends . </s>
But one of the best pieces of news that I’ve read in the last three months was in West Bengal in India , ONGC , the Indian energy giant announced the first shale gas production from a shale gas well in West Bengal . We’re seeing now shale gas production potential in Poland , in Australia , in China . </s>
The potential for natural gas is to set a new paradigm globally , for a low carbon , clean burning , energy source that is cheap , ultra abundant , and reliable to produce electricity to use for transportation is incredibly good news . Where did it come from ? It came from the United States . </s>
So are you agreeing with the other side on this point ? With regard to innovation in -- yes , look -- well , innovation is -- Innovation is innovation , and it is going to spread no matter whether it’s in the oil field or in flat screens TVs or whatever . We’re agreeing with them if we agree with their very elastic definition of clean . You’ll notice this in the old fossil fuel industry . </s>
I think the question is an interesting one , I think there’s two parts to it . One is the traditional question about competition for resources which is , you know , a big knotty question . </s>
The second one is closer to our resolutions about tonight which is competition for a technological edge in energy . </s>
So we hear that China’s going to spend 850 billion the next 10 years on renewable -- or , yeah , renewable energy , yeah , wind , and solar , and so forth . Let’s just round up and call it an even trillion , you know , a lot more than we’re going to spend on it . </s>
Partly , by the way , I think they’re creating an export industry to us saps , but that’s my opinion , but the other part of it is they’re going to spend five to $ 10 trillion on old fashioned coal and natural gas . India , the ratio will look similar because they need so much more energy and I think as Robert says , I have a hunch that our export numbers in traditional coal , oil , and natural gas drilling is going to be a lot larger than our exports even in the best IP we have in the -- you know , batteries and other purely clean technology . Your opponent arguing for clean energy , Bill Ritter would like to come in on this . I’m going to respond to this a little bit differently . </s>
I lived in Zambia for three years as a Catholic missionary and I’m telling you we could do all sorts of things in innovating products that we could export to very , very poor countries where their ability to use energy differently could help them expand their economies in a ways that we do n't now think of . In the university that I 'm now at , Colorado State University , we developed a two-cycle engine at that university that really can reduce emissions in a tremendous way . If you think about India and the use the two cycle engine , so . </s>
We have , actually , this other thing that 's , apart from just the economic driver , we have this other thing that happens with innovation , that can be very positive for some of the poorest places in the world . Okay . Ma'am in the blue , light , powder-blue sweater . </s>
This evening , no one 's really addressed the fact that we have a very aging electric generation infrastructure . And that 50 percent of our generation today , approximately , is produced by coal . And most , many of those plants are very old and aging . And even the younger plants , that are maybe 20 years old , have been grossly under-invested in . So what I do n't hear tonight is , it 's not simply about , you know , making money , it 's about the risk of producing electricity . </s>
It 's not simply that the electricity grows , is not going to be there , it 's that what 's going to happen and who 's going to produce the investment that needs to be made in our generation infrastructure -- All right , but that -- but , ma'am , that could go to either channel , so can you relate it to our , I mean convention -- I 'd like to relate it to these folks , who have not really addressed this issue -- So what 's -- It 's a huge investment opportunity , for , it 's an investment opportunity that our economy , quite frankly , can not afford to miss . </s>
And I 'd like your comments -- You mean investment in clean energy . </s>
I 'm saying the investment in our electric generation infrastructure for the next 15 years . </s>
Okay , I 'm going to pass on the question , because I really need you to relate it to the motion , which is clean energy . Well , the issue is that clean energy , and investment in things like fuel cell technology , okay , are critical to figuring out how the investment , for example , in our coal plants , needs to be made . Okay . And there 's a whole area -- No , you did it , you hit it . </s>
So , Robert Bryce . If you look at any of the projections , Deutsche Bank did a report on this in December , the Energy Information Administration , the vast majority of new electric generation capacity in the United States will be , over the next 20 years , natural gas-fired . And I 'm fully in favor of fuel cells , they are still far too expensive to be commercially viable throughout most of the U.S. , unless you 're in California , where you get those big subsidies . </s>
What are they going to run on ? Natural gas . There 's also the question about the grid there , which is a long subject -- Yeah . </s>
-- that I think we should n't actually try . But if you really insist , we could do that . No , I 'm not insisting . Kassia Yanosek . I 'm going to make a quick point on this , because I think it 's a very important one . </s>
And you 're right , we did not really address it tonight . I work with utilities quite a bit , and those that are very exposed with their coal fleets -- -- they are very concerned , and very interested in figuring out energy , again , the future of energy innovation , and how they can strategize the future portfolio for the next five , 10 , 20 years . And yes , natural gas is definitely going to be part of that solution . </s>
But guess what , we 've had experiences where we 've had a big build-up in natural gas power generation , I experienced it in California when I was working for Bechtel , we were building and investing in natural gas power plants , one a week , almost . And guess what , the net price of natural gas spiked 10 , $ 13 a kilowatt hour . So , guess what . We need to be thinking a bit broadly about how we 're going to be developing our future generation plate , because you 're absolutely right . We 've got a big challenge ahead of us , and we need to be thinking very broadly about a big portfolio -- </s>
Right . I do n't think your side disagrees with what she just said . No , I -- No . </s>
We 're moving more toward natural gas , not just in the U.S. , but globally . Why ? Because we 're de-carbonizing the global economy . The de-carbonization trend has been underway for 200 years . It 's going to continue for the next 200 . </s>
It will include solar panels , it will include fuel cells , it will include a lot of things . But we 're moving toward cleaner fuels . Why ? Because it 's what we want as consumers . Okay . </s>
So that sounds like that could drive the economic recovery in America , to do that , right ? </s>
It will , because natural gas is cheap . Natural gas is only one part of it , though . </s>
We 're getting , I mean , and I agree , it is a part of it . We actually are promoting the use of natural gas . </s>
But to focus it solely on that fossil fuel is still -- Let me just ask one question , then , Governor . </s>
So you 're pro-natural gas , I am too . So a lot of our natural gas is produced alongside oil . </s>
So you 're bringing oil and gas out of the same well bore . So the natural gas is clean , but the oil is dirty . No , I was n't saying that at all . But I do think , I did n't say that oil was dirty . What I said is , we have a supply of natural gas , it is cleaner burning , we have the technology and government sponsored the natural gas turbine to get to a place where it became more efficient , and increased its efficiency by 30 percent . </s>
Interesting that it was a government subsidy that actually made that happen , but the fact of the matter is that natural gas or oil should not be the only part of our portfolio . If we really look at this from an emissions perspective , you get a 50 percent reduction in emissions at best from natural gas when you transfer it from coal . But with a portfolio that includes all these other things , we can get to this 80 percent reduction by 2050 . We can’t get to there from a natural gas -- </s>
It won’t happen , no way . Not a chance . </s>
I can’t believe that nobody ever seems to do the math on this , except by the way for some researchers at the University of Colorado in the governor’s home state . That 80 percent reduction takes us back to , as I mentioned earlier , about a billion tons of CO2 . The last time we emitted a billion tons of CO2 from fossil fuel sources in this country was over 100 years ago when we only had 92 million people living in the country . </s>
One factoid for you : if the share of just our households , so our houses and apartments and condos that we all live in , if the share of CO2 emissions from the household sector is proportionally the same in 2050 as it is today , the emissions of CO2 will have to be no more than 206 million tons . </s>
Today , carbon dioxide emissions from current household natural gas use : 236 million tons . We can not use more natural gas and make that target , Governor . The math does not add up . </s>
Quick point , John . </s>
To hit that 80 percent reduction by 2050 would take U.S. CO2 emissions to current level of emissions in North Korea , Syria , or Cuba . It is not going to happen . It is a pipe dream , and I think it’s irresponsible for the government to even be repeating those numbers , and the president has said them and I think it’s just -- </s>
All right , once the word “irresponsible” come out , I have to give you a comeback on that . </s>
No , I don’t think it’s irresponsible at all . This is totally achievable . This is totally achievable through a variety of strategies that include investment in clean energy , that includes renewables , that includes nuclear , that we can look , and we’ve said clean coal -- people are like , what’s clean coal ? Well there is also -- </s>
Can you give me an emissions inventory ? What’s that ? Can you give me an emissions inventory for 2050 , of specific sources that will add up to more than a billion tons ? Well , no , I’m not able to sitting right here , but what I’m telling you is that it’s absolutely achievable and the reason it’s achievable . So , I don’t know -- </s>
If it’s absolutely achievable , you ought to be able to tell us how . I think we’ve reached a point -- we’re at the religious stage of the -- </s>
Can I finish one thing ? </s>
Steven Chu’s a -- he’s a Nobel laureate , right . He’s the secretary of Energy , and what he’ll tell you is that 40 percent of those emissions reductions you get from retrofitting the built environment , so it’s not about growing the portfolio . It’s about finding ways to do energy efficiency . </s>
That’s statistically misstated , by the way . It’s from our building sector , you get 40 percent . That’s not 40 percent of total emissions . </s>
It’s only about 10 percent total emissions . All right . I’m going to cut this off , and there’s a bearded gentlemen -- we were making eye contact before . I would really love it if you didn’t read your question because you know what it is . Rather than just the meaning of clean energy , I’d like to ask the question about the meaning of economic recovery . </s>
Given that until just now , nobody had the sort of the wherewithal to bring up climate change because there’s some who will contest the indisputable scientific evidence behind global climate change , I’d like to just ask that if there’s the potential for climate change to derail not only our society but our entire economy in the longer term , in the middle term , in the long term , can we choose to act in any other way but to embrace the precautionary principle and address this problem immediately rather than finding out what happens with clean energy and -- </s>
Robert Bryce , you write directly to this issue in your new book , so why don’t you take that question . Well , I’m agnostic on the question of climate change . I’ve read both sides on the CO2 that some say it’s catastrophic , others say that it’s not a problem . </s>
To me , it’s , okay , if you believe CO2 is bad , then what ? What is the solution ? </s>
And I say it clearly has to be natural gas and nuclear , and nuclear in particular because of the power density numbers because you get such incredible amounts of energy from a very small amount of real estate and relatively small amounts of steel and concrete . And those resource inputs are going to be incredibly important going forward . So , you know , were I the king , if I were the energy czar , I’d say let’s go nuclear in a big way because of the obvious benefits . </s>
And I think that the people who are , in my view -- if you are anti- carbon dioxide and anti-nuclear , you’re pro-blackout . Let me bring in Kassia . Let me bring in Kassia Yanosek , and then I’ll come back to you . Kassia , can you make this one brief , though ? -- ish , brief-ish . </s>
Well , the one thing , and I was just going to make one point here which is I actually agree with our opponents here . I do think nuclear and natural gas are part of the solution . </s>
What we haven’t spoken about tonight is actually the importance of having efficient , appropriate long-term transparent government policies to get us there . So if we are going to have an economic recovery that’s going to be fueled by clean energy , we’ve got to have the appropriate government policies in place to get us there in the most efficient and the cheapest manner . Okay , Steven Hayward . Yeah , the question I was trying to address in my opening remarks -- that it’s one thing to be told that it’s necessary to do this ; it’s another thing to be told , as the motion does tonight , that it will make us richer to do so . Here is the blunt problem though . </s>
The International Energy Agency a couple years ago put out an assessment and they caught hell for it because what it said was the United States and European countries could disappear off the face of the earth tomorrow , which means their emissions would go to zero , and the growth in emissions of fossil fuel use of the developing world will make up for all of our emissions in about 15 years , which means if you can’t solve the problem globally , it doesn’t matter what we do . </s>
That’s why I like to say the problem is so much bigger , whatever your view on the climate question is , you can accept the catastrophic view and , in fact , that makes it so much bigger than all the piddly things we’ve been talking about with Waxman-Markey or even incremental improvements and efficiency in this country . That’s a sobering answer for you . </s>
Question down in the front row . I think Kassia just hit the core of this resolution and the difference between the two sides perhaps . A government policy , which to me is code for subsidies , which were only obliquely discussed earlier , so if we return to that subject and if indeed clean energy by any definition is technologically achievable , economically achievable , what kind of government policy is necessary , slash subsidy , and why can it not be left to the market ? Bill Ritter . So there are three things that the government policy can include : a public strategy that helps invest in the innovation -- that can be a part of it . </s>
And government policy can certainly be helping think about ways that there are financial instruments . And there are instruments apart from subsides that also lead to investment . There’re a variety of things municipal governments can do , state governments can do that are financial mechanisms . </s>
And so , if you have the technology and you have the finance in place , then you look at sort of the other policies that might spur the kind of innovation , and that was our experience in Colorado , that our renewable energy standard absolutely made a significant difference in jobs coming to the state because there was a market certainty . Steven Hayward . I don’t know where to begin . I mean , Governor , if a 20 percent renewable standard are good , why not 50 percent ? Well , we went to 30 , and we went to 30 with a two percent rate cap . </s>
Well , why not 50 ? Well , because we couldn’t get the coalition of people that I believe were necessary for us to do it to make a wise policy -- And cause was not a consideration at all ? </s>
We got to 30 with a two percent rate cap , that’s a pretty good thing to be , the second most aggressive renewable energy standard and to do that with people at the table agreeing that it was possible and achievable . </s>
But your utilities are agreeing why ? Because there was a pass-through cost to their rate payers . That’s the interesting thing about all the subsidies that are being discussed now is that -- I take the questioners point is directly on point here . I’m all for renewable , but why can’t they exist on their own . Why do they need my tax dollars ? </s>
Why do they need everyone else’s tax dollars ? Well , with the rate cap -- I mean , our history of price controls is real successful . </s>
Yeah , I mean , I went to bat for the natural gas industry when they were going to remove the tax credit for intangible drilling costs . You’ve written about that . So there’s subsides . There are big subsidies out there , but the fact of the matter is we did this with a two percent rate cap and , in fact -- somebody referenced a story that said we’ve had this kind of inflation in our energy costs , a Denver Post story that went and looked at this , said the biggest increase in cost came from the opening of a new coal plant , not from renewable resources being at 30 percent renewable by 2020 . </s>
Okay , well , fair enough . </s>
Would you agree then to -- </s>
Well , that wasn’t mentioned in your -- that’s fair enough , but you didn’t mention it . Okay , so would you agree then , fair field , eliminate all subsidies ? Fair field , no favor ? The oil and gas tax preferences amount to $ 4.4 billion per year . Ethanol alone gets $ 16 billion . </s>
I’m not a fan of ethanol . Okay , fair enough , but would you support fair field , no favor -- Actually , I’ve got a point here I’d like to make . Kassia Yanosek . </s>
And this is a very important question . </s>
I think that what we haven’t seen enough of in this country is enough policies that actually pool technologies into the marketplace . We’ve seen a lot push . Well you need some of the push because you actually need to be developing the end market so that you have the development of the turbines and the solar panels who actually sell into a big market , but I absolutely think that the pool of technologies is the most important thing that we need to be focusing on . That could be through a carbon price , a tax or just some sort of price on carbon . </s>
I think the clean energy standard , and certainly a federal one is certainly a good way to go rather than the patchwork of state policies that make investors , I think , very concerned because we don’t -- we’d like to see a big federal approach so that we have an easier time in putting our money to work . Steven Hayward , final word for you . Yeah , this is the price on carbon question , that comes up a lot . I actually did a paper with a Tufts economist a few years ago on what a $ 15 a ton price on carbon would get you . </s>
We thought about a 10 percent reduction in CO2 emissions , not a lot , but something . </s>
But here’s the problem with the idea of the price on carbon . </s>
You know , Europe has had a big price on carbon for a long time . They’ve had high fuel taxes for decades as a -- strictly as a revenue measure . It later became an environmental measure . You know , so their equivalent price of gas is as high as $ 8 a gallon in some countries and their utility rates are much higher than ours and yet even with those high prices you don’t see any breakthrough in green clean energy technologies in Europe . </s>
Their numbers are about the same as ours . If the price on carbon incentivised the market you’d see a lot more going on in Europe than we do . And that concludes round two of our debate . And here’s where we are . We’re about to hear brief closing statements from each debater . </s>
They will be two minutes each , and this is their last chance to change your minds . Remember you voted before the debate and we’re going to ask you to vote once again right after their closing statements . And the team that has changed the most of your minds will be declared our winner . </s>
So round three closing statements , each debater in turn . Our motion is `` Clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery . '' </s>
Here to summarize his position against the motion , Steven Hayward , F. K. Weyerhaeuser Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and author of the `` Almanac for Environmental Trends . '' Thank you , John . Remember that the motion tonight is directed not at whether we think clean energy however defined is a good thing , or a necessary thing , but whether clean energy can be the sector that will lead this country out of what we’re still calling the great recession . Now I wish we could talk more about this . If you mandate or subsidize something of course you’ll create jobs and if the government spends lots of money on something , you will create jobs . </s>
That’s why we do defense spending because it’s necessary and if you have a defense plant in your area of course you create lots of jobs . </s>
But of course if we thought just the government spending money on things was the answer to prosperity we would never cut the defense budget after a war . </s>
The reason we build prisons , because it’s necessary . And there’s lots more demand for prisons unfortunately in this country , but no one thinks that , that is the path to prosperity , even though it creates jobs . </s>
The question does it create net new jobs across the economy , does it add value where value doesn’t currently exist . The light bulbs up here really don’t discriminate what kind of electron it comes from . </s>
Electrons are all the same , these lights don’t care whether it’s from a coal fire powered plant or natural gas or a windmill except when the windmill is not turning . A problem we haven’t talked about a lot is the reliability of many forms of clean energy . I can not think ever of a sector of the economy that led us out of a recession because the government mandated that we buy the product . And I could spend a lot of time talking about some of the important things that have been pointed to like the Internet , jet turbine engines which were the result of government research , but not mandates that the public buy them . </s>
I think for all these reasons the sign behind us says think twice , I think you should think twice about letting sentimental slogans do our thinking for us rather than the hard headed reality of the energy world . Thank you . Thank you , Steven Hayward . Kassia , do I pronounce your firm , `` Tana '' ? Tana . </s>
Tana , okay , I just wanted to be correct , because you were a late entry I didn’t get pronunciations on all this . And thank you again for filling in , it was terrific that you did this . Our motion is clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery and here to summarize for the motion , Kassia Yanosek , founding principal of Tana Energy Capital and cofounder of the U.S. Partnership for Renewable Energy Finance . Well I’d like to summarize tonight by saying first of all our opposing side has done us a great benefit tonight . They’ve said that they’re bullish on solar , that natural gas is clean , that Apple is a great example of a company that has innovated here but manufactures their products abroad in China . </s>
And all of those points help us because essentially they’re saying that they agree with us , that the clean energy economy will help to grow our economy and get us into a state of recovery . I’d also like to bring it back to why I’m here tonight . I’m not an environmentalist ; I don’t like bats and birds . I like making money and I wouldn’t be here talking about the importance of clean energy if I didn’t think that there was an opportunity for investors and consumers to improve our state by either making money or reducing our costs of consuming energy . </s>
We’ve talked about subsidies ; we 've talked about how subsidies in the United States help dirty and clean energy . We 've been in agreement that we 're seeing costs come down the cost curve for many clean energy technologies , whether it be batteries for electric vehicles , or solar energy . </s>
And we 've also agreed here that , you know , oil price spikes are n't great . And therefore , we need to be expanding our energy options into a variety of different fuels , clean and dirty , and make them cleaner . So , I would just finalize here , my points , by saying , I think that we need to be focusing on what 's actually going to be getting us into this next stage of growing our economy . And we 're already doing that . We 're already seeing energy technology move to a place where , we saw IT and Biotech 10 , 20 , 30 years ago . </s>
And it 's about focusing on the technology , focusing on the smart policies that actually promote energy innovation , and promote pooling technologies and having them compete with one another . And finally , it 's about policies that actually bring finance into the , into this industry . And leverage -- Thank you , Kassia your time 's up . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Thank you . Our motion is “Clean energy can drive America 's economic recovery.” </s>
Here to summarize his position against the motion , Robert Bryce , author of “Power Hungry : The Myths of Green Energy and the Real Fuels of the Future.” Recall the motion . “Clean energy can drive America 's economic recovery.” </s>
The key word there is “drive , ” that this is going to be the catalyst for the economic recovery . Energy transitions , like it or not , happen over decades , or even centuries , not years . And that economic recovery , the implied timeline here is maybe a half-decade ? Steve and I have repeatedly shown that this “clean energy” term is so vague as to be meaningless . That 's one reason why you should vote against this motion . </s>
In 1974 , Richard Nixon promised that we would be energy independent in six years . Today , we import a lot of foreign oil . We 've been an importer of foreign oil since 1908 , a net crude oil importer since 1908 . Now , we hear President Obama saying 80 percent of our electricity will be clean energy by the year 2035 . </s>
We did n't get energy independence , and we wo n't meet this goal of 80 percent of our electricity from clean energy by 2035 either . Because it is such a nebulous idea . If everything is clean energy , then nothing is . Look at the latest numbers from the EIA . Today we produce about 50 percent of our electricity from coal . </s>
Their latest projections are that , by 2035 , coal will still be providing about 40 percent of our electricity . Why ? </s>
Because of cost . The latest EIA projections also show that by 2035 , coal , oil , and natural gas will be providing 78 percent of our primary energy . That 's only slightly down from 83 percent today . Clean energy wo n't fuel America 's economic recovery , because we do n't know exactly what it means . </s>
Unfortunately , Steve and I ca n't talk about power density , and cost , and scale , in ways that will drive these points home . </s>
It takes physics , it takes math . This issue that we 're hearing , this beating of the drum for clean energy , unfortunately , is just a further cheapening of our political discussion in this country . Rather than having real discussions about energy and energy policy , we 're stuck with yet another slogan , and that will not help our economic recovery at all . </s>
Thank you , Robert Bryce . Thank you . The motion : “Clean energy can drive America 's economic recovery.” And here to summarize his position for the motion , Bill Ritter , director of the Center for the New Energy Economy at Colorado State University , and former governor of Colorado . Thank you . </s>
Thank you very much for your time and your attention tonight . This is a debate that 's far more important than any kind of political slogan , or any kind of politicking . This is a debate that I think has everything to do with the economic future of this state , this country , and quite frankly , the future for our kids and our grandkids . And people who think that Americans do n't care what kind of power source delivers electricity through a light bulb are wrong about that . Everything that I 've seen , in terms of public opinion polling , says that Americans absolutely do care that we make investments in clean energy . </s>
Why do they care about it ? They care about it because they believe that , in this place , America , that we are inventors , that we are creators . You can look at costs and say , “Costs of this , and that 's why coal will be , going forward , 40 percent of our energy.” That 's a static view of the world . </s>
It does n't take into account the tremendous cost curve reductions that we 've seen in a variety of places that are absolutely non-carbon sources of energy , solar , wind , and things of that nature . And , quite frankly , Americans believe in the star of innovation and creation , and say , “Yeah , we can do it.” We can do it with the right set of policies . And we 're not here defending every subsidy and saying it has to happen this way , in a subsidized way . </s>
What we 're saying is , if you put the right set of policies in place to support taxing -- sorry -- financing , technology , and those things that help bring technologies forward and move them forward , then you get to a place where you can see a vision for a clean energy economy that can be part of this economic recovery . States across the country have seen job growth because they committed investments and innovation . They committed policy to this , and they’ve seen job growth in this sector and no other sector . And that’s just one laboratory . </s>
If we did it at the federal level and we did it as a nation , we would see economic recovery in this sector even in the place where we’re slow to recover in a variety of other sectors because it’s a global market and a global demand . Thank you . Bill Ritter , thank you . </s>
And that concludes our closing statements . And now it’s time to learn which side has argued best . We’re asking you again to go to the keypads at your seat that will register your vote . Our motion is “Clean energy can drive America’s economic recovery.” If you agree with the motion , having heard the arguments , press number one . </s>
If you disagree , press number two . If you are or became undecided , push number three . And we will have the results in just a minute . And also , in San Francisco and in Washington , D.C. , our observers there are also registering their vote , and we’re going to report both results tonight . </s>
So , before we get to the results which will only take about a minute , a few things I want to take care of . First of all , I would really like to -- I’ve already thanked you personally , Kassia , but I’d like to thank all four of our panelists for coming here , really bringing their game today . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , all of you . And tonight was one of those nights when the questions from the audience members were actually terrific and on point no matter what kind of hat you’re wearing . </s>
I want to thank all of the people who got up and asked questions because it’s not that easy to do . And a special thank you goes out to the American Clean Skies Foundation for helping to underwrite this season of debates . And again , thank you Greg Staples . </s>
And what this season is about is a theme that we call “America’s House Divided , ” and our next debate will be Tuesday , April 5 . </s>
The motion then , “It’s time to clip America’s global wings.” Arguing for the motion , we have Peter Galbraith , the U.N.’s deputy special representative for Afghanistan in 2009 , the first U.S. ambassador to Croatia as well where he was actively involved in the Bosnia and Croatia peace process . </s>
Joining him as his teammate is Lawrence Korb and assistant secretary of Defense under Ronald Reagan , Korb was once in charge of administering 70 percent of the defense budget . He is currently a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress . </s>
Arguing against the motion are Elliott Abrams , a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who held positions in the Reagan administration and the George W. Bush administration where he was deputy national security adviser in charge of Middle Eastern affairs . His partner will be Elliot Cohen . We have a double Elliot coming up , and that’s very rare . He’s a professor at -- I was once on a shoot for ABC News in Romania , and I was joined by three ABC colleagues . All came from different countries . </s>
We all converged there , and all three of them were named Bruno . </s>
Now that is rare . Eliot Cohen is professor of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins who , despite taking the Bush administration to task over its handling of the Iraq war , served as counselor at the Department of State . Tickets are available for those debates , for that debate and others following through our Web site and at the Skirball box office . And you can also follow Intelligence Squared U.S. on Twitter . </s>
And make sure to become a fan on Facebook to receive a discount on upcoming debates . And actually , this entire debate was streamed live on Facebook tonight . This is the first time that we’ve done that . Also , all of our debates , as we’ve said before , can be heard on NPR stations across the country , and you can watch the debates on the Bloomberg Television Network starting next Monday at 9pm . Visit Bloomberg.com </s>
to find your local channel . So I’m just waiting for the results to come . </s>
They’re probably taking a little bit longer because of the D.C. and San Francisco votes . And since I mentioned Charles Ferguson earlier , Oscar winner , I don’t know if you’re actually here because I never saw you . Are you here , Charles ? Can you just shout yes ? I am . </s>
You are . </s>
I just want to again -- Congratulations to you . And an interesting little fact , my son who’s a 14-year-old eighth grader , got extra credit for going to see your movie and showing up at school with the ticket stub . So , as his father , I’m glad that I could contribute a little bit to your income on that , but congratulations to you . Now , Dana , do we have word from -- why don’t we announce the hall vote and then afterwards I can announce the D.C. and San Francisco vote . That’s going to embarrass her a great deal . </s>
All right , well , talk to your neighbor . Here it comes . Here comes the vote . </s>
All right , so , we didn’t actually hear back from San Francisco . I’m not sure what’s happening out there . </s>
So here are the -- I just want to do the math here . It’s pretty close in D.C . Okay , so , in Washington , here are the results before the debate : 52 percent were for the motion , 14 percent were against , and 34 percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , 46 percent are for the motion , 23 percent are against , and 31 percent undecided . As I see it , the “against” side won in Washington by moving the number nine percent versus the “for” side’s moving at eight percent . So , in Washington -- so congratulations to them . All right , here is the final result then from all of you in the hall who have voted twice now on the topic and motion and the arguments that you have heard . </s>
Before the debate , 46 percent were for the motion , 21 percent against , and 33 percent undecided . After the debate , 43 percent are “for” -- that’s down three percent . 47 percent are “against” -- that’s up 26 percent , and 10 percent remain undecided . The team arguing against the motion , “Clean energy can drive America’s recovery , ” has carried the debate . </s>
Our congratulations to them , and thank you from me , John Donvan , at Intelligence Squared U.S . Intelligence Squared exists because of the efforts of Robert Rosenkranz , who brought it to the United States and has made this thing grow and spread . And it 's been a terrific effort . And tonight it 's a feather in his cap and our cap . So ladies and gentlemen , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Thank you , and welcome . We 're so pleased to be here in Chicago and proud to be a partner with the first Chicago Ideas Week . My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate , to outline the reasons we felt it was worth having . </s>
Tonight 's motion is so counterintuitive one might wonder why we chose it as a topic . After all , there seems to be ample statistical support for the value of a college education . College graduates earn about $ 20,000 a year more than high school graduates , nearly half a million dollars over their lifetimes . Some 9.7 percent of high school graduates are currently unemployed compared with 4.2 percent of college graduates . So going to high school and not college doubles your chance of being unemployed . </s>
In a rapidly changing global economy , many of the traditionally high-paid jobs in manufacturing that high school graduates could get are gone forever . And employers are looking for the kind of cognitive skills that we normally associate with college graduates . And turning from material considerations , a liberal arts education is likely to produce a superior electorate , a more vital civil society , a citizenry with better understanding of American ideals and better ability to adapt to changing circumstances . And on a more personal level , a Chicago reporter asked me how I , transcending an obscure family background through scholarships to Yale and Harvard Law School , could possibly entertain tonight 's motion . So what is the counter argument ? </s>
It is that only a small percentage of high school graduates actually have the aptitudes to do well with colleges of reasonable quality . The majority of those enrolling in college lack the basic skills and aptitudes to take pleasure in the experience or otherwise to succeed . For such students , college becomes an extended adolescence and at best a remediation for inadequate high schools . But not a grounding of the essentials of cultural intelligence and such basic skills as expository writing or quantitative reasoning or scientific method or primary research . </s>
Might not such students get more from vocationally oriented education of the sort they would likely receive in such successful economies as Germany and Switzerland ? </s>
In those countries , by the way , only about 20 percent or so complete four-year degree programs compared with double that figure in the U.S . And for the students at the very top of the scale , at the most elite colleges , might college prove an impediment to creative thinking or a distraction from their entrepreneurial drive ? What lessons might we take from the extraordinary contributions of such college dropouts as Bill Gates , Mark Zuckerberg , Larry Ellison and Steve Jobs ? </s>
Well , your role tonight is to listen to the arguments , to question the panelists and ultimately to decide which side was more persuasive . Whatever you decide , I hope you will come away with the sense that on this issue , like so many others that seem at first blush to be one-sided , that there is an intellectually respectable position on both sides of the debate . And with that hope , I turn the evening over to our moderator John Donvan and this extraordinary panel of experts gathered for our first live debate in Chicago . Thank you , John . Thank you , Robert . </s>
And may I just invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz for making this possible . True or false : Too many kids go to college ? That 's what we 're here to debate , another verbal joust from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan from ABC News . We are at Venue Six10 at the Spertus Center in Chicago . </s>
Too many kids go to college . </s>
Two teams will argue that proposition from opposite sides , for it and against it . All of our debaters come to this from different perspectives , all of them are trying to win you over because you , our live audience , will act as the judges . And only one side will win . So let 's meet our panelist of debaters . </s>
The motion being , `` Too many kids go to college . '' The team arguing for the motion include tech entrepreneur , investor and philanthropist , Paypal cofounder , Peter Thiel . </s>
His teammate is a political scientist who sees the Bachelor of Arts degree as a source of class division . American Enterprise Institute scholar , Charles Murray . Opposing them at the facing table and arguing that it 's not true that too many kids go to college , one of Northwestern University 's most transformative leaders , president emeritus , Henry Bienen . And joining him , an entrepreneur turned academic , he is also a columnist for the Washington Post , Vivek Wadhwa . So this is a contest . </s>
It 's a debate . </s>
One side will win , and one side will lose . And you , our live audience , will hear them debate for three rounds , and then you will choose the winner by voting once before the debate and once again after the debate . </s>
So let 's go to the first debate now . If you go to the key pads on your seats , only pay attention because on the right hand side is the one that 's relevant to you . Pay attention only to keys number one , two and three . </s>
The others are irrelevant . If you agree with the motion that too many kids go to college , if , at this point , you agree with the side -- this side that 's arguing that point of view , push number one . And if you disagree with this side , push number two . </s>
And if you 're undecided , push number three . And if you think you made a mistake , just correct it , and the system will lock in your last vote . So remember , we have three rounds of debate . </s>
After the third round of debate , we ask you to vote again , to tell us who you think presented the best argument . </s>
And the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner . So on to round one , opening statements by each debater in turn . They are seven minutes each . These statements are uninterrupted . </s>
Our motion is `` Too many kids go to college . '' And speaking first for the motion , I 'd like to introduce Peter Thiel who is making his way to the lectern . Peter Thiel changed our world and the way we do business by cofounding PayPal . He is the creator of that online payment system as well as an early investor in Facebook . </s>
You have now , Peter , stunned the world with your -- with your decision to offer grants of a $ 100,000 to people under 20 who forego college at least for a time to take on some sort of entrepreneurial task , which is going how ? Just got started , but we selected 24 students for the first two-year cohort . And they 've been starting over the last month or two , and it 's off to a really great start . All right , sir . </s>
A bit awkward fact , Peter Thiel himself , Stanford 1989 . </s>
1989 . </s>
BA in philosophy . 1992 , law degree , Stanford University . That is correct . I 'm going to start with that fact , actually , but yes , that is very true . </s>
We 're going to be looking for an explanation . Ladies and gentlemen , Peter Thiel . Thank you . </s>
Let me actually just start with that question . </s>
You know , I went to Stanford undergrad , Stanford law school . Throughout the '90s , I had a belief that education was absolutely paramount . We should only hire people that went to the best schools . And - - and we discriminated on this basis very aggressively in hiring at PayPal . </s>
And I use this - - and I used to -- I thought this was the most important thing in our society . And over the last four or five years , I 've gradually come to shift my views on it for a number of different reasons . The narrow technology context in Silicon Valley , that I saw so many very talented people who had not gone through college tracks and who had still done extraordinary well . In some ways , they were also more creative . They were not laden down with enormous college debt that was somehow forcing people to take better paying jobs that were more munitive but more boring , and track them into things that were not as interesting or important , that were discouraging people from doing things in nonprofit work or on the more entrepreneurial side . </s>
And this has become a more and more acute issue over the years because unlike the time when I went to college , the cost has gone up tremendously . The amount of debt that people leave college with have gone up tremendously . And so the choices are very different from the ones people had 25 years ago . College costs in nominal dollars have gone up by more than a factor of 10 since 1980 . Even after inflation , it 's gone up by 300 percent . </s>
Costs about four times as much . </s>
Inflation adjusted to go to college now as it did 30 years ago , it 's gone up more than anything else in our society , more than health care , more than housing , more than any of a number of other things we think of as having been subject to runaway cost inflation and escalation . And as I looked outside of just the narrow Silicon Valley entrepreneurial context I 've come to believe that the problem is much broader , it 's not just the most talented people who are perhaps being misdirected and encouraged to go on a very narrow tracked career , but that this is a broader problem and that we are in fact experiencing something of a bubble in education , a bubble that is as pernicious as the bubbles we had in technology in the '90s and housing in the 2000s , and like those two other bubbles is characterized by two things , number one , runaway costs where people are paying more and more for something where the quality has n't gone up -- in the '90s it was tech stocks , in the 2000s it was housing -- education , I 'm not saying it 's worse than it was 30 years ago but I do n't think it 's gotten much better , and secondly by an incredible psychosocial dynamic where you can not question it . And in '99 in Silicon Valley you could n't question the NASDAQ valuations , and in 2005 you could not question people buying houses , it was strictly taboo and forbidden , and in the same way this is the one thing people still really believe in our society . And to question the value of education is like questioning existence of Santa Claus with three- year-old kids or something like that . And while we 're not trying to scare the children here or anything like that , we do think that we can not afford to have a third bubble in this country . </s>
We had two already . They were catastrophically bad . They led to enormous misallocation of resources . And when we look at education more carefully there are a lot of worrisome signs . Student debts at this point total over a trillion dollars , and when you look at how well people are doing who come out of college , they are still doing pretty well , they 're still doing better than they used to , but the outperformance has been going down , and going down since about 2000 . </s>
And , you know , the law school context I 'm quite familiar with , there are about 50,000 people a year who graduate from law school in the U.S. , there only are 30,000 legal jobs available in the U.S. and I would argue we have maybe too many lawyers as is , but we 're producing way more for a society that probably already has too many . The median wage for lawyers is 62,000 which is n't that great considering that you 've taken on another quarter million in law school debt typically . Pre-med , only about nine percent of the people who study pre-med have slots available to them in medical school . </s>
The other 91 percent are wasting their time , and somebody should have told them that their freshman or sophomore year and not waited till their senior year or several years of post college to figure that sort of stuff out . If you broaden the ambit more generally , there 's something like 17 million people in the labor force who have college degrees and are basically doing unskilled work or find the narrow and extreme statistics , there 's something like 6,100 people in the U.S. who have Ph.D.s and are doing janitorial work . </s>
And so when we say that education is important and paramount , that is true but it can also be a distortion and it can be a distraction from some of the very real problems we have as a society . We need to figure out how do we create more jobs , how do we create more good paying jobs . </s>
We do n't have enough of either in our society . And while education is linked to them , it 's not this absolute thing . And we want to question this notion that education is an absolute good or an absolute necessity . And in fact when people say as our opponents do that it is an absolute good or an absolute necessity , you start ignoring all these problematic facts , you start making a lot of catastrophic approximations that abound . And that 's what we want to sort of push back a little bit . </s>
Let me say one thing that we 're not arguing for . We 're not saying that nobody should go to college . We 're not saying that college is categorically a bad thing . </s>
We 're not saying everybody should drop out . We 're simply saying that too many people are going to college , just like too many people are buying houses and too many tech companies were going public in the late '90s , does n't mean there should be no tech companies or no houses , it does n't mean we should shut down all the colleges , but we should n't -- we need to make this a much more careful deliberate choice . And what we are hoping to start with this discussion and debate today is a discussion that would encourage all of you to think more about your future . Do not think of education as something that 's an automatic ticket to the future , you need to think about it yourself . </s>
If I had to do something over again , having gone to Stanford , I probably would still go to college even with the higher costs , if I did n't have any great ideas of what to do instead I 'd probably still do the exact same thing as I did in the late '80s even with all the problems . But one thing I would try to do very differently is not accept the answer that this was the automatic thing , that this was the thing you should do without thinking , I would have tried to think about what I want to do with my life as a senior in high school and a senior in college and not simply have more education be the automatic default answer for everything . The question we want to push the other side back on a little bit is if education is an absolute good or absolute necessity , who is accountable if it is a mistake ? And if these people are taking on these enormous debts are getting it wrong , where can they go to get a refund ? Peter Thiel , your time is up . </s>
Thank you very much . Our motion is `` Too many kids go to college.” And here to speak against the motion , Henry Bienen . He is president emeritus of Northwestern University . </s>
And Henry , in the nearly 15 years that you were there , the university’s success really was and is recognized as your success during those 15 years . The school increased its endowment 15 times . The sports team won more titles . </s>
Applications skyrocketed . </s>
You launched a Center for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self-Assembly . </s>
Let Harvard eat that , right . </s>
But you know these guys at the other side are saying that you’re a denizen of the system that they say is in a bubble . So you’re going to need to impress them . </s>
It’s a joint effort to make a great university . </s>
Thank you for that , John . It took a lot of people working hard . </s>
Henry Bienen . Thank you . Ladies and gentlemen . </s>
Well , thank you all for being here , especially Mayor Emanuel . Thank you for coming . </s>
You gave a great speech this morning on the budget . This is an important debate . </s>
It’s about the American dream . </s>
It’s about social mobility and American democracy . Because the answer to the question as to whether too many kids go to college is fundamentally about what kind of a society we hope to create . </s>
I care deeply about this issue . I’m an educator , 28 years at Princeton , 14.5 years as Northwestern’s president , now chair of a proprietary for-profit college , Rasmussen College , and a member of the Board of Education , appointed by the mayor for the Chicago Public School System . Sure , some dropouts make it big . But social and economic policy should be informed by data and analysis , not anecdotal individual life histories , no matter how compelling . Most people are not Bill Gates or Steve Jobs . </s>
We should not misread particular circumstances at particular moments in time as an indication of likely long outcomes . As Damon Runyon once said , “The race is not always to the swift nor the battle to the strong , but that’s how the smart money bets.” </s>
The argument that too many people are going to college is not new . In his youth , Richard Freeman , a Harvard economist , argued this in “The Overeducated American” in 1976 . </s>
He was wrong then , and our opponents are wrong now . And by the way , he’s changed his mind . We now have studies and lots of information . Mr. Rosenkranz alluded to some of them , which should persuade anyone with an open mind that more years of school , post-secondary , are positively correlated with earning over one’s lifetime , and also correlated with lower rates of unemployment and shorter duration being unemployed when a higher degree is not obtained . </s>
4.3 percent of college graduates are unemployed . More than triple that number of high school students or high school dropouts are unemployed . This is very compelling . There’s a clear wage premium to education . There’s also a social premium to society , not just individual . </s>
Society benefits through greater productivity , lower crime , better health , better citizenship for more educated people . And the wage premium to education has been growing since the 1980s , not shrinking . The question to be decided is whether it’s true that too many kids go to college . Fact : In 2010 , about 66 percent of the United States population between 25 and 30 had some college experience . The rest were high school grads or high school dropouts . </s>
It’s hardly the case that everyone or too many are pouring into college . </s>
We need more , not fewer , college graduates . </s>
Going to college in the United States , by the way , means very different things . From two-year community colleges , flagship public research universities , small denominational colleges , elite privates , and for- profits . By the way , at the for-profits , the average age of the students is 28 , and these are not kids . Many of them are single mothers . Many are minorities . </s>
They don’t choose to attend such a place for a liberal arts education or because we have great athletic teams or a climbing wall . They come to improve their careers , their income , their life chances , and they do . </s>
In his articles , Mr. Murray argues that too many people are going to college , and I feel he believes in innate qualities . He uses a language like , “He does not have it in him.” But how does he know this ? What measures does he have for a great understanding of cognitive abilities or their impact ? He believes , I think , that abilities are fixed . </s>
It’s a highly stratified view of the world and people’s places in it , and I don’t share it . </s>
True , plenty of people who graduate high school are not college ready . We know this in Chicago . But low college graduation rates and dropout can not be attributed everywhere and completely to individual 's intelligence or competence . </s>
Even some qualified students in high school may not attain to a four-year degree within six to eight years because of their lack of resources which compels them to leave and drop out . No doubt , some people do n't have the smarts or the personality skills to succeed . But for many , their environment at pre-college school systems have played a big role in not preparing them . We should not be so ready to consign them to what Mr. Murray may feel is their fate . Neither they nor our society will benefit from pushing them into what , for many will be low-level jobs . </s>
Because for every college degree holder who is a janitor or a waitress , there are thousands of times janitors and waitresses who are high school dropouts . Mr. Thiel has acknowledged a correlation in his own writings between college attendance and higher income . But he doubts the direction of causation . </s>
That is , college may pay off for some people because smarter people go to it . In my view , whatever the direction of causation , you can learn skills at college and improve your life chances . And by the way , we have lots of studies , including studies of twins that Allen Kruger and others have done which shows you can isolate the college experience itself among all the other variables which count . </s>
And college does make a difference . </s>
Now , high school vocational alternatives are there , but they 're not widely regarded as -- they 're widely regarded as second best by the general public . Polls show that most Americans agree that everyone does not need to go to college . They support alternatives for other people 's children . </s>
I wonder if those in favor of the proposition want their own children or relatives to not go to college . Mr. Thiel , Mr. Murray , I know Mr. Thiel has started this fund , and I applaud his generosity . It is very generous . </s>
Will he fund tens of thousands , millions ? All the trend lines show a shift in the U.S. economy and its labor force towards more people requiring post secondary education because growth industries require post secondary education . We 've hollowed out industrial jobs . The clear way to premium for college graduates is growing . </s>
It skyrocketed in the 1980s and 1990s . Advanced degree holders did vastly better , and their advantage continues to hold up . </s>
And by the way , for women , that wage premium is even higher than for men . I need to conclude , but I want to conclude by saying there are not many alternatives in the U.S. We do n't have a vocational system like Switzerland or Germany . I 'm not against building such a vocational system . I 'd like to see more tracks that people can go to . But what we really need to do is do better in pre-K through 12 . </s>
We can not accept that too many kids go to college . In summary , those who go beyond secondary school are -- not all kids . There are not too many of them . </s>
I 'm not willing to consign them to low-level jobs . We need to do better , and we ca n't give up on the American dream . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Henry Bienen . So a reminder of what 's going on . We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan . </s>
We have two teams of two members each arguing out over this motion : `` Too many kids go to college . '' You have heard the first two speakers , and now onto the third . Charles Murray is the W.H . Brady scholar at the American Enterprise Institute . And Charles , you rather famously said that it was thanks to an SAT exam in 1961 and your fabulous score that you were able to get out of a small town in Iowa . </s>
That 's what I thought at the time . And into Harvard . </s>
Well , I want to come back to that because -- so you went Harvard . You did well in the liberal arts environment . </s>
Then you kind of moved onto the conservative arts , and you -- A trend setter in terms of thought on issues such as welfare where your writings had impact on policy . Your book , `` The Bell Curve '' despised by the left , and you like that . And I want to know where you are now on the SATs that got you out of Iowa . </s>
Oh , I now recommend that we abolish the SAT , because it turns out that if they give an achievement test , I probably would have gotten into Harvard that way too . And the SAT , as it now exists , has taken on a really bad number . Ladies and gentlemen , Charles Murray . I think we better get the topic straight . </s>
When I agreed to debate on too many kids are going to college , I thought of college as being four-year colleges leading to the BA . I did n't think of it as a whole range of community colleges and the rest . </s>
Anyway , that 's the way I 'm going to argue tonight because if the proposition were that too many kids are trying to get more education and training after high school , I would n't have accepted the position on the affirmative . Almost everybody needs more education after high school . What they do n't need is to chase after this fraudulent , destructive , antediluvian thing called a BA . The thesis of my argument really is that the BA is the work of the devil . Let 's go through each of those accusations . </s>
First , fraudulent . The BA is supposed to signify , in a very old-fashioned term , that you are an educated man , now -- an educated person . You know and I know that it does n't represent that any more . </s>
The number of colleges that require the core courses that 's go into a liberal education is virtually not -- do n't exist . But it 's much worse than that . If the only thing you know about a person is that that person has a BA , you do n't know anything . If that seems too extreme , I can document all kinds of stories about courses in introductory economics which use magazine articles as the text about students who get a BA after four years without having to write a single solitary term paper , about exam scores which , by any traditional grading system means a D or an F. But guess what ? </s>
They 're transmuted into Bs . And why are they transmuted into Bs ? Because the story they want -- have now is retention , whereby the point of a college is to bring in as much tuition money as you can . And you 've got to retain kids . And in fact , if they want to drop out of courses and stay for five or six years instead of four , that 's just fine with the college . </s>
You can talk to employers all over the country who will tell you about applicants who have BAs , who ca n't write grammatical sentences in their applications and sometimes ca n't read very well . </s>
All of these things do not refer to the products of a few diploma mills . I am talking about large chunks of the second tier and third tier state college and university systems . And I 'm also talking about large numbers of courses and students in the first tier system and a whole lot of very expensive elite colleges . Knowing what major a person had does n't tell you very much . Yeah , if it 's math , if it 's hard sciences , if it 's engineering , okay . </s>
But what does it mean if you have a political science degree , spoken by a person who has a political science degree , if you 're going to an employer and saying you ought to hire me . It does n't really mean anything . Now , here is what you do know about a person with a BA if you know what school they came from . </s>
So if the applicant came from Harvard , you know a whole lot about what person was like at age 18 before he went to college . </s>
You know he had terrific SAT scores , and you know he had a terrific high school record or he would n't have gotten in . You do n't know anything about what Harvard has added . And as a graduate of that institution , trust me , I am living proof of that statement in a whole bunch of ways . None of this should be news to any of you . </s>
The retreat of the academy from rigorous education is known to everybody who 's in higher education . Except for majors in engineering and math and the hard sciences which account for just 12 percent of undergraduates , the bachelor 's degree , all by itself , is meaningless . Okay , destructive . Even though we know that the BA is substantively meaningless , it remains true that for millions of jobs you ca n't get a job interview unless you have one . And the problem is that employers are behaving rationally when they do that because you 've got about 32 percent of adults that have a BA . </s>
The employers know how clueless many of them are . </s>
Why should they go outside that pool and take even lower levels of population in terms of their ability . So they 're being rational . </s>
But the problem is this : We have created a kind of self- fulfilling prophecy . We have created a culture in which not having a BA labels you , in the minds of way too many people , as being either dumb or lazy . And so a lot of ambitious kids who have no interest in sitting in classrooms for four years and accumulating these large student loan debts , nonetheless want the piece of paper . It is not surprising that we have all the horror stories which are documented in journal articles and large surveys , not anecdotally , of kids who take the easiest possible classes and do n't study . </s>
They are n't there to get an education . They 're there to get a piece of paper . It is hugely destructive to have created this kind of false credential . It is destructive to the majority of young people who do n't try to go to college because they know college is not for them . </s>
It is destructive for about 40 percent of those who start college who never finish . But most of all it is destructive to America 's civic culture . We have always prided ourselves upon the idea that everybody is equal in all the ways that count with regard to human dignity . We have given a meaningless educational credential a role in our culture that says otherwise . Antediluvian . </s>
I have time just to state the proposition and hope to have a chance to elaborate later , the four-year brick and mortar college is obsolete . </s>
Four years is almost always too long . There 's hardly any profession that requires four years of class work . A lot of them require an apprenticeship much longer than that . </s>
The rationale for a big physical plant at a residential college is just vanishing . </s>
What 's the rationale for having a library these days ? It used to be central . Why should it be that the brilliant professor giving a lecture where he does n't take any individual relationships with students but just giving a superb lecture , why is he giving that lecture to 150 kids who happen to be sitting in the hall , why is n't it being given to millions ? </s>
Distance education has all sorts of possibilities it did n't have before . </s>
The information revolution is giving us a cornucopia of new ways to help kids get an education . Well , that just begins to say what I want to say but what I 'm really coming down to is nobody should go to college as the system is now defined . What we need is a transformation that gives young people a chance to tell employers or for that matter to tell graduate admissions officers what they know and what they can do , not where they learned it and how long it took them . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Charles Murray . Our motion is Too many kids go to college . '' And now to speak against the motion , Vivek Wadhwa . </s>
He is director of research at Duke 's Center for Entrepreneurship . In fact , you have a long list of academic credentials . You have research and teaching positions at Duke and at Emory and at Harvard Law . And what am I missing ? </s>
All right . And Berkeley . And yet you started as an entrepreneur , you 've cofounded and sold successfully two software companies . John , I call myself a tech guy lost in academia . </s>
All right . </s>
That 's the shortest way of describing -- All right . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Vivek Wadhwa . </s>
You know -- -- it must be because I 'm an immigrant , I 'm a tech entrepreneur , I 'm a foreign born , that I have a totally different perspective on this whole debate . </s>
In fact , when I first stepped into it , it was ripping Peter Thiel 's head off in an article I wrote for telling kids to drop out of college because it did n't make sense to me . You know , as an academic for the last six or seven years I 've been researching what 's happening globally . I 've been researching the impact of globalization on U.S. competitiveness . I 've been researching American schools versus other schools , and so on , and what makes America what it is , our competitiveness , immigration , those topics I 've been researching . </s>
And when I step back from that , my conclusion is that these people in America are totally completely out of touch . If you read my writings , you 'll see that I 've been writing very controversial articles , each of them rip into a different aspect of American competitiveness because we do n't get it . We 're sitting here in our own little bubble disconnected from the rest of the world . </s>
Now , let -- I 'm going to give you three perspectives on this . </s>
First of all , about U.S. education itself , believe it or not , U.S. education is by far the best in the world . Everyone is trying to be like us . People from abroad stake their life savings , all the money they can possibly raise and invest it in sending their kids to America because we 've got the best schools . </s>
What do they gain from our schools ? It 's not the courses . It 's really the knowledge . It 's how to learn . You gain social skills . </s>
You learn how to interact with other people . You learn how to deal with failure , make compromises . You learn how to solve problems . </s>
These are sort of things you learn because our schools have a way of making you socialize , making you think , making you compete , and American kids come out the best and the brightest in the world . This is why America is what it is . Now , another argument we 're discussing is well , some kids should n't go to college . Charles has written a lot about IQ , IQ tests being determinants of who will and wo n't succeed in life . </s>
To me that 's complete baloney . My whole life I 've faced stereotypes because I happen to be a race that may not be very smart . In my youth my people were beggars and snake charmers , then we became low level engineers , now we 're hotshot CEOs . In my lifetime I 've seen the transformation of how people perceive me . </s>
So if I was going by these classifications of who should be and who should n't be educated , my people should n't get education because we do n't really deserve it , we 're not going to be successful , therefore , leave us out . </s>
You 'll find the same thing with many other minorities in America . We do n't know . I tell you if -- I know from my own children that they 've gone through gyrations , so trying to decide what they want to be when they grow up . When they were young , they had some ideas . </s>
Now , if I had to decide when my sons were 16 years old , whether they would go to school or not based on their aptitude , it would be the worst decision I could possibly ever make because I’d be wrong . Both of them decided to do completely different things than what they were talking about when they were young . </s>
Children don’t know . So who are we ? </s>
Who are parents to try to figure out whether they should get education or not ? </s>
America is what it is because of our education system . America started educating the masses , and its productivity rose . We became the most fiercely competitive land in the world because we educated everyone . Now there are a lot of people left out as Henry talked about , but the solution to fixing America’s competitiveness is to bring everyone up to educate everyone . Now we can debate what a college is . </s>
To me , a community college is a college . A college -- you know , Peter Thiel basically has lived in this bubble called Silicon Valley where everyone thinks -- when they think college , they think Stanford . </s>
They think Berkeley maybe , so , one level below Stanford , but that’s it . </s>
And when he talks and when he gives all these great talks about education , he talks about $ 200,000 of debt , $ 250,000 of debt . I know some great people who have gone to community colleges who have almost no debt , who worked part time , been able to pay their fees off . Our community colleges in this country are also colleges , and they too are better than the best -- they too are better than the best institutions in most other countries of the world . I don’t know why we keep forgetting that . Now , I also taught , you know , I teach at several universities . </s>
I was at University , and my students brought up Peter Thiel . </s>
He’s quite a legend worldwide now . They were talking -- they said , “Professor , is there really an American investor who’s paying children to drop out of college ? ” I mean , they were so confused . At the end of it , we talked about it , and they said , “You know , this is great because we’re going to eat their lunch.” </s>
This is what they were thinking . They didn’t say it . But this is what’s happening in the world right now . Just as we had these stupid debates about educating our children , the rest of the world has learned our trick . </s>
India and China are now graduating 1.5 million engineers a year . They’re educating all their people because they know that it’s going to make them like America , and they’re going to eat our lunch . </s>
So if we keep having these silly debates about four-year degrees and this and that , we’re going to lose out . You talk about entrepreneurship , again -- again , I have a lot of respect for Peter Thiel while chatting with him , but , you know , he talks about entrepreneurs who can be pulled out of school and be very successful . Fine . There’re 25 , maybe 200 , 2,000 people in America who don’t need to go to college . I have researched this systematically . </s>
What we found was that the difference between entrepreneurs in the tech industry , in the same world that Peter comes from , the difference between entrepreneurs who have a Bachelor’s degree and who have a high school degree is huge , almost two-to-one in terms of revenue and number of employees . In terms of success , that’s how much difference education makes . Now , the interesting thing is what we also learned was that it doesn’t matter what school you graduate from . The tech founders in America , the most successful people in America graduated from a wide assortment of universities . There are almost as many universities as there were entrepreneurs in the research we did . </s>
It didn’t matter whether you graduated from a community college or whether you graduated from Harvard . You could still make it big as an entrepreneur . Why ? Because school gave you that basic foundation to be able to learn . </s>
Now , moving forward , the Indians and Chinese are going to be eating our children’s lunch , guaranteed . I’ve researched it enough to know that we have a lot to worry about . </s>
If we disarm right now and stop teaching them , we’re going to become like they used to be . They are absolutely going to demolish this country . </s>
And what’s going to happen is that globalization is going to wreak havoc on industries . Already we’re talking about manufacturing . We’re talking about several industries now going offshore . It’s going to happen more and more . We’re going to have to keep constantly reeducating our workforce . </s>
Ten years from now , we’re going to have to have massive retraining programs for our workforce . If you don’t even have a Bachelor’s degree , if you don’t even have basic education , you’re beyond hope . </s>
These people may be end up , you know , waiting tables at restaurants , but we’re going to have too many of those . </s>
We need to provide our workforce with a basic education . I say we’d have to have every American getting at least a Bachelor’s degree and encouraging them to do Master’s and Ph.D.s . Thank you , Vivek Wadhwa . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . Remember , we asked you to vote at the beginning of the debate , and we’ll ask you to vote once again at the end . </s>
And the team that has moved its numbers the most will be declared our winner . </s>
So now onto round two , and that’s where the debaters address each other directly and also take questions from you and questions from me . We have heard the arguments . We’re at Venue Six10 at the Spertus Center in Chicago . We have two teams of two arguing this motion , `` Too many kids go to college.” </s>
The team arguing in support of that motion , Peter Thiel and Charles Murray , are arguing that college can be a drag , a waste of time for the very talented and for much of the rest of the students who are pursuing BAs , they are pursuing what has been described as a worthless document , the Bachelor of Arts degree , meaningless document , the Bachelor of Arts degree . </s>
The team on the other side that include Henry Bienen and Vivek Wadhwa are arguing that , number one , going to college is part of the American dream , that those who go to college do better financially and otherwise than those who do not . And from a competitive point of view , we will be falling behind the rest of the world if we accept the notion that we need to limit , in some way , the numbers of people going to college . I want to put a question to the side that 's arguing for the motion and take on that American dream question . And Peter Thiel , I think Henry Bienen used the term , we do grow up with the notion -- I think you 've acknowledged it that in fact you felt straight-jacketed by it , that you do go to college because you 're supposed to go to college . And yet the other side is arguing that that 's part of the dream , part of the American dream . </s>
So take that on , because it 's -- I think that they 're onto something with that . </s>
Well , it certainly was not historically part of the American dream . So if you looked at how many people went to college in the U.S. in the 19th or early 20th century , it was a very , very small percentage . And it was -- this is a very recent phenomenon that this is seen as an absolute necessity . And I think in many ways I would actually flip it around , and I would say , what 's gone wrong with the American dream that we have to have people go to college when that was never a necessity in the past . People do n't need college degrees for many of the jobs that we have . </s>
There are many good jobs where you do n't need them , many bad jobs . People get stuck with college degrees . But I 'd actually flip it around . </s>
This whole question of what sort of a good is college . </s>
Is it an investment in your future ? </s>
I do n't think it 's a good investment because it 's costing too much , and there 's no -- seemingly no accountability whatsoever from the other side on the costs . It was absolute good , any price . </s>
Pay no attention what the price is . Is it a consumption decision ? And I sort of have joked that it 's like a four-year party . And I think that 's kind of true , but I think people are too stressed out to really have a four-year party when they 're taking on a quarter million in debt and know they 're going to be debt slaves for the rest of their lives or for the next 10 , 20 years . And so I think the way to think of it is that it 's basically become an insurance policy because the cracks in our society have become so big . </s>
And we need to be asking why are so many people having to pay more and more for insurance and what 's gone wrong that we 're paying so much for insurance . </s>
So Henry Bienen , you 're opponent is describing more what sounds like an American nightmare in terms of the debt , in terms of having to do this , in terms of being the wrong thing for lots of people . </s>
And yet they go into it unthinkingly and get hurt by it . Can you take that on ? Well , I did n't think this was a debate about cost . I 'd be quite happy to talk about cost . A lot of the sticker price is discounted , as you know , through very substantial financial aid . </s>
Plus I also took literally the topic of college which means lots of low-cost colleges Vivek and others and myself pointed out . I do n't think it 's a nightmare for people . </s>
I think most people come out of a college experience feeling better . In fact , there 's even surveys about how do you feel . You feel better as a person . And it 's quite positive . I think of it as a consumption good but not as a full-time party for four years . </s>
No doubt there are some people who do that . Woe to them . But it 's a consumption good in that there 's something good in and of itself of learning about beautiful things and learning more analytical ways of thinking . It was Steve Jobs himself , the late Steve Jobs , who said when he came back after dropping out of Reed and sat in on courses , he took a calligraphy course . And that calligraphy course gave him a whole new world of thinking about design . </s>
Who knows what , in the college experience will trigger for people thinking about the world in a different way . Let me go to Charles Murray and -- maybe we want to discuss what the metric is , how do we describe whether college is worth it . And your opponent is saying , you know , you can learn beautiful ideas . And I was an English major , and I speak English now superbly . </s>
It 's been very practical and useful for me . But -- but seriously , is there -- are we putting dollar and cents measurement on something that needs to be measured more broadly than that ? Well , I 'm not doing that when I say that too many kids are going to college . I 'm coming at it -- again , let 's go back to the American dream thing . </s>
In 1960 , which was n't that long ago for somebody as old as I am , only eight percent of American adults had college degrees . So college was a big deal then . But 92 percent did n't , including most of the successful people in this country . </s>
Not having a college degree had no relationship to the American dream at all at that time . College did have prestige . But you did n't look down on somebody who had n't gone to college . </s>
And one of the things we do n't like to say any more , but it is absolutely true , is we do now . If you are just a high school graduate , you are a second class citizen in this country . </s>
That is a kind of destruction of the American dream that I think it 's becoming like a caste system where if you go not just to college but to an elite college , the doors will open and you are going to be a success , and you do n't give into that -- But they 're arguing for more people to go to college to -- No , I 'm not . </s>
No , no . No , no . I 'm saying they 're arguing for more people to go to college , thus to presumably reduce the caste system . The caste system is real . </s>
I mean , how many people out in the audience can tell to a fare-thee-well when someone says what college they graduated from , you know very well , you go clicking through your mind , and you can place that college as to where it is in the stratification . The argument that your opponents have made that a Bachelor 's degree is meaningless , now you -- you meant that in the extreme . I 'm sure you 're -- you also said that it -- If that 's the only bit of information you have about a person , you do n't know a thing . </s>
Okay . What about -- I want to tell you , and mostly again because I am an immigrant , and I understand the American dream more -- better than most Americans do . Look at the rise of America relative to its education . </s>
We rose -- in the '50s and the '60s , we were coming out of the war . </s>
It was a different era . Over the last 50 or 60 years , we 've become the only world super power . Yes , the economy is in the tank right now . </s>
Yes , things are bad . We 'll come out of it . This country keeps reinventing itself because it has smart people who can think outside the box that -- who can reinvent themselves over and over again . Yes , there 're some outliers who ca n't . </s>
But the average American can reinvent him or herself , and that 's what makes this country what it is . Bachelor 's degrees , if we want to declare bachelor 's degree are irrelevant , then let 's invent something new . But we 're not going to be able to change the system like that . Like you said , if we outlaw bachelor 's degrees , we 're going to declare defeat to the rest of the world because the rest of the world has caught the American dream . Those Chinese students I talk about , they are just like my students here at Duke and at Berkeley . </s>
They 're just like the students we meet over here . They read the books . They follow us . They understand what we 're doing . </s>
They want to get those bachelor 's because they want to get master 's , and they want to get PhDs . </s>
That 's how it is . So forget about our vision of the American dream . We 're now a small part of the world . Our economy is becoming a decreasing part of the world . </s>
We 're going to be competing like you wo n't believe over the next 10 , 20 , 30 years . side respond to that . Peter Thiel . Let me just tackle this whole globalization international thing . So I think there obviously are a lot of things that are very admirable about India , China . </s>
People have a great work ethic . They 're thinking very much about the future . And I do not want to at all underestimate how serious the competition is or to encourage people to be complacent . But the proposition we 're debating today , do too many kids go -- are too many kids going to college , and if you look at those countries , the percentage is much smaller , and it is -- I looked these numbers up because I figured -- I thought you might make this argument . </s>
And the U.S. -- about 40 percent of college-aged students are in college . And of course there are a lot of them that end up dropping out . It starts at more than 40 . </s>
But on average , 40 percent are in college . </s>
In China , the number is 20 percent . In India , the number is 10 percent . And if you want to look at China and India , it is a brutally selective system . </s>
Very few people can get in . People are worked incredibly hard once they 're in college . And if we want to be more like them , the first thing -- simple approximation is you have far fewer people go to college . And this is true of any other country in the world you 'd look at . </s>
And so if the U.S. should take its bearings from other countries , that is a very powerful argument for our side . Let 's bring in Henry Bienen . Well , at one time , it was n't so long ago , the United States was first in the world in post- secondary enrollment . </s>
And whatever post-secondary enrollment meant . And now we 're -- we were 12th a few years ago . I think we 've actually fallen to 15 , to 16 . </s>
If anybody thinks that 's a good idea , they out to think again . I want to add one more perspective getting back to the Indians and the Chinese . </s>
Yes , it 's a smaller percent of the population . But look at the industry in which everyone is moving , technology , engineering . </s>
1.5 million versus about 100 , 150,000 of ours . They 're eating our lunch . India has become a $ 80 billion IT industry which came out of nothing at all the last 15 years . How ? By educating its people . </s>
Zero to $ 80 billion in 15 years . But they 're saying that the number of people being educated relative to the rest of the population is a tiny fraction . But there -- that 's because they do n't have the resources to do it . They 're putting everything they can into education . So if you were king of the world , would you educate everybody in India ? </s>
Would everybody go to college ? </s>
Absolutely . </s>
I would educate everyone in the world because it uplifts society . What it does is it improves -- because the low-level jobs are going to go away . </s>
Robotics are going to take over manufacturing in the next ten years or so . So those jobs which could be menial jobs that you could have non-educated people doing , they 're going to disappear . It 's become a knowledge economy where everyone has to now do intelligent things or they 're unemployed . Charles Murray . But look at the way the caste system persists because you have good jobs , which is being a lawyer or a doctor or a scientist , and then you have menial jobs . </s>
Now , tell me where it is written that we ought to -- , Charles , you 're creating a new caste system . </s>
But let me finish my sentence . Right . That we ought to think about what is more intrinsically rewarding about being a lawyer than being a cabinetmaker ? </s>
Why does that have -- should that have any privilege over being a cabinetmaker ? There are a whole lot of jobs in this world which are wonderfully fulfilling that do n't require a college degree and we talk about them as being vocational training . That is a kind of invidious caste system in education that I want to destroy by getting rid of college degrees . Charles , which jobs are you talking about because what the other side is arguing is that those jobs are disappearing due to automation and robots , et cetera . </s>
Wait a minute , skilled jobs , listen , you want to hire a lawyer or a doctor you can do that in a nanosecond . You want to find good skilled labor ? That 's hard . Finding a good plumber , a good electrician to come and fix things , that 's hard . </s>
We have a demand for a wide variety of skills -- -- a wide variety of skills that we are n't meeting because guess what that 's demeaning those occupations . Henry Bienen . But now , Charles wants to overturn the wage structure of the world , not just the U.S. , he wants to overturn the return to knowledge . </s>
I do n't have any bias against craft skills and I agree that sometimes they 're in very short supply and they get a good return , but we -- you know , if you believe at all in markets , I assume , Charles , coming from where he comes from and with his ideas believes in markets , people pay a return to something that they think is relatively scarce or that they value in some way . And sometimes it 's a great scientist and sometimes it 's a great artist and sometimes it 's a great craft person . But that 's the way it works , so you can have a lot of complaints about college and cost , but now he wants to complain about the world wage structure . But you ca n't -- </s>
Peter Thiel . No , no , no . Let 's let Peter Thiel -- But you ca n't have it both ways either . </s>
You want to say on the one hand that college is an end in itself , it 's an absolute good , we do n't ask any questions about it , it 's not instrumental , and on the other hand it is completely instrumental and it 's what leads you to getting a better job , more high paying job . You can not have it both ways . </s>
But the jobs -- One second , Vivek asked you a question about your point , but -- I said the jobs they 're talking about , the plumbers and electricians , they 're less than one percent of the U.S. population . What about the other 99 percent ? </s>
What do they do ? Charles Murray . You know , one of the great television shows on TV is `` Dirty Jobs . '' Any of you ever seen it ? Every week they go to a dirty job but the thing is you find out a couple of things , there are a huge number of ways to make your living . </s>
They are interesting , they are fulfilling , the people who are doing the , you 'd like to know -- One percent of the population -- -- it is a great curative for the kind of way we are talking about the job structure , which has nothing to do with wages , it has to do with making a living in a way that is fulfilling and satisfying . There 's nothing wrong with doing those jobs for people who want to do them . The issue is how do you pick a child who gets educated or who not gets educated , you basically want to do it based on IQ . </s>
Of course I do n't . How would you pick someone who goes to school ? </s>
I want absolutely open competition for every position in any kind of educational institution no matter what it 's teaching . </s>
Where you got the idea I want to put IQ scores on kids ' foreheads -- Look on the bell curve . -- say , `` You can go to college , and you can not , '' I 'd like you to read a passage of anywhere that I 've said that . Charles , Charles , one point that the other side did make is that education can be transformative and somebody who may not necessarily start out as a freshman seeming like a superstar signed up for a BA even of the nature that you may not find terribly useful , that the experience of going to college can cause a blossoming and that just by being there , being in the situation , somebody who was n't very promising might turn out to have a lot of promise , what -- can you take that on ? Well -- </s>
Okay , Peter Thiel , you were ready with it . Go ahead . Well , you know , we can find all sorts of anecdotal things . We were told by the other side that we should n't look at anecdotes like Zuckerberg or Gates or Jobs and I agree those are exceptional cases , and there obviously are all sorts of people who have idiosyncratic things that can happen in college . </s>
They can also happen outside of college . Socialization does not have to happen in college . People should learn how -- this is again a really bizarre recent phenomenon , you know , 92 percent of people did not go to college in 1960 , they were able to be citizens , they were able to vote , they were able to be -- we would n't say nobody should have voted in 1960 because they did n't have college degrees . That would have been an invidious thing to say . And when you say that college is a bubble , are you also arguing that colleges have a self interest in growing , that in other words , they’re signing up students to keep the tuition up ? </s>
Oh , I think there are extraordinary conflicts of interest . </s>
It’s like subprime mortgage brokers saying people should buy houses . I mean , the self dealing that is going on is incredibly severe in all of this . </s>
And I do think -- All right , I want to take that point directly -- all right go ahead . One other -- one last point . I don’t think you can separate the question entirely from the cost question . And so it’s like saying , you know , “Mrs . </s>
Lincoln , besides that , how’d you like the play ? ” </s>
So besides the fact that college costs you an arm and a leg , how much do you like it ? And these two things are linked together . Henry Bienen , having quintupled Northwestern’s endowment , the point made from the other side is that you had a conflict of interest , not you personally but people in your profession have conflict of interest in inducing students to continue coming to school because of the revenue that flows in as a result . Well , first of all , Northwestern , I can tell you , if you are a full tuition payer and you had no financial aid at all , you are paying about 60 , 65 percent of the total cost of the university , and it leaves out a lot of other things that universities do , which lead to higher costs , some of which I approve of and some of which I don’t . But we’re the research generators of the world in American universities today . </s>
Bell Labs is gone . The big pharmas have offshored their research . We’ve adopted those costs . Now , not every university is a research university . </s>
It’s not a Northwestern or a Duke or a Stanford , but I want to speak to the question of cost directly since our opponents , though I don’t think it’s the subject of the debate . But you know , we don’t have to induce anybody to come to Northwestern . </s>
We get 33,000 , 34,000 applicants for something like an entering class of 2,000 students . So -- and that is true of the elite universities . Not all universities look like that . That’s true . And there is this range of places , which we’ve tried to talk about . </s>
If you believe in demand at all , people are still voting with their feet . </s>
And by the way , it’s foreigners who are voting with their feet because they want to come to American universities for the Ph.D. level . </s>
We’ve talked about undergraduate education a lot . </s>
But there’s something else that universities do out there , or at least certain kinds of universities which are very , very important . It’s a very important function for the place that I -- </s>
And response for this side ? If not , I’ll move onto something else . Okay , I was curious to know , for you to paint a picture of , again , if you were kind of the world and these BA programs were shut down or , at the very least , people were discouraged from going to them , heard your message and stopped going , how many people would be left in college ? What percentage ? And where would they be going to school ? </s>
In my ideal world , the college campuses would be more full of students than ever , but they wouldn’t be there for four years . Somebody wants to go into business , so they have some marketing courses they want to take and some business administration and accounting courses . </s>
Takes them a year and a half . </s>
And they finish all the courses they want to take , and then there is a good certification exam , like the CPA exam for accountants . They take that exam , which doesn’t have to consist of just filling in dots and circles . It can be work samples . </s>
It can be a variety of things , but you can take that to the employer and say , “Here’s what I know academically about business.” Do you two sides have common ground on this issue , that -- because it sounds to me that when you’re defining this motion as being about a variety of forms of school and education -- College -- community college is college . </s>
And Charles is also talking about a variety of forms of education , it sounds to me as though there’s common ground on this or you’re just coming at it from different -- Some common ground . I’m not so willing to consign the B.A . four-year to the dustbin of history , as Charles is . But I don’t think everything will or should stay the same . I don’t disagree with that . </s>
I don’t believe -- for example , take distance learning . I suspect we’re probably on the same page . I think you’re going to see more distance learning , even at the major four-year universities . It’s going to happen . People can take a statistics course online . </s>
I’m chairman of the board of a company called Ithaca Harbors where we’re doing research on how people learn online . </s>
Maybe they learn statistics online as well as being in a classroom . Maybe they can even do Econ 101 like that . I don’t know . We’ll see . </s>
I’m for experimenting . Our law school went from everybody in a three-year law school program to some people in a two-year program . I think the great universities will change . </s>
They should change . Not everybody has to be in a bricks-and- mortar place . Online , for-profits , can be solely online or 70 percent online courses . So we ought to think about this in a flexible way . I don’t disagree with Charles and Peter on that . </s>
I think we can close down the discussion . </s>
Charles Murray . All I’m asking is we don’t put kids in the straightjacket of the BA and we enable them to get certifications that show what they know even if it 's -- even if they 'd done it all online and that the B.A . loses its mystique . But your -- your partner . Your partner , Peter , spices the argument with -- by coming at it from a completely different direction which is talking about the experience of college actually being a waste of great talent as opposed to a resting place for the mediocre . </s>
I think what Charles and I agree on very much is that there is no one size fits all approach . There are certain skilled people , very talented people . Not every talented person should go to Harvard . You know , there are a lot of different kinds of things different people should do . </s>
And I think that 's sort of a basic starting point . We do n't believe there is a single straight jacket . And the crazy thing in our society is that the more talented you are , the narrower the straight jacket has become . </s>
This is a very , very bizarre feature of it . We also agree that learning is generally a very good thing . And we agree that we should be -- I think we all four of us agree on that . </s>
But there 's a bit of a disagreement that I do n't want to understate , is that a great deal of what masquerades as learning is nothing more than credentialing . And the basic numbers I 've seen is that it 's something like 90 percent credentialing , 10 percent learning if you try to sort of break the numbers out . </s>
If you got into Harvard versus finishing high school , let 's say you make 30,000 a year out of high school , 60,000 a year out of Harvard . Let 's say it 's two to one , something in that ballpark . You get to 45,000 , if you were good enough to get into Harvard , that 's the selection . And you get to 57,000 if people knew you got into Harvard , that 's the signaling . So 90 percent is credentialing . </s>
And the learning gets you from 57 to 60 . We 're in favor of that 10 percent . But it is outrageous how it 's been conflated with this credential which is being parasitically charged to people in this way -- costs have escalated and escalated and escalated . All right . </s>
Peter Thiel , thank you very much . We 're going to take a break . </s>
And when we come back , we 're going to go to questions from you in the audience . So I 'm going to do my little bit of radio here . This is one of those moments when I need you to very spontaneously applaud when I -- exactly when I tell you to . </s>
And I 'm going to -- I 'm going to say a line or so , and then I 'm going to -- then I 'm going to say the line again without the applause to give the radio editors a chance to make an editing decision on how to do that . So when I raise my right hand , you can just do a round of applause like before , please . Our motion is too many kids go to college . </s>
This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. We are in Chicago . We have two teams of two arguing out this motion , and now we 're going to go to questions from the audience . </s>
And I 'm going to do that one more time without the applause . Our motion is too many kids go to college . This is a debate from Intelligence Squared U.S. We are in Chicago . And now we 're going to go to questions from the audience . So if you can raise your hand , a mic will come to you , and I want to encourage you to -- to -- right down in the front will be first -- to really think in terms of a question that moves us along on this motion and that is terse . </s>
No two-parters . And have some phrases so it really is a question . Thanks . Ma'am , can you tell us your name , please ? </s>
Oh , and if you hold -- it 's already turned on . Hello ? Can you hear me ? </s>
And if you hold the mic about a fist 's distance from your mouth , the radio broadcast will hear it fine . Hi . Katherine Ibata-Arens , professor of international political economy and expert on Asian entrepreneurship from DePaul university . I enjoyed this talk quite a lot . I 'm an alum of Northwestern , so it 's a great pleasure to see Dr. Bienen who was the president while I was a doctoral candidate there . </s>
It 's a great pleasure to be with all of you tonight . </s>
My question is something that has not come up in the debate , and that is social networks . </s>
I do analysis of high-tech gazelles all over the world , and I find that the social networks that individual entrepreneurs obtain while they are in the K through 16 pipeline , particularly while they 're at universities and/or graduate schools are absolutely critical for them getting , one , trusting business partners , their first business partners , and two , angel investments . So I 'd like for both sides to comment on the quality of the social networks that you get while you 're in university . Peter Thiel . Well , I think -- I think the social networks are quite valuable . It 's still not clear that it justifies charging a quarter million . </s>
I think the social networks tend to be the most valuable only at the elite colleges . Once you go below that level , they actually function in a way where people , again , do not have access . So I think you have a very ambiguous aspect about how it works . In practice , in Silicon Valley , most of the companies do get started by people who are a few years out of college . And I tend to think that when I started PayPal , there were some people I brought in from Stanford , but I started with a colleague who -- we met in a different social context in Silicon Valley . </s>
And we 'd gone to different schools , so it ended up being somewhat -- my own experience was different . </s>
But I do think elite colleges have a social networking value . That 's a very oddly different thing from what we 've heard here . </s>
That 's very different from that it’s about learning , that it 's about turning people into citizens or anything like that . </s>
And it seems to me that even if that 's true , it should cost way , way less . </s>
Vivek ? You know , not just elite colleges . Peter keeps talking about a quarter million dollars . That 's Stanford . </s>
The rest of America is not Stanford . Most colleges are much , much cheaper . And the direction the students have are the same . It 's not that the elite , you know , students at Stanford have a big advantage over the others . </s>
It 's just that they happen to have gone to a nicer campus . </s>
So the social network is equally important no matter where you go . Now , the other thing is that if you do n't go to college , if you drop -- forget about dropping out . If you went directly from high school to work , you 're going to have a very junior position in some big company or some startup where you have very limited interaction with anyone else . You 're not going to build social skills . </s>
You 're not going to have a network greater than the handful of people that you happen to work with in your department . I do n't know how many of you worked in big companies or any companies . But it 's always to people you 're exposed to . When you 're in college , you 're interacting with lots and lots of people all across the board . It 's those interactions that define you . </s>
That ca n't be quantified . But that 's what carries you through your whole life . You get to meet diverse people . </s>
It 's not just people who happen to work in the same field and the same company that you do . So the kids that are dropping out and starting their own startups , they 're going to be disadvantaged for the rest of their lives . </s>
I do n't know what they 're going to be 30 years from now because they have n't had that social interaction which defines human beings . </s>
We need that . </s>
We need that extra three or four years where you get to stabilize and learn and become who you are and decide what you want to be when you grow up . Peter -- You do n't know that going into college . Peter , did you say earlier that if you were to do it all over again , you would still go to Stanford . And can you take 20 seconds to explain why , and why you do n't feel that the time you spent getting your -- on a graduate degree was a drag on your -- on your other -- other energies . </s>
Well , I did n't know what else to do . And I think I probably would not have known what else to do . In some ways , I was probably a candidate for a good general liberal arts humanities education in many ways . I was really interested in learning . </s>
I was very interested in these things on their terms . I do n't think most people are like me . I think a lot of people are at a different -- at a different place . </s>
Peter , they are like you . They are like you . They do n't know what they want to be . It 's -- I do n't think people are identical . I think this is -- </s>
They 're not as smart as you , but they are like you . I tell you . I know that this is a big philosophical disagreement we have . </s>
We should not understate . I do n't think everybody is cut from the same cloth . People are actually different . And we need to acknowledge the diversity that exists in our world and we should n't pretend that everybody is the same and everybody should do the same thing . </s>
Peter , you did n't know what you wanted to be when you were young . Most children do n't know . </s>
They 're muddling through it . They learn by interacting with other people and getting ideas from other students who have diverse backgrounds . That 's how they decide what they 're going to be . But -- but , I think -- I think that most -- I think that there are a lot of people already in high school who were not academically motivated . </s>
And I can say that even if they do not know what they wanted to do professionally or work wise , you could say they were n't particularly interested in reading books and learning . </s>
And this was not their talent . That 's not what they were psyched to do . And there is something crazy about saying everyone has to be locked into a room and read books and -- and that 's what we have to do . You made that point very forcefully , I just want to go to another question . Sir . </s>
You 've got a black book in your left hand . If you raise it , a microphone will find you . There you go . Hi . </s>
My name is Jeff Nelson , and I actually run a college readiness and persistence program here in Chicago that takes low-income kids to and through colleges . And amazingly , though , I 've actually been appreciating some of the comments that are coming out of this table . I do -- By this table , you mean the side that 's arguing that too many kids go to college . Correct . </s>
Okay . What I did agree with is that I share a frustration with higher ed , and I think there is a distortion . </s>
But I think the solution is unfounded . I do n't think the solution is actually that you should deter kids from actually going to college . I think your frustration comes from the fact that there are fundamental reforms that need to be made to higher education . </s>
In my opinion , it should in some way mirror the reforms that are happening in charter schools . Could you bring this around to a question ? I will get to a question . </s>
Thanks . So -- But I mean now . Thanks . So -- so the question is , do you think there are fundamental reforms that could be made to higher education that would sway you to want to have more kids actually stay in college ? </s>
Do you mean the four-year classic -- Yes . Yes . Yeah , I think that certifications as a replacement for the B.A . is the way to go . And I think there are a lot of market forces working in that direction because the B.A . really is meaningless . </s>
And employers do know that it tells them extremely little . Whereas if they could get some strong indication that the kid sitting in front of them has actually learned something about things that are relevant to the job they 're going to have , that would be good for them . And it would level the playing field . Let me repeat , I do not see our college campuses having fewer people on them , I see it having as many or more but not locked into the B.A . straightjacket . We 're being streamed live on Slate.com . </s>
Slate.com is our media partner and we had people submit questions actually beforehand once they knew what the topic was , and I just want to read one of those questions here . From Minneapolis , Minnesota , a Rob Barbeau asks if fewer people go to college , actually he said if less people go to college , but I 'm an English major so -- -- sorry , sorry , Rob Barbeau , but he said if fewer people go to college , should n't the value of a college degree go up ? Charles Murray . I 'm sorry . If fewer people go to college , should n't the value of a college degree go up ? </s>
No . It 's because the college degree , you may have heard me say this , does n't mean anything . If you say , `` Oh , well , if you have a classical education and that becomes the standard of what goes into a B.A . and you can be confident that 's what a kid has gotten when they have a B.A. , then you 'd have a very different kind of value associated with a B.A. , but it does n't happen right now . Okay . </s>
Henry Bienen . If we have fewer people who go to college , the premium of wages will go up in China and India and Brazil and Turkey where the jobs will go , and those folks will benefit . You know , I 'm reminded of the onion which had a suggested solution for the recession in the U.S. was just to give everybody another degree . And I think we have to think we ca n't just mechanically say , `` You go to college , you get a B.A . '' It is , `` What are you learning ? </s>
What are the specifics ? '' You have to be focused much more on the detail -- No , I wanted to take to you , Henry Bienen , the question that -- Peter 's opening point is that , that is the default position in society , increasing more so , certainly more than 45 years ago , that it is -- if you 're anywhere close to middleclass or aspiring to the middleclass it is an automatic , `` I have to go to college , '' without a whole much great deal of the sort of weighing of other options that this team is talking about . </s>
Can you take that on ? Is it too much of the default 's position ? Well , I think one of the problems in the U.S. , and I said this earlier , is that we have n't had a lot of other good options . </s>
So I 'm not against having vocational streams in high schools , for example Westinghouse High School here , a relatively new high school , is an interesting place . It has both a high performance stream and a vocational stream . See , Mr. Mayor , you send me to these places , I try to learn something about them . So that 's okay with me . </s>
I 'm not against that . I 'm not against for more on the job training . Only 10 percent of our labor force has what the Swiss and the Germans would call on the job training . </s>
I 'm not against that . Americans have decided they did n't want to go in that direction , they did n't want to stream the kids in high school really early . But I think it 's not a terrible option at least to open it up . </s>
There 's a question down in the front room . You have a mic ? Yes . Okay . Hi , I 'm Jessica Posener . </s>
My question is that it seems to me that in the -- with the invention of the Internet , technology , globalization , there seems to be less and less a concrete set of skills that people need to be successful in the world . There 's much more like what a liberal arts education I think maybe focuses on developing critical thinking skills . And so how would a shift from a liberal arts or sort of a more a broader education to more concrete courses , focus on a very specific skill set , change the ability of our society to innovate and to continue to respond to changing demands ? So -- Peter Thiel . </s>
-- I actually very much disagree with almost every premise posted in that question but just let me -- -- let me just -- Wow . -- I 'll just flag one . The most concrete skill oriented education people get is engineering degrees , and that is actually probably the one area and we may even agree on this where I think the U.S. does not have an excess of engineers . </s>
But that is something that 's specific and tracked and engineering is specific and that 's what people get paid for the most . And as we were heading into a more technologically oriented world , that 's actually -- there 's going to probably be an increasing premium on engineering and on specific types of skills . </s>
And if I had to give people advice and they were set on going to college , you should study engineering or some form of engineering unless you are in a really unusual situation and really passionate about something else . So I would sort of quibble with the question on that level . Yes , because I 've been wanting to make this point because I think it was Charles who -- if I were to reinterpret what he said , he wasn’t against too many kids going to college . He was really against too many kids going to get four-year B.A . at expensive colleges . </s>
I don’t think that’s really a mis-description , but so much of this conversation from Peter and Charles has been a focus where they’re negative about the general B.A . or presumably the humanities and social sciences . So let me speak up for the humanities and social sciences . So there are lots of smart people who think analytically and rigorously who take the humanities and social sciences , who are art history majors , God love them , and who are historians and who learn Arabic and who learn Chinese , or who learn Hindi or who learn whatever . </s>
And we’re going to send lots of those people . They need to have those languages . </s>
They need to learn cultures that are different from the U.S. They’re going to be business people who go abroad . </s>
They’re going to be diplomats , whoever they may be , so why should we only think that the only place to get an education which is rigorous , analytical , and will serve you well is going to be in the engineering , mathematics -- So what’s really going on in the Center for Nanofabrication and Molecular Self Assembly ? Those are not English majors hanging out there . </s>
No , nothing I said is against the sciences . I sunk a fortune into the sciences , and we hired the best chemists and computer scientists we could hire , and that’s great . I don’t think it’s one hand here or the other hand that . </s>
You can do lots of things in a great university . Charles Murray . I just want to comment that when we talk about the humanities and social sciences and rigorous critical thinking , I’m not only in favor that , I think we have a dearth of it in the university system . The problem is we are talking as if universities consisted of Stanford , of Northwestern and Harvard and places like that . Very few kids go to those colleges . </s>
Most of them are at West Podunk State or its equivalent . And you are talking about course that they’re no relation -- Could you name some names , seriously , of the types of colleges that you’re referring to ? Yeah , you take the state university systems which usually have about three tiers . There’s the , like Ohio State and Iowa University and so forth . </s>
Then there’s a second tier of colleges which are acknowledged to be not nearly as good even though they’re four- year and sometimes there’s a third tier . And those are the places where you are getting the courses that teach economics with magazine articles , that teach Shakespeare by having kids watch movies of Shakespeare’s plays but you don’t ask them to read them , places where kids do not -- I’m not talking anecdotes . I’m talking surveys about the percentages of kids who graduate from college unable to write grammatical sentences . </s>
Critical thinking doesn’t enter the realm of college life in those places . Question right in the center with the beret . </s>
Thanks . Hi . </s>
My name is Irene and I’m a final-year physics college student . And my question is , as a society , we’ve grown up with the notion of the importance of a well-rounded individual which is why a number of four-year Bachelor programs in the U.S. have a substantial amount of unrelated course work that has nothing to do with a person’s major . On the other hand , Europe , which recently adopted the three-year Bachelor system a couple of years ago , has much less of that unrelated , more well- rounded amount of coursework and more focus on the concrete , actual coursework that pertains to one’s major . </s>
And my question to you is which system do you think has an advantage in the future ? Well , may I respond first by saying that if the required course in the humanities was to take The Epic Poem from Homer to Milton , I’d say that’s great . If it’s to take The Epic Film from Ben Hur to Lord of the Rings , it’s not so great . So what we have as course requirements in this country , it just doesn’t fit this image you want to see of people sitting Aristotle and the classics and the rest of it . It’s not the curriculum . </s>
Sir , there -- you’re behind -- yeah , thank you . And the mic’s coming from your right side . My name’s Randall Spencer . Could you -- we didn’t turn the mic on . </s>
Could you just repeat now ? I think it’s ready for you . </s>
My name’s Randall Spencer . I myself graduated from a four-year college with an engineering degree . We’ve heard about students that -- how much more people make by getting college degrees . </s>
But what do we know about those who think that they have this idea that college is something that they’re supposed to do , and they end up going to college and building up debt and they don’t finish . What do we know about them as far as the money they make , the debt they accrue , the percentage of people that are going to college and are not directly -- Can I rephrase your question to put a twist on it to relate it to our topic , is are so many kids -- are there people going to college who are hurt by going to college ? Right , exactly . </s>
And are there more or less -- Henry -- okay , great question . Henry Bienen . It 's interesting . The data shows , and the data is conclusive on this , that it 's not just getting a degree which increases your life chances and your income . </s>
In fact , even in community colleges , which are basically two-year places , if you 're in there for a period of time like one semester , you have a better chance , and you 'll earn more money than if you never went . And this is true of two-year , four-year colleges , whatever . </s>
So it 's -- if you look at this , it 's almost linear that the more time you spend in college , irrespective of whether you get a degree , pays off for you . Now , there is a sheepskin effect at around 16 years . But it 's a little bump . </s>
It 's not a huge bump so -- How do you know that going to college is what causes that benefit as opposed to people who are able to achieve those sorts of things in life rather than people who select to go to college ? </s>
Well , there 's always a causation issue , as I said from the beginning . It 's not so clear often what 's correlation and what 's cause . On this one , I think we have lots of studies which show that when you try to normalize or hold account for all the other variables , and there are lots of them ; family background , environment , even intelligence . </s>
I mean , some people are smarter than other people . That 's a fact of life . Whatever you do , you still find a college effect . </s>
But the point I was making to this question , John , because I think it 's a very important question , that -- and even if you look at debt , if you look at the number of years in college or the number of even months in college , it 's extraordinary . </s>
It pays off . Peter Thiel . Well , you know , I think there is -- I think it pays off but not nearly as much as you think because I still think it 's mostly correlation and just a tiny bit causation . </s>
But I want to quibble a little bit more with the idea of the data shows and what this means . And we 're always looking backwards . And so 2005 , you could have said the data shows that housing prices always go up . And they are less likely to go up if they 've gone up a lot . And so what I will tell you as an analytic truth , not an empirical truth , when people are paying way more than they ever have , there are going to be more people who have been hurt than who were hurt in the '50s or '60s , when it was effectively free . </s>
And so -- and this will not be seen in advance . You will see this in 10 , 15 , 20 years time . You 're starting to see it with college students , have to move back in with their parents because they can not afford to get their own place and pay off their debts . So is that the popping of the bubble that you referred to , tas college being ? When you described it as a bubble in housing , and housing crashed obviously when credit dried up . </s>
What is the popping of the college bubble ? What I think we are seeing is a gradual unravel with the -- with this incredible recession in the U.S. because the basic lie that you take on all this debt , and then you get a good job is being seen as not quite true . And there are many cases where it 's not true . </s>
And I basically think it 's sort of -- we see it unravel over four or five years as you have one class after another graduate , and there are no good jobs , even for the people with college degrees . </s>
I would say it 's different from housing because there 's no specific market . You ca n't precisely evaluate a college degree . And that 's actually one of the things that makes it a much more pernicious bubble than housing because it will not pop instantly , and therefore it 's likely to be actually even more pronounced and more extreme before it unravels . Another question from the rear there . Hi . </s>
I 'm exploration and a graduate of the University of Chicago . We 've heard lots of reasons to go to college . Most of it has been about work and economics , a little bit about the need to meet diverse people , be exposed to things we might not see before . In the spirit of the debate , could you clarify what it is you think college is actually for ? What 's the end or purpose of college ? </s>
What a great question . </s>
Thank you . Henry Bienen or Vivek , if you want to take that . Different strokes for different folks . I think it 's what you make of it . </s>
I think it can be sometimes very focused . </s>
It can be , as Vivek has said , people do n't know what they want to do until they get there . You learn , how do I know what I want to be until I grow up . I do n't have a handy dandy formula . I think it 's a good question , but I do n't think there 's an answer to it that it should be this or that because people are so diverse . They come with different interests , different experiences , different backgrounds . </s>
And they grow presumably in those -- in those years in college . </s>
And many of them find themselves . They get sparked by different things . I do n't know what 's going to spark somebody 's interest . I mentioned for Steve Jobs it was a calligraphy course he stepped into . For somebody , it may be reading Shakespeare . </s>
It may be looking at beautiful paintings . It may be listening to beautiful music . </s>
It may be all of a sudden math grabs them , and they did n't know what they could do . </s>
But would it ever be watching Lord of the Rings . Could be . </s>
One more question on the far right , ma'am . Yep , if you could just stand up . Hello . </s>
My name is Layla Dolsin , and I 'm currently an MBA student at the University of Chicago . We 've heard that -- or some of you have compared college education to a bubble . </s>
And I 'm sitting here wondering whether it might not be a bubble but rather inflation . The same kind of healthy inflation that you would experience with inflation of GDP as the economy grows . So what I 'm wondering is , do you feel like high school education , in the same way that it might have been sufficient for society in the '60s , is also sufficient for society today . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Charles Murray . Well , since I said that virtually everybody needs more education and training after high school , obviously , I think that high school is not sufficient . I do think that a great deal of what we talk about as a liberal education can be done at the K-12 level . </s>
There are things like the core knowledge curriculum that 's created by E.D . Hirsch , which is just wonderful . </s>
And it does n't teach everybody a full-fledged classical education , but it -- it gets a lot of the common cultural knowledge for everyone in K-12 . We are n't doing it in college . I think we could do it there . </s>
Let me take one more question . </s>
Green , wearing all green . </s>
Hello . My name -- hello , my name is Katherine Darts , and I 'm an architect and academic here , who was educated in Chicago , Paris and Copenhagen also . My question to everyone on the panel , what do academic institutions need to do to eliminate the influence-based system of family 's previous alumni relations and money that keep us from having this open competition of education that Mr. Murray wants and get us to the opportunity of -- I 'm going to respectfully pass on the question , although I think it 's a very valid point , because I do n't think it 's going to get us to the issue of whether too many kids go to college or not . </s>
Sir , in the black tie . But thank you for the question . Hi . My name is Phil Pappus . </s>
When I was young , I read that majority of the CEOs in Fortune 500 companies only had a high school education . Due to the deterioration of secondary education in the United States , is n't college , a college degree , a necessity to show that you have something that was once called a high school degree ? Peter Thiel . </s>
It 's possible that that 's -- well , I think high school is very -- lots of them are still very good . A lot of them are not . But it seems to me that that 's a perverse cure for the disease . </s>
And so if that is the disease , we should be fixing K through 12 education . And I think probably all of us on the panel would agree that K through 12 education has a lot of room for improvement . All right . And I have to say that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . And here is where we are . </s>
We are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater . The statements will be two minutes each . They will be uninterrupted . And remember , you voted before the debate , and this is their last chance for them to try to convince you that they have argued most persuasively . </s>
And you 'll be asked to vote once again and choose a winner just a few minutes from now . So onto round three , closing statements from each debater in turn . </s>
Our motion is this : `` Too many kids go to college . '' </s>
And here to speak against the motion , Henry Bienen , president emeritus of Northwestern University . Well , no one seems to doubt , including our opponents , that there is a wage premium and a benefit to college . They may have some confusion about what kind of college , whether they 're expensive or not , though the debate was not about cost , as I understood it . Mr. Thiel raises , I think , interesting points about causation , the direction of causation . But I think it 's clear also that going to college is n't of itself an effect . </s>
It 's a variable which moves people along in their lives , gives them more chance and gives them more income , independent of all the other things that get them to college in the first place . Now , yes , there are too many people who are unprepared that go to college . And I agree with what Peter said at the very last minute , that it would be a perverse effect to say , okay , college is going to be remedial for the lousy high school education that they got . The answer to that , which we 're trying very hard to do in Chicago , is to improve the K through 12 elementary and high school education . And that 's key . </s>
That is key to society as it is to make sure that higher education is good and affordable for all . </s>
So the answer is not that too many kids go to college any more than it would be too many kid go to high school or elementary school because they do n't get a good education in too many of those places , and I 'm sure there are plenty of colleges where they do n't get a good education , sure , I 'm sure that 's the case . I 've just never been in any of them but I know that they exist . So I think the answer is very clear and that you have to decide in the negative on the proposition that too many kids go to college . That is after all the proposition , it 's not about costs , it 's not about whether everything is perfect , at every college in the country , it 's not about whether we should do everything exactly how we 've done it , it is the proposition that too many kids go to college , and the answer is clearly and unequivocally that 's a wrong answer . Thank you , Henry Bienen . </s>
There 's a little bit of a lag on that one , but our motion is `` Too many kids go to college , '' and here to summarize his position in support of the motion , Peter Thiel . He is PayPal cofounder who 's 20 Under 20 Fellowship Awards grant cash to young tech entrepreneurs . The one thing that was clearly not done by the other side was to answer my question about where would the accountability be for all the people who get hurt by the system that costs too much and is not delivering . </s>
And it is clear to me that there is no accountability on the part of our education establishment . They 're not willing to give people refunds . They 're not -- if you get a Ford and it blows up , a Ford Pinto blows up , you can go to the Ford company , you can get money back for your car , you might even be able to sue them for torts , such a mentality is unthinkable in the college case . And given that there is this lack of accountability , buyer beware . You are on your own . </s>
You take on the loans . It 's worse than housing debt . You can never get out of it , not even through bankruptcy . Bush amended the bankruptcy laws in 2005 so you can not get out of college debts for the rest of your life . And you need to think about this on your own . </s>
The way bubbles end is when people start thinking for themselves . And that is the first thing we want to encourage people to do is not to simply go with the social pressure , not to go with the bill of goods , `` This has always been done . </s>
This is automatic . </s>
This is necessary . This is globalization . '' But think for yourself , `` Is the cost worth the benefit ? '' </s>
And when more people think for themselves about this , we will get to a very different equilibrium where there 's less of a caste system , less of a social need to do these things for status reasons , people will still go to college , they will still get advance degrees , but there will be fewer of them who do it because there are a lot of people who are doing it for the wrong reasons , and I think that will be a much healthier and more balanced country . Thank you , Peter Thiel . Our motion is `` Too many kids go to college . '' And here now to summarize his position against the motion , Vivek Wadhwa . He is director of research at Duke Center for Entrepreneurship and Research Commercialization . </s>
Yeah . </s>
What I heard from the other side was that if we define college the way Middle America does , then we actually are agreeing that we want more kids to go to college , so I 'm not going to spend my two minutes on that . </s>
I want to actually challenge my new friend , Peter Thiel , on something which is very dear to his heart , about the fact that it 's so expensive to go to college . That I agree with him on . And it 's also antiquated . The system 's antiquated . </s>
Peter and I are both associated with a great university called Singular University , which is on campus , where we teach about exponential technologies , how all these advances are happening which can change the world , impact the lives of billions . Well , you know , think about it , five or 10 years ago did you ever use an iPhone or an Android ? None of us did . </s>
I 'll bet you everyone in the audience has one today . The fact is that it 's now possible to communicate in ways we could never do before . We have these tabular devices which can deliver 3D simulations , take us into 3D worlds . We can teach people by taking them into games . </s>
We can change the entire concept of education . He has the ability to do that . He has done it before with social network , with Facebook , he 's done it with PayPal . He has the ability to do this . </s>
Instead of investing in silly little social media technologies , why do n't we put our joint efforts into improving education if it 's changing the way we deliver , to change the way we educate -- -- and changing the world . I tell you , Peter , you can make it happen . </s>
So I challenge you here publicly to put your energy into improving education , into automating , into rethinking the way we educate so that the masses can get educated because all of us agree that we do want more people to go to whatever we call college . Again , I 'm not going to define it as a four-year degree , again to get more education so we can be more competitive , we can take on the world , we can change the world together . We 're going to need it more than ever over the next few decades . </s>
Thank you , Vivek Wadhwa . Our motion is `` Too many kids go to college . '' And now to speak in support of the motion , Charles Murray . He is author of `` Real Education : Four Simple Truths for Bringing America 's Schools Back to Reality . '' I think that even though we 're supposed to be diametrically opposed , in fact there’s a lot of common ground . </s>
It’s not a very good thing to say in a debate . But suppose we got rid of the B.A . because it doesn’t mean anything . Suppose we had as the goal of education not this piece of paper , but we had as a goal of education that all children shall reach adulthood having discovered things they love to do and having learned how to do them well . </s>
If we take that as the goal of education , we will have a system utterly different from the one we have now , and it will not be college as we know it . It will not be four years , and a lot of times , it won’t be residential . And most of all , it will not separate people into those who are college graduates and those who are not . </s>
And the fact is that every career goes through a couple of phases . We all start out as apprentices . And after we learn our trade , we become journeyman . And some of us who get really good at it become master craftsmen . That is just as true of a history professor or a lawyer or a physician as it is of a carpenter or a plumber or an electrician . </s>
The kinds of changes we need to make to our educational system , sweeping , fundamental reforms , getting rid of the B.A. , moving to certifications , has as its ultimate goal , in my view , something that is very important for America as it is increasingly stratified by class . And that is that it promotes a recognition among us that we are all engaged in the same process . We are not divided into professionals and service workers or blue collar workers . We all start out as apprentices . We become journeyman , and we all strive to become master craftsmen . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Charles Murray . And that concludes our closing statements . We have been though all three rounds of this debate now , and it is time to learn which side you feel has argued best . We’re asking you again to go to the keypad at your seat that will register your vote . </s>
We’re asking you to judge on this motion , `` Too many kids go to college.” Which side presented the stronger arguments ? Press number one if you feel this side , arguing too many kids go to college , presented a better argument . </s>
Press number two if it was this side . Press number three if you are or became undecided in the course of the debate . </s>
And we’ll have the results in about 90 seconds from now . So before I announce the results of that debate , I just want to first of all thank our panelists for coming here with the attitude and the kind of argument that we encourage . They were terrific . </s>
And I want to say something about the questions that were asked here tonight . I really wish that I could import you folks back to New York . Because we had a lot of trouble with the question situation there , and you all really got the message . </s>
And there wasn’t a bad one among them . </s>
And so thank you very much , and thanks to the audience for all of that . So this is our first debate in the city of Chicago , and it was our second outside of New York . </s>
And we want to thank very , very much the organizers of Chicago Ideas Week for inviting us to be a partner program with them . And we also want to spend a very , very huge thanks to Grosvenor Capital Management who underwrote tonight’s debate for us and made the whole thing possible . </s>
Thank you . </s>
So we are -- we head back to New York . We have two more debates in the fall season . You can actually watch those online , as this one , it’s been streamed by our media partner , Slate . </s>
It will be 5:45 p.m. in Chicago on our debate days . And this is what we’re doing . </s>
On October 25 , we’re debating the motion , “Congress should approve Obama’s jobs plan.” The panelists at this point include the chief economist at Moody’s Analytics and also a former economic advisor to President Obama . On November 15 , our motion is `` The world would be better off without religion.” </s>
And our panelists then include a rabbi and Charles Darwin’s great-great grandson . Streaming at 5:45 on Slate.com . You can find a full listing of the panelists for these debates in tonight’s program , which you should have all been handed on the way in . And if you happen to be in New York for any of these , tickets are still available for some of them , for both of them . </s>
And for updates on future debates , you can go to our website . You drop a business card in one of the boxes on your way out , and we will follow up with emails on how you can get in touch with our website . </s>
We’re on Twitter , Intelligence Squared U.S. and you can become a fan on Facebook and get a discount to future debates by doing that . All of our debates can be heard on NPR stations across the country , including WBEZ here in Chicago . So if you tune in , you’ll hear your own applause , which makes it all worthwhile . </s>
All right now , these debaters have been arguing the motion `` Too many kids go to college.” We’ve asked you to listen to these debates as they went through three rounds . You voted before the debate and once again afterwards to tell us where you stood when you came in and which side you feel argued best . </s>
So here are the results . </s>
The motion , `` Too many kids go to college . '' Before the debate , 39 percent supported the motion , 40 percent were against , and 21 percent undecided . </s>
After the debate , 47 percent are for the motion for the side for the motion . That 's up eight percent . Against is 46 percent . That 's up six percent . </s>
Undecided seven percent . The side arguing for the motion , just barely wins this debate . </s>
Our congratulations to them . And thank you from me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S. We 'll see you next time . I’d like to welcome our panelists to the stage . Round of applause . I’ll introduce them in a moment but first I want to introduce the man who has made Intelligence Squared U.S. possible : Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
The Rosenkranz Foundation ; he started this four years ago in New York with the purpose of raising the public discourse in New York City . We are a force to be reckoned with there . This is our first foray outside and we are so pleased to be in the nation’s capital and so pleased to see so many of you . </s>
So I would like to first of all , to welcome Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
My role in these proceedings is to frame the debate , to outline why we think the topic is important and why we feel they’re intellectually respectable arguments on both sides . So , in late 2009 , computer operators in China gained access to Google’s computer network and obtained information about Chinese dissidents and about some of Google’s intellectual crown jewels including their development plans and they’re passwords and stuff . </s>
Chinese military strategy emphasizes cyber espionage to obtain our military and technological know-how . In the event of major conflict , they strive for the capacity to attack our home front , not by conventional arms but by disabling the vulnerable civilian computer systems that are essential to run our power systems , our telecommunications grids and our financial system . And China by and large , has a huge interest in our success . In contrast , terrorist groups have powerful motives to destroy our domestic infrastructure , particularly if they can do so without a physical presence in the United States , why wouldn’t they . </s>
So the extraordinary complexity of our computer systems with their hundreds of millions of lines of code , make them very hard to defend . The attacker needs to find only one weakness and the defender needs to find them all . And then advance . </s>
That 's why so many of our military 's best strategic thinkers consider cyber attacks our single biggest threat . So what 's the argument in favor of tonight 's motion ? </s>
Simply put , describing a worst-case does not make that case likely . It may seem a sensible precaution to defend against a dire outcome , but first one needs to assess both risks and costs . Apropos risks : How plausible is it that the Chinese or any other nation would attack our civilian computer infrastructure , even if they had the capacity to do so ? </s>
By targeting civilians , might their military commanders risk committing war crimes ? Would n't their strategists assume that we have the capacity to respond in kind ? </s>
And how plausible is it that terrorists who can barely talk to each other on cell phones are capable of a serious cyber attack ? </s>
And apropos costs : Consider the potential for the dead hand of government bureaucracy to stifle an invasion or to infringe our privacy . Do we really want to give the folks responsible for airport security greater powers of surveillance ? Is cyber war a threat that we 're not taking seriously enough ? Or is it one we have exaggerated ? It 's a very important question for our nation , and we 've assembled an extraordinary panel of experts to help you decide . </s>
Before we begin , though , I want to say a word of thanks to WAMU in D.C. that 's promoted this debate very , very heavily and is maybe responsible for a lot of you who are here tonight . And -- but particularly , I 'd like to introduce Jeff Ganek , the CEO of Neustar , which made this evening possible . And I hope you 'll join me in applauding Neustar 's generosity . </s>
Thanks , Robert , and thanks to Intelligence Squared for taking this show on the road . We at Neustar are delighted to have coaxed Intelligence Squared away from home in New York for the first time ever , bringing it here to Washington , D.C. Clearly , just the packed house here tonight shows that there 's a true hunger for intelligent and civil discourse that 's Intelligence Squared 's hallmark . There 's much the nation 's capital can learn from Intelligence Squared , and we 're excited for this evening to get started . This is a timely topic , so I wo n't take up any more time . Instead , I turn the stage over to John Donvan , and our distinguished panelists . </s>
Can I invite one more round of applause for both Robert and Jeff ? Welcome , everyone , to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News , and once again it is my pleasure and my honor to serve as moderator , as the four debaters you see sharing the stage with me here at the Newseum , and it 's our first debate outside of New York City . </s>
Four debaters , two against two , will be debating this motion : `` The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated . '' Now , you in the audience have a special role , and I just want to divert very briefly while I talk about that . </s>
We 've already mentioned that WAMU is a partner in this evening , and they obviously did a very , very good job in bringing all of you out here on this evening . And we are aware of the fact that Conan O'Brien who 's doing his 30-city tour , this is his night in Washington , and we are aware of the fact that James Taylor and Carole King -- that does n't happen very often -- they 're singing together four blocks away . And mostly , we are aware of the fact that at National 's Stadium , Steve Strasburg is taking the mound for the first time . So , the fact that all of you are here for a security policy discussion , debate in really , anywhere else but Washington , D.C. -- the words `` wonk fest '' will not escape my lips , but I do want to congratulate all of you for being here . </s>
And here is the reason . </s>
This is a debate . </s>
It is a contest . </s>
There will be winners and losers , and you , our audience , have a special role . You are the judges . By the time the debate has ended , you will have been asked to vote twice : once before and once again after the debate . And the team that has changed the most of your minds on this motion will be declared our winner . Let 's go to the first vote now . </s>
To the right of your seats , there is a keypad . If you agree with our motion , `` The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated , '' if you agree , push number one . </s>
If you disagree , or if you 're with the side that is arguing against , you push number two . And if you’re undecided , push number three . </s>
All right , looks like from everybody’s faces that we have passed that test . So we’ll have the results in a short while . We’ll share with you what the opening , what the preliminary vote is , after it’s tabulated . And then once again at the end , we’ll go to the second vote and that’s how we’ll choose our winner . </s>
So onto round one : opening statements by each debater in turn . Seven minutes each . </s>
Marc , you can make your way to your lectern . I’d like to introduce arguing for the motion , that the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated , Marc Rotenberg who is executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center . </s>
He has been , since before most of us were familiar with the Internet , a fierce advocate for our privacy . In fact , he has taken on internet behemoth Google , filing Federal Trade Commission complaints against Google on the grounds of possibly violating privacy . </s>
That’s the kind of man he is ; those are his issues ; I’d like to introduce Marc Rotenberg , but I’m curious to know , do we need to worry more about China or you , if we’re Google ? Thank you so much John , and thank you all for being here tonight . I wanted to begin also by thanking Intelligence Squared and the Rosenkranz Foundation and Neustar for hosting this event . This is an important issue ; this is one of those issues that’s being discussed here in Washington , in Congress and the White House and your views , your assessment of want the country should do with regard to the threat of cyber warfare is very important and we thank you for being here tonight . </s>
We’re going to ask you tonight to consider the proposition of whether the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated . Keep in mind the statement of the proposition . We’re not talking about cyber attack , cyber concerns , cyber worry , or not being able to boot up your email . This is a debate about cyber war and how serious that threat is . </s>
I’d like to share with you a few statements that I uncovered as I was preparing for this debate . </s>
One of the leading experts on cyber war said , “Digital Pearl Harbors are happening every day.” </s>
The person who has been named to head the U.S. cyber command , the current director of the National Security Agency said “U.S . military networks are seeing hundreds of thousands of probes a day.” And one of our opponents in the debate tonight has compared the threat of cyber warfare with nuclear war . Now Bruce and I are going to try to explain to you why it is that we believe that these statements overstate the problem . We are certainly aware of the full range of risks to the Internet and there are many different actors out there . </s>
Some of them with criminal intent , some of them are spies ; some of them are just curious . We used to call them hackers in the good ole days . </s>
All of them pose various types of threat to the Internet as we know it , but if we reduce all of these threats to the catch-all of cyber war , I am concerned that it will take our country in a direction that we will very much regret . </s>
But tonight we are not only going to try to persuade you that the threat of cyber war has in fact been grossly exaggerated , we are going to try to explain to you why this has happened . </s>
In fact , what you are hearing now about the threat of cyber war is part of a long running campaign here in Washington to move control of the Internet , the technical standards and the openness that we have enjoyed away from its current model to one that would give the intelligence community and the National Security Agency much greater authority to decide what people may or may not do on the Internet . And that effort has been underway long before the stories that you will hear tonight about Russian hackers and Chinese plans to take over the Internet and even attacks launched from North Korea . Back in the 1970s , the NSA worried about the public availability of encryption ; the key security standard that today makes possible the routine transactions you engage in when you buy a book on Amazon or download a song from iTunes . </s>
NSA did n't want that encryption technology widely available , and they fought against it . </s>
Fortunately , computer researchers pressed on , and encryption became widely available and provided a key technique to make possible secure online transactions . But then , in the 1980s , along came John Poindexter who would later come up with Total Information Awareness , and he worried about unsecured private computer networks -- does any of this sound familiar -- back in 1984 . And he wanted the National Security Agency to be responsible for computer security in the United States . Fortunately , the Congress did n't like that idea . They pressed back on Mr. Poindexter and the White House , and we established open standards to safeguard network security , but this is not the end of the story . </s>
Because then again in the early 1990s , as encryption was becoming more widely available and the NSA worried that they could not intercept private communications , they said to Internet users and American business , `` You have to use a new technology that we 've developed , called Clipper , the escrow key encryption standard . Anytime you want to send a private e-mail , we need a copy of that key that you used to encrypt your communication because we want to be able to know what is contained in your private messages . '' And again , Congress pushed back and Internet users pushed back , and the Clipper chip proposal put forward by the NSA in the early 1990s was rejected . The story continues . </s>
After 9-11 , NSA was there again arguing for control of the Internet to try to protect our nation against terror attacks . Now , do n't misunderstand our argument tonight . We are aware of these threats , and we are not going to try to persuade you that there are not threats out there that are serious and real and that we should ignore . That is not our argument . </s>
Our argument is that we have to be very careful about allowing a single , secret , unaccountable government agency , which has been fighting for 25 years to take control of Internet security , to become the dominant authority for the Internet , which is what will happen if you accept the proposition that the threat of cyber war has not been grossly exaggerated . So , we urge you this evening not only to side with our side , to agree that this threat has been exaggerated , but also to understand why it has been exaggerated . There are agencies in Washington that want very much to know what 's in your e-mail . They want to know when you log online . They want to be able to build big databases and detect patters . </s>
And this is the threat that Bruce and I will try to respond to . Thank you . </s>
Thank you , Marc Rotenberg . Our motion is , `` The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated , '' and first up to argue against the motion , I 'd like to introduce Mike McConnell . Now , speaking about experience , not only was he a vice admiral in the Navy where he did a significant amount of intelligence work , he went on to become former director of national intelligence , making him the nation 's top intelligence officer . Also in his career , he was director of the National Security Agency . </s>
Mike , does it get more inside than that ? Well , a few things , not too many . But nothing you 're going to share tonight . </s>
Well , actually I am going to share a little bit of a story that -- Terrific . -- goes with that long history . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Michael McConnell . The translation -- </s>
Thank you . The translation of experience is age . The bad news is age . The good news is grandchildren . But let me humanize just a second . </s>
A little under the weather . Two grandsons come to see me . The oldest runs into the room and says , `` Grandpa , Grandpa , make a sound like a frog . '' </s>
And I said , `` Son , what for ? '' He said , `` We 're talking to Grandma and she said as soon as you croak , she 's taking us all to Disney Land . '' </s>
That 's what age does for you . Let me compliment Marc on his argument . </s>
And I want to say up front , I agree with everything Marc said about the essence of what makes us Americans : privacy and civil liberties . However , I disagree and urge you to vote against this proposition because of how he framed it . Let me just quote , “Our argument is do not let a single authority , the National Security Agency , ” agency I was chosen to lead , “control the Internet.” </s>
It has nothing to do - it has nothing to do with this debate . Now -- I want to just , if you’ll bear with me for just a second , just a small amount of time here ; I want to make reference to people who are informed at the highest level with all of the information : our last three presidents . </s>
President Clinton focused on this subject ; he had a special panel review it and he concluded that it was critical to the nation that we move to address this set of vulnerabilities . President Bush who I had the pleasure to serve along with serving President Obama , said , and I’ll just quote , “in the last few years , threats in cyber security have risen dramatically . </s>
The policy of the United States is to protect against the debilitating disruption of operations in our information systems for critical infrastructures.” Later , when I had a chance to serve on the inside again , I made my case to President Bush and he supported a comprehensive national cyber security initiative . The Congress agreed and a bill was passed . Now , we’ve got a new administration . </s>
The new administration did not agree with the previous administration , huge policy differences in every dimension . We made our case to President Obama and he said , “I will take it under review.” After reviewing it for a considerable period of time , he said , one year ago , we meet today at a transformational moment , a moment in history , when our inter-connected world presents at once with great promise but also great peril . </s>
It’s the great irony of our information age , the very technologies that empower us to create and to build also empower those who would disrupt and destroy . The key is disrupt and destroy . I’m not talking about hackers . I’m not talking about criminals , lots of statistics . I’m not even talking about China and what China has done to take information out of this country . </s>
I’m talking about destruction of data . </s>
Let me give you just a way to think about it . The United States economy is $ 14 trillion a year . Two banks in New York City move $ 7 trillion a day . On a good day , they do eight trillion . </s>
Now think about that . Our economy is $ 14 trillion . Two banks are moving $ 7 trillion to $ 8 trillion a day . </s>
There is no gold ; they’re not even printed dollar bills . </s>
All of those transactions , all those transactions are massive reconciliation and accounting . If those who wish us ill , if someone with a different world view was successful in attacking that information and destroying the data , it could have a devastating impact , not only on the nation , but the globe . And that’s the issue that we’re really debating . We are so inter- connected ; we have enjoyed the benefits of the information technology revolution . It’s touched everyone in this room . </s>
From the time you got up this morning in an air conditioned space ; you bought gasoline for your car with a credit card . You do online banking ; you have power routed to your home . </s>
We’re on a path to increase the digitization of the country . Medical care will be improved because of information technology . We can move the information ; we can understand trends and we can protect privacy . </s>
And the arguments that our opponents are going to mount are this is an argument about privacy and civil liberties ; it is not . We can have both . I was privileged to serve the National Security Agency as its director . I was there for the debate over clipper chip and the other things that were mentioned . </s>
What I would encourage you to do , since I’m going to be out of time in just a second , is bring that topic up when we have a chance to have the dialogue with questions from the audience . </s>
And I will tell the story from a little bit different perspective . I did serve on the inside ; I have served on the outside , so I’ve had the privilege of seeing it from both sides . </s>
That’s not fair to you the audience , because I live in a classified world . </s>
We have a system of representative government . Those representatives that speak for you are cleared ; they’re informed ; their responsibility is oversight . The equivalent of the National Security Agency was breaking Nazi Germany’s code in World War II . Historians argue that that probably shortened the war by 18 months to two years , saved countless lives and incredible resources . </s>
Did the American people have the right to know that NSA was breaking Nazi Germany code in World War II ? </s>
Because if they had known , the Germans would have known , and all they had to do was take it away by changing the rotors . Secrecy gets a very bad name in our society . American citizens do n't like spies in spite of the fact that the first spy master was George Washington . Secrecy is a necessity . And I would summarize by saying we have laws and the key is getting the law correct . </s>
If the law is written appropriately and there is the appropriate oversight committee , if you violate the law , you will be held accountable . In a nation as free and as wonderful as ours is , leading the world in human rights and privacy and civil liberties , it 's getting the debate framed right to mitigate the risk , to protect the nation consistent with our values and our laws . </s>
I urge you to vote against this resolution . Thank you , Mike McConnell . So , we are halfway through the opening statements of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have four debaters , two teams of two , who are arguing out this motion : The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated . </s>
You 've heard the first two opening statements , now onto the third . Bruce Schneier has a position in a company and also a position in the culture . </s>
He is the chief security technology officer of BT , but he is more than that . If you listen to him on any YouTube video , he is a thinker , he is a philosopher , a man who has taken the topic of security to the human soul , asking questions like what is trust and when do we know it and when do we recognize it . So , he gets the title guru . And I want to ask you since our radio audience ca n't see you , the ponytail , is that a guru thing , or do you just like it ? </s>
Actually , I think it 's an East Coast crypto thing . Okay . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Bruce Schneier . </s>
So , we 're here today to debate the motion that the threat of cyber war is grossly exaggerated . And I also , in preparing , read a book full of articles and have some choice quotes . Mike McConnell said in an op-ed in the Washington Post in February of this year that the United States is fighting a cyber war today and we 're losing . </s>
So , cyber war is going on right now in our country . Amit Yoran , who did cyber policy , cyber security under Bush , I believe , said that cyber 9/11 has happened over the past 10 years , but it 's happened so slowly that we do n't see it . </s>
So , 9/11 , you know , thousands of people dead , billions of dollars of damage , has happened , and we just did n't notice it like the cyber war we 're currently losing . In 2007 , Germany -- and it 's a great -- this is a great newspaper headline -- `` Germany attacks China for starting the cyber war . '' This is actually great because when Germany attacks China , they are attacking them by yelling at them because China started a cyber war . </s>
Another headline , same incident : `` China declares war on western search sites . '' You can actually declare cyber war on search engines . I do n't know if you knew that . </s>
An article from an Australian magazine , The Independent , February of this year : `` Hackers declare cyber war on Australia . '' So , cyber war is so easy , even kids can do it . This year , London Times , March of this year : `` Cyber war declared as China hunts for the West 's intelligence secrets . '' And last year -- actually , Fourth of July last year there was a cyber war in the United States , headlines all over the place . I have one from the Wall Street Journal : `` Cyber blitz hits U.S. and Korea . '' </s>
In this instance , there were some denial-of-service attacks against Web sites in South Korea and the United States , which happen , we think , from North Korea . There were a bunch of congressmen actually proposing that we attack Korea in response , except we think the attacks might have come from the U.K. , which would have been awkward , or , actually , from Florida , which would have been really awkward . </s>
Okay , so this is silly , right ? </s>
I mean , when we talk about cyber war in the headlines , in the rhetoric , we 're not talking about war . </s>
This is a rhetorical war , right ? It 's the war on drugs , it 's the war on poverty . </s>
It 's a really neat way of phrasing it to get people 's attention , right , and to make an interesting headline . Now , what 's going on really is a blurring of the threats . There are a lot of threats out there . Cyber war is one , cyber crime ; we’ve heard about cyber terrorism , cyber-hooliganism , cyber activism . </s>
And it often can be really hard to figure out what’s happening . And just think about how we respond to these sorts of threats . When something happens to us , it can be the response from the FBI or from the military or from the Secret Service or from Homeland Security and it depends on who’s attacking us and why . </s>
And when we don’t know who’s attacking us and why , it can be very easy to call it war . But in most cases , it’s not , right ? There’s a lot -- and -- I took quick notes , I probably got them wrong , some of McConnell’s statements , some of the quotes about , that we need to address the vulnerabilities , that the threats in cyber security have risen dramatically . </s>
Again , we’re hearing -- yes these are true , there are threats , there are vulnerabilities ; cyber security’s a big deal , but they’re not war threats . Probably in the debate later , we’re going to go into some of the examples of cyber war . I just mentioned Korea attacking the U.S. A big one was in Estonia ; it’s been called the first cyber war . And basically , someone or some country , some believe it’s Russia , announced a denial of service attack against a bunch of Estonia websites , so it’s kind of like the army marches into your country and then gets in line at the motor vehicle bureau so you can’t get your driver’s license renewed . </s>
That’s sort of what that looks like . The only person they’ve ever found who they can convict of this was a 22 year old Russian living in Tallinn who was annoyed about a statue falling down . </s>
So I mean , we’re now where we can’t tell foreign invaders from bored kids . </s>
The other events we talk about , China was mentioned a little bit . </s>
I mean yes , there’s a huge intelligence threat . </s>
China’s doing a lot of targeting against Google , against others . </s>
Marc mentioned the enormous number of attacks per day against government networks . That number actually is pretty reasonable for all of your computers as well . We’re talking about different worms and viruses ; lots of threats , again not cyber war . So , I urge you to really think critically about what we’re talking about . Metaphors matter . </s>
If we frame this discussion as a war discussion , then what you do when there’s a threat of war is you call in the military and you get military solutions . </s>
You get lockdown ; you get an enemy that needs to be subdued . If you think about these threats in terms of crime , you get police solutions . And as we have this debate , not just on stage , but in the country , the way we frame it , the way we talk about it ; the way the headlines read , determine what sort of solutions we want , make us feel better . </s>
And so the threat of cyber war is being grossly exaggerated and I think it’s being done for a reason . This is a power grab by government . What Mike McConnell didn’t mention is that grossly exaggerating a threat of cyber war is incredibly profitable . </s>
The last article I saw said there’s about $ 400 million in Booz Allen contracts on cyber war . You don’t get those by saying you know , this is kind of dumb . But , it really is . The threats are real ; the threats are serious ; cyber space is not a safe place , but these are not war threats . </s>
For the threat of cyber war to be serious means you believe the threat of war is serious . And if you’re not worried about war , -- you can’t be more worried about cyber war ; that just doesn’t make sense . </s>
I guess I’ll be back when it’s discussion time . Thank you , Bruce Schneier . Our motion is , “The cyber war threat has been greatly exaggerated , ” and now to argue against that motion I want to introduce Jonathan Zittrain who is a professor of Internet Law at Harvard , who a couple of years back , said the great thing about teaching Internet law is that those who study it don’t really know what it is yet . </s>
I thought it was that they taught gym . I got the quote wrong . Have things changed ? Well . Jonathan Zittrain . </s>
Thank you . </s>
Thank you so much . Thank you to the Rosenkranz Foundation , Intelligence Squared , and thank you Bruce for promising not to hack the voting devices that we 're using tonight in the program . </s>
So , here 's where we 're at so far . Marc says , `` Vote for us if you do n't want a police state . '' </s>
Bruce says , `` Vote for us if you think journalists and their headline writers and sometimes their sources exaggerate , '' and , `` Vote for us if you do n't want a military state . '' </s>
So , I stand here proudly before you in the negative , despite the fact that I do not want a police state . I do think that journalists and their headline writers sometimes exaggerate -- is it okay to say that in the Newseum ? Is that all right ? Did you see , by the way , if you 're particularly a fan of the news , you can live here . There are Newseum residences , which is -- </s>
There 's like a bat pole and you can go down and read the headlines . </s>
I ca n't believe I 've just used a minute in this opening , but -- and we all agree that the use of the word `` cyber '' is probably a bridge too far . If you at least agree with that , please send me -- Yes . You can applaud or send me some cyber mail , and I will send you a reply . </s>
What we heard from Mike were some scenarios that were kind of the watershed event scenarios , and I do n't know about you , but after his rip on the banking system , I might be going to my nearest ATM and purchasing a brand-new hollow mattress . I want to give a more gradual view of the vulnerabilities that you 'll notice both Bruce and Marc handily acknowledge . </s>
`` Oh , we 're not saying the system works . </s>
In fact , we agree it 's utterly vulnerable . We just do n't like the use of the word 'war , ' and we do n't like the use of the word ‘war ' because it might give people a platform through which to have bad things happen after that , to militarize or to create a police state or something like that . '' </s>
Well , fine . We have to argue against that , but let us be truth-tellers about the state of vulnerability in our networks and our endpoints , and then deal with it from there , neither exaggerating nor understating it . </s>
So , what kind of threat am I talking about ? Let me just give you two quick examples . </s>
The network itself . The Internet is an utterly bizarre network , and to answer your question , John , the more I study it , the more I am just agog that it functions at all . </s>
And there are plenty of Internet engineers who -- -- remain puzzled and say , well , it 's just a pilot project . The jury 's still out . So , for example , to get a piece of data from one end to another , like this pen up to the back of the room , the sane , rational way to do it would be to hire somebody , to have a Newseum employee who would take it up there , and then if it did n't get there , we would know whom to blame . Call it the FedEx method of getting it there . </s>
The way the Internet does it is basically like a big bucket brigade . I pass it to the front row , it goes back , would you mind , would you mind , or for sports fans , kind of like beer at a Red Sox game , right ? </s>
You gain nothing except soiled trousers by doing it , but there is a strong normative presumption that you will pass the beer . Now , this also leads to structural vulnerability , because if you drink the beer or if you pass it forward instead of sideways , it does n't get to where it 's going . And it turns out that in 2008 , the state of Pakistan , as is its wont , asked its Internet service providers to prevent people in Pakistan from getting the YouTube . There was something there that they did n't like . And one ISP , as kind of a parlor trick , chose to implement that block by announcing within the stands of fans that are ISPs here , that it , in fact , was YouTube . </s>
And this is a decentralized system . So , its announcement meant that packets that would otherwise be going to YouTube went to them from their subscribers . </s>
And then it resonated like ripples in a pond from one ISP to another like dominoes until with about two minutes , anywhere in the world , if you were trying to get to YouTube , your packets were going to Pakistan and they were n't coming back . Now , that is not only downright weird , it is an example of just a whole genus of vulnerabilities that are extremely difficult to fix . Now , was that an act of war ? Definitely not . </s>
Is it a vulnerability such that if you had malice towards a state that relies asymmetrically on this network and decided that you wanted to use this as an instrument of your aggression , could you do so ? Absolutely , and I do not believe you will hear them say otherwise . That 's why you hear Bruce saying against the straw people of `` there 's a cyber war already in progress . '' All right , I do n't think there 's a cyber war going on right now against us in America , but boy are the vulnerabilities there . </s>
So long as there is the vulnerability , all we need is the motivation , and I do n't want to rest on the good graces of any state around the world , or for that matter any 12-year-old , that wants to try to take down the net . And , he 's not 12 , but I did ask Ed Felten , computer scientist at Princeton , once , I said , `` You know , if you 're in a 24- like scenario and your life depended on it , and you had to bring down huge swathes of the net and you only had a week to do it , kind of planting the seeds in the head I said could you do it . And he thought about it really careful , and he said , could I have two weeks ? And that’s the kind of thing that did not make me feel better . </s>
Now , Robert Rosencranz , one of our hosts , mentioned GhostNet , our collaborators in the Open Net initiative at Toronto and up at Harvard , worked to expose this network that they named GhostNet where basically this wasn’t run of the mill Trojans that all of us have right now on our machines while we think we’re playing solitaire and in fact our machines are spamming each other . This isn’t a run of the mill Trojan ; these are the ones targeted to particular people and institutions that a government might have interest in , compromising the machines and leaving them open on average for over 200 days , where they’ve got the keys to the kingdom . They can surveil everything ; they can control the machine . </s>
How do we know ? Because our researchers hacked that system and then could see what they saw . </s>
We saw the ministries of foreign affairs of Iran , Bangladesh , Latvia , Indonesia , the Philippines , and Brunei , open to us , if all we wanted to do was grab the files . The embassies of Germany , Romania , Cyprus , the Associated Press , not the embassy , the Associated Press itself , and NATO headquarters , exposed through our view of this system . That’s something that says to me , to the extent that surveillance and spy craft is an instrument of war , war is what you have . So I am concerned as , is I think everybody here about protecting civil liberties , about not having the responses to this problem be too quick , too panicked , too corporate , or too military . </s>
There are solutions that I hope we can talk about in the panel , to avoid too far in any of those directions . But let us be clear about the problem . Thank you . Thank you , Jonathan Zittrain . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being argued is the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated . </s>
And we now have the results of our preliminary vote where you , our live audience are judges in this debate , registered your stance on this motion before the debate began . Here are the numbers . Our motion is the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated . Before the debate , 24 percent of you agreed with you motion , 54 percent disagreed , and 22 percent were undecided . </s>
That’s where things started ; we will ask you to vote once again at the conclusion of the debate and the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner . Now , on to round two where the debaters address each other directly and answer questions from the audience and from me . We have here in Washington D.C. at the Newseum , two teams of two . We have Marc Rotenberg , the security activist , and Bruce Schneir , the security specialist and internet philosopher who are arguing that the other side’s argument really is a red herring intended to lead to a power grab by the military . The side arguing against is saying that we are terribly vulnerable to a list of vulnerabilities and that the stakes are enormously high if the damage were done , the damage would be something that we almost could not recover from . </s>
I’m John Donvan moderating and I have an initial question and my question is to the side that is arguing for the motion . You have heard what the other side has said and you have described what you have heard as not being a situation that deserves to be described as war , but what kind of collection of vulnerabilities or what sort of action would actually be for you , be an unexaggerated threat of cyber war . What would it take for you to abandon this motion ? I guess for cyber war , you need war . Bruce Schnier . </s>
So tanks would be nice . Maybe some bombs . It’s -- one of the rhetoric we hear is a cyber Pearl Harbor , which is an opening salvo to cyber war . I’m thinking of a fleet ; that would work . </s>
Bruce , the motion isn’t there is a war . The motion is about a threat . Right , what I would need to see for cyber war ; I guess I would need nation hostilities that are warlike . </s>
I mean , I would have to be fearful of war . </s>
I would have to be fearful that Canada would roll over into the United States . </s>
Now if I was worried Canada would do that , I would worry about Canada’s cyber command and cyber capabilities , and I would worry about the cyber threats from Canada . As long as I feel safe against war , I just don’t think the subset of war is going to bother me . So you’re talking about damage we can hardly recover from . A lot of that happens by accident . </s>
We saw -- it was a couple years ago , three undersea cables were cut going into Egypt . Now , this was kind of a weird coincidence maybe , or maybe it was some kind of intelligence action . But that 's a pretty big threat . </s>
You can imagine that as a war-type threat . And it was something that was recoverable from . The power blackout in 2003 hit I think D.C. , the northeast part of the United States , southeast part of Canada . You know , that was a series of events . One of them seems to have been the Blaster Worm . </s>
I mean , the guy who wrote the worm could n't have predicted on a bet that that would have resulted in that . </s>
Let me bring -- But cyber action . </s>
But again , it 's a war . Let me get a response from Mike McConnell on the other side . Thank you very much , John . When Bruce spoke at the beginning , he said , `` Mike McConnell said the U.S. is fighting a cyber war today , and we are losing . '' That’s not in fact exactly what I said . </s>
What I said is if we were in a cyber war , we would lose . And I was making that statement somewhat metaphorically . And let 's think about the terms we 're using : cyber war , Cold War . Did we have a Cold War ? For those of you in the audience about my age , you probably really experienced that . </s>
The issue is there was a Cold War . We had a nation state who , if the United Nations banged on the podium and said , `` We will bury you , '' there were risks , and we prepared . When we prepared , we prevailed . We won the Cold War . </s>
And if I had to do it over again , maybe I would use the word conflict or battle as opposed to war . So I want to highlight we 're talking about the threat . There are vulnerabilities . </s>
They can not be denied . Every member of this panel in this debate would agree that there are huge vulnerabilities . So what my partner and I are attempting to be are truth sayers , as he said , provide the warning to cause our citizens to recognize the vulnerability and cause their government , their businesses and their personal behavior collectively to address these vulnerabilities so that if there 's a war we would prevail . </s>
One last thing , John . Desert Storm shocked the Chinese , shocked them . They had an army that was totally unprepared . In Desert Storm , one weapon destroyed target . Any time in history with thousands of weapons , from Desert Storm till today , the Chinese are building an army and a capability to take out the cyber capabilities of the United States , take out the eyes and ears , our strategic advantage . </s>
That 's what is currently going on in this capture of information , moving terabytes of data . Marc Rotenberg , I mean , some of this can turn into a little bit of a semantic tangle . </s>
Right . </s>
But Mike McConnell brought up an interesting semantic move when he said cyber war , Cold War . The Cold War did n't turn into actual combat and invasions , and yet we all know what that meant . </s>
Respond to that , please , whether that works or not . Yeah , I do n't think it works . And I think the point that Bruce was driving at is , look , when we talk about war , war , we 're talking about one nation state going after another nation state with the intent to decimate its economy , you know , overrun its land , you know , threaten its people . That 's what war is about . </s>
And in Washington , even when we 're at war , we 're reluctant to say we 're at war . So we use this word , you know , very , very carefully . And if I could have just one more moment , I 'm actually a little bit surprised by some of Mike McConnell 's earlier comments about the role of the NSA in all of this . He seemed surprised that I was talking about the NSA in my opening remarks and the context of this debate . </s>
But this debate is entirely about the role of NSA . </s>
And the Congress knows this because it was the NSA director who recently went before the Congress to be nominated as the head of US cyber command . This person is now responsible for coordinating the military response for the United States in the area of cyber security . It did n't have to be the NSA . It could have been the Department of Homeland Security . It could have been the commerce department . </s>
It could have been -- well , stay with me on this , will you ? It 's an option , right ? It 's an option . But there is an obvious reason . You know , and all of Mike 's family and friends who are here tonight siding with him understand what I 'm talking about . </s>
This argument for cyber war is an argument for the Department of Defense for the National Security Agency to take the lead on cyber security in the United States . And this is a debate we 've had now for 25 years . And what I tried to do in my opening statement was to remind all you folks what our experience with that has been . It 's the experience of clipper . It 's the experience of classified responses . </s>
I 'm going to -- since you 're going back to your opening statement , let me interrupt and go to Jonathan Zittrain to respond to what you just heard . </s>
Well , a little bit , there is a little bit of philosophical thing going on here where it 's like is this a chair ? You know , like , well , it has three legs and not four . And I never saw somebody sit on it , but you could . And I mean , you know , the boundaries of a chair gets fuzzy . So what makes a war a war ? </s>
Well , we 've heard a couple things . Who are the actors involved ? </s>
If the person initiating the hurling of a stone at someone is a state actor , could it be a war ? Well , if the stone hit somebody from another state , if a South Korean soldier in the demilitarized zone hurls a stone at his North Korean counterpart , squarely trying to hit him , is that an act of war ? </s>
Is that an act of war , Mike ? </s>
I think it might be . I think it might be too . Let 's just say that we should not try that experiment right now . You know ? Worse has happened on that peninsula , and it started from lesser things . </s>
And then you look , all right , what 's the motive and what 's the effect ? Now , what I hear is , yes , the canonical , platonic form of war is like the digital representation -- this is for a younger generation . </s>
In the “Lord of the Rings” series , when all those monsters are going up against each other , all right , that 's a war . Right ? That 's a Platonic form . But you can take away a leg or two and still have the fundamental truth be , one , are we exposed ? Absolutely . </s>
And what are we exposed to ? It may not be a bomb coming down our middle chimney of our house , but it could be something that greatly affects our way of life . If you indulge Mike 's hypothetical and say what if tomorrow those two banks could be taken out , and suddenly everybody that had some claim to those $ 7 trillion has no idea to whom it belongs , nor can they prove it . Seems to me that 's a predicate with the right actors in place to be an act of war . </s>
Jonathan , this seems to boil down to -- and I do n't want to get into this rhetorical tangle here . Yeah . </s>
But the word `` threat '' is in there , and it seems to -- Yes . -- the word `` threat '' means something that could happen . And the question is you are saying we should be really , really , really , worried about what could happen . And you 're saying not so much . </s>
And you 're saying they have motives for trying to scare us . But are you ever -- and you know what damage can be done . </s>
Bruce , that 's what you do for a living is protect -- is protect a company . Are you -- are you able to sleep at night in terms of the stuff that could happen ? So this is actually interesting . As security guys , we tend to think all about the bad stuff . </s>
But , I mean , you go out in the audience , your bank account 's actually fine , all right ? Your identity has n't been stolen tonight . We talk a lot about the threats . </s>
And in my business , we have conferences on the threats . </s>
You write papers on the threats . All we do is threats . But actually most of the world works pretty well pretty much all the time . </s>
The internet works . The pens go to the back of the room , the beer gets passed , and life goes on . </s>
Yes , there are vulnerabilities , but the networks , right , I mean sure -- yes , there 's espionage going on . A lot of companies keep a lot of secrets ? So , yeah , it 's easy to sleep at night because we are safe . By and large , we are safe . Yes , there are threats . </s>
There are common threats . I mean , you could look at the number of -- amount of money stolen from identity theft , right , some cyber crime . And it 's a big number . </s>
But it 's a much bigger number , money that is n't stolen . Yes , there 's bad stuff going on , but it 's rare . </s>
It 's in the noise . We are safe . Three very important words . Are we -- Jonathan , respond to are we safe ? </s>
No , we are not safe . I wanted to put to Bruce the question I said I put to Ed . Bruce , if you had a crack team , NSA left you a team of good spooks , and you have two weeks -- -- not signing them up just yet . </s>
You have two weeks , and you have to wreak maximum havoc among the devices in consumer land . The people you just told should feel safe in their homes and businesses . You have to wreak maximum havoc . I know it 's against interests to answer it . </s>
But tell me just how far could you go ? So , we talk about this . And actually , after -- in crypto conferences , security conferences , people get beers at the end of the night . And we have these conversations . And -- </s>
-- I mean , there 's a side that -- This is just among us here . Right . There 's a side that says , well , you know , new introduction of a Microsoft operating system is indistinguishable from a big denial of service attack . </s>
So , you know , you 've got these sorts of things happening -- </s>
We have these things happening sort of normally . We had an AT & T satellite go out because of software updates , and a lot of people 's pagers did n't work . </s>
These sorts of things do happen . You can do damage but we recover . We 're actually really good at recovering . And I do n't think given two weeks and a crack team , you could take down the internet . </s>
You could make people real annoyed . You can make -- actually probably get paid overtime -- but the techies who have to fix their computers and networks are going to have a bunch of sleepless nights , but it 's not going to take down the -- it 's not going to do irreparable damage to our country , to our society . This is not an existential threat . I mean , nothing like that ; this is around the edges . Okay . </s>
I want to in a moment go to questions from the audience , so I want to start that process . </s>
We 'll get the microphones out there and once again I want to remind you to hold the microphone a fist 's distance away from your mouth , to really ask a question that is a question , and to try to keep it on our topic , and we 'll come to you in just a moment . But Mike McConnell , I want to give you a chance to respond to what you just heard . I want to go back to the word , `` war , '' and just remind the audience , Cold War , there were no Russians marching down Pennsylvania Avenue until we won . And they were on the friendly side . </s>
So this -- careful of the use of the word `` war . '' Marc said that 's a nation state attacking another nation state , we did not exchange nuclear weapons with the Soviets . We prevailed in that war . It 's the metaphor of war . Now , also , Marc , earlier in our introduction , accused me of tapping his telephone , and he also just made reference to me stacking the audience with family and friends . </s>
Now , I would love to have done that however it is against the law -- it is against the law to tap Marc 's telephone -- You got it . -- unless he is guilty of a crime , and that goes completely out of the context of the National Security Agency and becomes a law enforcement issue which is controlled by a judiciary process . Mike , let me bring to you a question that actually goes to the issues that concern Marc . </s>
There is a bill that 's sort of sitting in the Senate , a lot of cyber -- to address cyber threat , and one of the provisions in the bill was to give the president the power to disconnect a company or to disconnect even a government agency from the Internet if he thought it was a threat . And ultimately that provision slipped away because of pressure from groups like Marc . Do you think it was a mistake for that provision to go away ? If you -- </s>
No , I do not . I do not . But let me just add a little more context , there are now 40 , 40 -- four zero -- bills , resolutions , or amendments on the Hill circulating , and let me remind you of what Mark Twain said about that . No man 's life , liberty , or property are safe while the legislature is in session . </s>
This is a debate that involves you in this room , the citizens , being informed about this process , the scare tactics of the government tapping your telephone ; that can not happen with the right law . Oh , my God . </s>
It can not happen without the right -- without the law . Does the phrase “warrantless wiretapping '' mean anything this evening ? </s>
I mean , come on , Mike , let 's be serious . The past administration violated the U.S. Constitution and you pushed for -- </s>
Is it appropriate to be interrupted -- Yeah . </s>
Actually , I -- -- that no one would be held accountable . -- all of that may be true but it 's actually a different debate . </s>
That 's an incredible statement . That 's a different debate . And , Mike , I want to go back to the question -- But we should go to that debate . That 's what this debate is . </s>
we 'll be back and we 'll book it . Notice that -- </s>
I want you to go to my question , why do n't you want to give the president the power to do this ? Because the president can put troops on the street , he can close down ports , why not give the president the power to -- </s>
Notice that Marc came for a different debate . </s>
Now , let me answer your question . </s>
You do n't want to concentrate that kind of power with a bill on the Hill that is not thought out . </s>
My argument is this is very , very complex . My opposition here made reference to my comments about Cold War and nuclear weapons . The reason I made that reference is we did n't know what to do with nuclear weapons . We did n't know how to control them . </s>
We did n't know what our doctrine would be and so on . So in the late '40s , early '50s , we had the best minds in this country -- it was called the Solarium Project -- two things came out of that work , containment and nuclear deterrence . </s>
And what it said was never ever use them . It built the framework which allowed us to prevail in the Cold War . And that 's the argument I 'm making here . It 's not about warrantless surveillance , easy to say , hard to refute . All right , I 'd like to go to some questions from the audience now and , sir , with the microphone . </s>
Thank you for being there . </s>
And I apologize that I did n't meet you before and know your name , but there 's a gentleman in a blue shirt , and if you can rise , sir -- thank you . And I just want to wait 10 seconds so that the cameras can find you and I think that’s probably good . Okay . Go ahead , please . Good evening . </s>
This question is primarily for Mr. Schneier and Mr. Rotenberg . We’ve heard a lot of examples tonight about nefarious cyberspace activity as the defining event itself , but I think we’ve seen examples of nefarious cyberspace activities as part a more conventional conflict , when Russia invaded I believe it was Georgia . Is it grossly exaggerated to believe that nefarious cyberspace activities might be used as part of a more conventional conflict against the U.S. or one of our allies and if that is grossly exaggerated , who should be in charge of ensuring that our networks are not overrun in that event ? </s>
At least take part one of that question , yes . Mr. Schneier . I think it would be silly of anyone to think that any future war will not include a cyberspace theater , all right ? War encompasses all theaters : land , water and air space , cyberspace . </s>
War will fill the available space . This side agrees . So yes , so if there is war , there will be a cyber component . Georgia’s interesting . So Georgia was an actual tanks rolling in invasion and there were some website deface -- non-service attacks . </s>
We don’t actually know who did that . You know a lot of what we’re talking about , we talk about cyber wars , are kids playing politics . And you see it . </s>
You see Israel and Palestine , you saw U.S. and China , you know , when the U.S. spy plane had to land in China a bunch of years ago . I saw India-Pakistan when the sort of nuclear tests were going on . </s>
I mean , you see this all the time that it’s cyber-activism , it’s kids playing politics and we actually don’t know . It’s sort of odd to think that as you’re rolling in tanks you’re going to make it so people can’t visit some website . They’re probably not paying attention to that right now . But if you’re someone who’s rooting for your side , that’s what you can do . So , yeah , it’s hard to know what these things were but any future war will certainly include a cyber component . </s>
Jonathan , do you have anything to add to that that moves it from where we are ? Well , we actually saw in the recent Russia-Georgia conflict a number of Georgian blocks on the web . </s>
We infer that it might be the Georgian government actually trying to keep some of its own people from getting some of the bad news too early but certainly a component of that war was a cyber strategy . And we’ve seen it in other instances , whether it’s disputed elections or other things actually attacking cyber infrastructure because information is really key and if people are confused and they don’t know what’s going on and they’re relying on the Internet , they tossed their television set or they don’t know how to work it , that’s a problem . </s>
Right . I mean , Iran’s an example of that , the elections in Iran . A lot of the information came out in cyberspace . Iranian government’s trying to block it and , you know , activists around the world trying to counter that . I mean , lots of great stuff . </s>
Not exactly war , but they were good things . John , could I add some -- Mike McConnell </s>
Let me add just a couple of facts about the Russian conflict . </s>
That cyber -- those cyber attacks were deliberate . I agree with the way that Bruce is describing it . There was a lot of piling on . But what happened was deliberate , it was rehearsed ahead of time and it was effective in shutting down the Georgian government and the Georgian government was defeated . </s>
The Russians achieved their objective and that’s an example of how you would interface in a current conventional conflict the ability to attack the other side’s capability to communicate , to coordinate , to integrate their forces . The Georgians lost . We have a question in the front row so if you could stand up , and the microphone is on its way . </s>
So , Jonathan Zittrain in his opening remarks mentioned that the Internet is broken , that people are running protocols that are insecure , and that’s it’s easier for a malicious or incompetent service provider in Pakistan to direct all of the world’s YouTube traffic to that provider . And I think Bruce and many others would agree that many consumers and people are running out of data protocols on out of date software . We’re not hearing , though , any calls for increasing National Science Foundation funding or any calls for -- So what’s your question ? </s>
The question is if the problem is that we’re running out of date software or the problem is that we have an insecure internet , why are we not calling for secure software and regulation of technology companies rather than giving power to the DOD and NSA who have never done anything to fix the Internet or fix security problems ? NSA is in the business of finding flaws , not fixing flaws . All right . The part of your question that I want to bring to Mike because it’s entirely unfocused is that the government has never done anything to protect the Internet . </s>
Is that true ? Let 's start with the fact that DARPA invented the internet . </s>
So that 's a good start place . There are two organizations that -- It wasn’t their job to secure it . True , because it was designed to be open and unassailable . </s>
However , it is what it is . There are two organizations that make encryption code for the federal government . One is the National Security Agency to protect secrets , and the other is the national institute of standards and technology for unclassified protection . </s>
There is an initiative calls CNCI , comprehensive national cyber security initiative , and it does exactly what you just said it did n't do . It is to direct funding into the national science foundation , produce a cyber corps , now it 's a word , cyber corps . What does that mean ? </s>
It means teaching kids double E and computer science and understanding so they can make this process better . </s>
If you 're old enough to remember Sputnik -- 1957 , most of you probably do n't remember that . Immediately after , we had a bill that started sending kids to school for double E and computer science . I went to college on that bill . </s>
Otherwise I would have been not able to go . </s>
So this debate is about doing what you just said . It 's not about accusing NSA of spying and warrantless surveillance or saying DOD does n't do its job . It 's about a debate that causes us to invest the resources and train our people so that we can securely rely on something we have become dependent on . Sir , what do you think of Marc Rotenberg 's concerns with the sorts of measures that you seem to be asking for when you said the government is n't doing anything about it is the sort of -- would invite the kinds of government interference that he finds scary and terrifying . I 'll bring the mic back to you . </s>
I 'm sorry . Well , I did n't say terrifying , exactly . You did n't . And I -- totally , you did n't . </s>
And that 's a very good point . The threat of him saying terrifying has been totally exaggerated . And I -- if you can be brief . But he 's concerned that the sorts of remedies that I think that you 're asking for could be disastrous for privacy . </s>
I think Marc is scared of the NSA which is not subject to any oversight . I do n't think he 's scared of a transparent process to improve internet security . Okay . </s>
So let me clarify . Tonight 's debate topic’s not whether or not Marc 's scared , okay ? We 're not going to go there . We 're having a policy discussion , a very important policy discussion . And I 'm still having a little difficulty following what Mike McConnell is saying . </s>
He said the NSA is not interested . </s>
They 're not going to get involved , not a big deal . </s>
A couple months ago , in The Washington Post , he 's writing we need to develop an early warning system to monitor cyberspace , identify intrusions , locate the source of attacks . And we must be able to do this in milliseconds . And then you say we need to reengineer the internet to make attribution , geo location , intelligence analysis and impact assessment , the result more manageable . </s>
This is exactly -- But I think he -- I think he 's fessing up to all of this . </s>
Yes , but here 's the point about it , okay ? </s>
And this is why this is a very important question . </s>
If the goal were to promote security , reliability , stability the way we talked in the internet community about responding to security threats , we would have unclassified programs . We 'd be doing education and training . We 'd be responding to user concerns . But that 's not the model that we 're moving forward now . </s>
In fact the model that Mike just described a moment ago , the CNCI is a classified document prepared by President Bush . He was there at White House meeting in 2008 . We 're still trying to get public disclosure of that document because right now we have a secret cyber security policy . We ca n't even talk about it . I mean , we can imagine what 's in it , but we do n't even know what the document says . </s>
Mike knows what the document says , but we do n't . </s>
Can I just say -- can I just say -- It 's posted on the White House website if you 'd like to read it . </s>
No , not the original document . </s>
Jonathan , can you be brief , because I want to move on . No , no , no . Do n't say that . Jonathan Zittrain of Harvard . </s>
On behalf of the negative team for this debate , I whole-heartedly support much more money to universities and research . Let there be no doubt -- </s>
Then if the gentleman with the green tie and blue -- </s>
-- our proposal for a new Maginot Line in cyberspace is moving ahead . </s>
Gentleman with the green tie and blue shirt in the very middle . </s>
You 'll never get him a microphone . This is will add 10 minutes to the debate . Give him a microphone . </s>
Do it the internet way . Sorry . </s>
Yay . Nobody drink the beer . So I 'm pleased to announce that the internet works . I really hope your question is excellent . </s>
Otherwise the internet 's failed . </s>
This question is for the team against the motion . Mr. Schneier brought up recovery , and I think this is a key difference between real war and so-called cyber war . </s>
Would you care to comment on the difficulties of the two compared to each other , recovery from a physical war and a cyber war ? I guess that 's for one of us . Who did you -- I 'll take a crack at it first , I suppose . </s>
First , note that our brethren in the affirmative set the bar at , does this create an existential threat to the country . That bar is too high , otherwise what happened in Grenada I dare say was not a war , although I think Grenada may have thought otherwise ; or Panama , or you name other conflicts that need not have existential dimensions . As I understand it , even the war of 1812 , yeah , they burned down the White House , but , you know , they did n't actually threaten the entire integrity of our country . </s>
So we want to go short of existential threat . When I think of a war , what I think of is a hostile act designed to harm quite often , and typically physically , but not always , the interests , livelihood and , you know , day to day existence of the target . And that is most certainly possible in cyberspace . And when you see it happening because a 12-year-old can do it , it 's like , yes , but it 's not the Chinese . </s>
It 's like , well , that does not make me sleep any better at night . All right . I have to do a little thing for the radio and television at this point . </s>
It will be very brief . </s>
I want to remind you , we are in round two of this Intelligence U.S. squared debate . I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . We have four debaters , two teams of two . We 're Marc Rotenberg and Bruce Schneier who are arguing for the motion , “the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated.” </s>
And arguing against that motion , Mike McConnell and Jonathan Zittrain . Oh , I mispronounce -- somebody in my ear -- the person who tells me everything to say . The NSA . -- has told -- I have to do it a second time . </s>
I apologize . </s>
The voices in your head have a friends and family plan . There 's always been a voice in my head . I slurred . We are in round two of this intelligence US squared debate . </s>
I am John Donvan of ABC News , your moderator . We have four debaters . You said “debaters” right . </s>
I counted four . We are in round two of this intelligence squared US debate . I am John Donvan of ABC - - I have to do it without everybody laughing . We are in round two of this intelligence squared US debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan of ABC News . </s>
We have four debaters , two teams of two who are debating this motion , `` The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated . '' </s>
And we are going to questions from the audience . </s>
Once again , ma'am , right there . You 're the only woman in that zone . So stand up , and a microphone will come to you . I mean the only woman raising her hand . </s>
And we 're actually seeing lots of men raise their hands , and we 'd love to hear from some more women in fact . My question is to both teams . And we talked a lot about how this is in fact a policy debate . And I would like to know what policies , concrete policies , each side would propose come out of tonight 's discussion . </s>
Excellent question . </s>
So part of the argument on our side has been the need for openness . We believe that the most robust cyber security strategy is one that 's based on openness and transparency . You know something ? That 's also been the key to the growth of the internet . We do n't think there should be classified documents . </s>
We do n't think there should be secret standards . We do n't think there should be secret agreements between companies like Google and the NSA over how to set cyber security standards for the users of services . Just to take that step in this area , we think in the long term would provide great benefit for cyber security . Mike McConnell , who actually helped make policy . The nation typically responds to one of four things . </s>
Fortunately , the most important is ballots . And even Marc would agree there 's no tampering with those . The second thing is crisis . </s>
There is a crisis , we react , sometimes in a dramatic way . The third thing is money . And the fourth thing is law . What I am arguing , or what I propose is we get the law correct . </s>
We do n't want to wait for crisis . And when I made reference earlier to the debate in the late '40s and the early '50s , it was achieved in a way that I would agree with Marc , openness . It was an open debate where we put the issues on the table , and we talked about it . And we got to the right place with the right strategy . That 's when I 'm advocating we recognize the vulnerability at a significant level where they would be attacked in war that could cause strategic damage to this country so that we elevate it and get the right policy embedded in law . </s>
Your teammate , Jonathan Zittrain . First , let me express complete support and agreement for the fragrant smoke that Marc just blew about openness and transparency . I 'm completely in favor of that , too , so if you feel supportive of that , it does n't mean you have to vote for that side because it 's about the remedy , not about the problem . But you asked a great question about the remedy and let me give you a couple thoughts on that , that I think dovetail with openness and transparency . First , yes to Chris ' question from the front row ; more money to universities and research arms that brought us the Internet to begin with -- that 's where the Darpa money went , would be great , and more concretely -- I do n't know if anybody remembers SETI at home ? </s>
This was one of these screensavers you could run instead of the flying toasters back in the day , and it would be crunching numbers from radio telescopes like that movie `` Contact , '' and at some point your computer might be , like , OMG , `` We have found extraterrestrial life . '' </s>
Many people installed that and you ended up being able to do what otherwise would take a super computer by people volunteering cycles of their computer , offered over the network , aid among people with a common goal wanting to serve humanity . </s>
And I would love to see essentially what you might call `` NATO at home , '' which is a form of mutual aid in alerting , so if your computer is having issues there 's a way it can alert nearby other computers that can learn to drive around that pothole it just hit . I 'm part of a program called Herdict , as in , verdict of the herd . I know the name is terrible , open to other ideas , but the basic plan is as you 're surfing the Net and you find you can not get there from here for whatever reason , you 're trying to get somewhere and it 's not working , you can click a button and just report that , not even to the government , to likeminded people who can then get for the first time exactly the kind of dashboard that Mike called for in his editorial so we know where the blocks are . These are concrete ideas in the spirit of mutual aid , and you do n't have to -- </s>
Jonathan , you’re rather going on . Thank you . Bruce Schneier . So I actually disagree that openness is not a remedy . </s>
Openness is a remedy . I mean , one of the problems we have in Internet security is secrecy , that when you have secret systems , you do n't know what the vulnerabilities are , you ca n't assess them , you ca n't make intelligent buying decisions and use decisions about what to choose . Openness actually is a remedy . And it is a way to improve security . The best security protocols we have in the Internet have been designed openly either by NIS , by the government , in open process , by industry through the IETF , another open process . </s>
Protocols that are developed in secret systems in secret tend not to work well . So basically I view security failures on the Internet as market failures ; that the incentives are n't aligned for whoever has the ability to secure to do it . </s>
And you can see that in identity theft , you can see that in viruses , that the people who can solve a problem do n't have the incentive to do it . And when you have those problems and you have market failures , government has to step in and sort of set those right . So I actually agree with Mike that the problem is government needs to get the policy right . </s>
We probably violently disagree on what that would look like , but that 's what I want to see . I want to see the market fails that prevent these problems , whether they 're the worms , the viruses , and all the servers attacks , the Chinese hacking , from happening . </s>
I want to see those fixed . </s>
Okay , I 'll go to another question . I just for no particular reason want to go to a part of the room I have n't been to , there 's a gentleman -- actually the gentleman who 's sitting on the stairs , since you 've been enduring that position , I think you 've earned the right . Did you say come up to the balcony ? </s>
I’m on the balcony . Do we have a microphone up there ? We do n't . </s>
I apologize . We do n't . Do you want to come down ? </s>
If one of you wants to come down , choose a representative -- We really do n't need a microphone . No , we do for the broadcast . If you 'd come on down , I promise -- but you 're going to ask a very good question , right ? Come on down , seriously , and we 'll ask a -- sir , go ahead . </s>
So the proposition that we 're being asked to vote on as the audience is that the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated . I 'd like to know what each of you would say in response to the question , how do you measure that threat ? </s>
How do you evaluate that threat ? I think we might -- I 'd like to see you rephrase that question that brings us much closer to the actual motion , because I think we could chew up a fair amount of time on that . And I actually think we 've covered it quite a bit , so I 'm going to pass on that question with respect . </s>
That 'll be edited out of the broadcast . No , no , not necessarily . </s>
Did this gentleman come down yet ? Right here . Sorry ? </s>
What I have not gotten from either team , I would like some numbers . I do n't know whether or not to be afraid , not afraid -- out of our so-called $ 14 trillion economy ; how many of those dollars are currently lost to cyber crime ? I don’t want a solution that is more expensive than what we’re trying to fix either in loss of liberty or in terms of actual dollars . How many times have our defensive systems been attacked ? </s>
How many of these attacks are simply because of sloppy configurations by corporations or the government ? Again , are there any numbers or facts ? Okay , good point , very good point . Mike McConnell . </s>
Forty-two . I’m not making fun of your question . </s>
There are lots of numbers , millions of attacks and so on . Let me put it in a little context . </s>
I did focus on the financial community because that’s one I understand a little bit better . </s>
The financial community in the United States spends 500 billion dollars a year on IT , 500 billion dollars a year on information technology support . Now that’s moving all those ones and zeroes that represent your money or other company’s money and so on . So when you talk about expensive solutions , at least when I talk to the banking community , they are hungry for a set of solutions that allows them to have higher confidence in their transactions . </s>
Now let me make my point . Banking is based on confidence . </s>
We can’t run the globe without it . So when Marc made reference earlier to my suggestion at re-engineering the Internet , I’m all for the wild , wild web as most -- as much as anyone wants to be on it but I’m arguing for when the transactions impact billions of dollars and millions of peoples -- millions of people , you probably should have a level of communicating that is robust and secure . Example : the military sends its secrets over the same physical infrastructure as those of you in this room that text . </s>
Mike , you don’t need to say that . You made that point before and I think the question really was if , you know , if we were , if these attacks were potatoes , how many pounds of potatoes do we have racked up already ? Do we know how much damage has been done ? Well , it’s a hard question to answer . There are literally billions of attacks . </s>
I can give you some numbers like that . Bruce could give you better numbers than I can , but the point is we were in a Cold War and we never exchanged nuclear weapons . We prevailed . </s>
Well , to answer his question , we don’t know ? The answer is there are many ways to answer the question with countless examples . </s>
Terabytes of data have been taken by foreign nation states out of this country that include intellectual property for businesses , it includes information from the Department of Defense , Department of State , the Congress , the aerospace engineering system , weapons designers , huge amounts of -- All right . Let me go to your opponent , Bruce Schneier . So no debate that the threat of cyber espionage is real and cyber espionage happens every day . </s>
The question is about war . You asked about the losses due to cyber crime . </s>
Unfortunately I didn’t bring my cyber crime data and they’ve forbidden us to use the Internet up here so I can’t get it . </s>
There are lots of numbers on the net and cyber crime is a very fast growing industry . I would argue if we were up here doing that the threat of cyber crime , we tend to under- exaggerate . </s>
We know that the federal government spends about $ 6 billion to $ 7 billion a year , unclassified , on cyber security . Classified you’d probably want to double that . That’s what most people believe but we don’t actually know and they won’t tell us because after that they’ll have to kill us . </s>
Lieutenant General Alexander when he was testifying for head of cyber command said the Pentagon networks are targeted by hundreds of thousands of probes per day , whatever that means . You do the numbers , you divide up the number of computers that they have , that’s about the same number of probes that you and your corporate network are targeted by . </s>
These are mostly automatic worms -- there are ways you can make these numbers really sound big . </s>
Amount of data in cyber espionage ? Sure , it’s a lot . A lot of times we don’t know . </s>
A lot of this stuff goes unreported -- Let me go to Jonathan Zittrain because we came back to we don’t know a lot about it . Right where Bruce left off , the reason it’s hard to come up with numbers is because even the definition of attack varies . If somebody scans your port , have you been attacked ? A computer port not a real life port . </s>
You don’t even know who it is necessarily . </s>
Exactly , you don’t . </s>
But let me give two statistics that I think are pretty well agreed upon that to me frame it nicely . One is that at this point , there is good confidence that over 99 percent of the e-mail sent in the world today is spam . Only one percent or less -- if you dipped into a trough of e- mail circulating , would actually be a letter to somebody with a human on the other end . </s>
That is pretty crazy . And network engineers generally say yes . But three minutes of Paris Hilton on a video is so much more bandwidth than all that email , who cares ? </s>
Just throw it out on the other end . </s>
But it says something about just how far it 's been penetrated . Statistic number two , at times , a particular Trojan or virus , a particular piece of malware crafted by one entity has been responsible by having infected lots of machines that then become spammers for over 50 percent of the spam on a given day . And that shows just the extent to which you could have a state change , where one particular well-crafted Trojan could have such an impact on the environment . And that gets back to the question about the threat . I measure the threat by the delta , the difference between the day-to-day world we experience right now in cyberspace and the potential , the plausible potential , not fake , but the plausible potential for a huge change in the way we experience it . </s>
I want to -- Dan , do he have time for one more question ? Okay , we have time for one more . </s>
And , sir , beard , tattoos . </s>
The only one . So this question is mainly for the folks on the -- </s>
Against side ? Yeah . What I wanted to look at here was , the discussion was organizations that are going to control the internet you know , focused in the beginning . </s>
Can you -- I need you to keep the mic close and also just to get to the point of the question , please . Thanks . Okay . </s>
Between the FBI , NSA and the red team , it 's true that not one organization is currently or will be running the internet . But is this war , or is this focused more like cyber crime ? </s>
Because if we look at that , looking at Heartland Financial Systems and their penetration , you know , there 's similar penetrations like Bradley Manning within the DOD where the DOD had -- </s>
But really , what is your question ? Do you really , truly feel that this is cyber war , like a cyber war threat and that this is n't just cyber crime that happens to be -- </s>
Do you mean is it really -- is it really a nation trying to take down our functioning as opposed to getting into our bank accounts . Yes . Okay . And are those two things necessarily mutually exclusive . </s>
Mike McConnell . It is not cyber war the way you are describing it . But the proposition is threat of cyber war . So we 're talking about the potential threat of cyber war . And what I 'm alleging is when there is conflict , even of a kinetic nature between nation states , cyber will be a part of a warfare that would be carried out . </s>
What my real worry is are terrorists groups that are not deterred , someone who is engaged in the equivalent of suicide bombing , given that they could access , penetrate and cause damage to the United States through cyber means . </s>
So take us back to the proposition . It 's not war is happening . It 's the threat of cyber war being in our future that we must mitigate . Okay , Marc Rotenberg , last word in this section . I just want to restate a point that Bruce made early year , which I think goes directly to your question . </s>
If you have a threat of cyber war , you have to believe that there 's a threat of war . And you have to believe that one country is prepared to destabilize another country , is prepared to see its economy diminish , its trade impacted and whatever diplomatic consequences can follow from that . That 's a really big deal . And in our modern world , it seems increasingly unlikely that countries , even countries that do n't necessarily get along , are willing to take that risk . </s>
So I think this key point about the relationship between the likelihood of cyber war and the likelihood of war ca n't really lose sight of it . Thank you , Marc Rotenberg . And that concludes round two of this intelligence squared debate . </s>
And so here 's where we are . </s>
We are about to hear brief closing statements from each debater . They will be two minutes each . And it 's their last chance to try to change your minds before you vote again on the proposition . </s>
So reminding you of where you all stood when you voted on this proposition , `` The cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated '' at the beginning of the debate . </s>
At the outset , 24 percent of you agreed with the motion . </s>
54 percent disagreed , and 22 percent were undecided . You will be asked to vote once again in just a few minutes , but first ; round three , closing statements . And we 're going to begin arguing against the motion that the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated . Mike McConnell ; executive vice president of Booze Allen Hamilton and former director of national intelligence and retired vice admiral in the U.S. Navy . </s>
Bruce made the statement that the problem is secrecy , to which Marc agreed . </s>
And that 's a very interesting point , but it has nothing to do with this debate . This debate is not about self-serving interests . It 's not about large government programs . It 's not about privacy and civil liberties . </s>
This debate is about recognizing the significant vulnerabilities resulting from our cyber interconnectedness which results in interdependence . The vulnerability is our interdependence . When the framers wrote the Constitution , we were pretty self-sufficient . Most of us were farmers , probably in excess of 80 , 85 percent . </s>
Today in this country , 1 percent of the population is engaged in farming . The 1 percent feed the other 99 percent . There is huge vulnerability in the fact that you are dependent on electric power , digital money , a supermarket full of groceries . All of those things are interdependent and interconnected . </s>
And that 's what we 're talking about , those vulnerabilities . So if there is a war , if there is a war , cyber attack would be mounted . Now , based on the positions I 've occupied inside and outside of government , I can assure you that nation states are preparing for cyber war . Marc said they may be preparing , but they would be unwilling to use it . </s>
You could describe that as deterrence . </s>
I support deterrence . That 's what this debate is all about . What is it we have to do to be able to deter other nation states from engaging in war or engaging in cyber war ? I urge you to support our position on this debate and vote against -- against the proposition . Thank you , Mike McConnell . </s>
Our motion is the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated . And here to offer his summarizing statements for the motion ; Marc Rotenberg , executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center and adjunct professor at Georgetown University Law Center . Okay . So we 've tried to persuade you this evening that this threat of cyber war , key term , has been grossly exaggerated . </s>
And I wanted to say that Mike McConnell and I have debated these issues for many years . And I suspect we will continue to debate them on into the future because we know , on both sides , that there are consequences that flow from how you judge the proposition tonight , whether the military plays a greater role in cyber security , whether internet users are required to identify themselves , whether government agencies are allowed to conduct routine surveillance of communications within the United States . All of those consequences are on the table , depending on what you conclude regarding our debate . But there 's something about the debate tonight which actually surprises me a little bit . And that 's the fact that Jonathan Zittrain is sitting at that table and not our table . </s>
And the reason I make this argument is because Jonathan has written very persuasively about the generativity nature of the open internet . And he has educated us about the value of the decentralized distributed model that has made possible companies like E-bay and Google and services like Wikipedia , and on the story goes . Jonathan , I can promise you that none of this would have ever happened if the NSA had won the clipper chip debate back in the 1990s . </s>
And I 'm going to urge you , along with the rest of you , to come over to our side . </s>
I 'll get a chair for you here . We 've got a couple chairs , do n't we ? We 'd love to have you on our side because if you value an open internet , if you believe that innovation and security , just like innovation and commerce , is based on the open competition of ideas , then you have to support our side . </s>
You have to support the pro position in this debate . </s>
Thank you , Marc Rotenberg . Well , as it happens , summarizing -- up next to summarize his view against the motion , the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated , Jonathan Zittrain , professor at Harvard law school and cofounder of the Berkman Center for Internet and Society . </s>
Marc , let me thank you for your kind and genuine offer of asylum over on your side of the room . Let me tell you why I think instead , both of you guys should be coming over here where the air is clear , and the thinking is equally clear -- -- and where your fears can still be realized over here . You do n't have to give up what you 're afraid of to come over to this side because I was surprised , too , because what surprised me tonight was that if there 's going to be scare mongering on some side you would think it would be on the people saying no , no , the threat is n't exaggerated , here 's why you need to be afraid , be very afraid . But the fear machine I felt was generated over here because what they were talking about were the worries about the remedy , if we come in and take something that they think is n't all that broke and try to fix it we 're going to end up with surveillance we do n't want , with a police state , with a military state , et cetera , et cetera . </s>
Now , in some respects I share that fear of overreaction should we get a watershed event , and that 's why I think we need to be so gimlet-eyed about plausible possibilities that make things different than they are right now . I know the chicken wakes up every day , the free-range chicken , and says , oh , the farmer has come along to feed me again . </s>
Life is good . But sometimes induction does n't work just from the fact that the farmer 's been friendly every day . </s>
So I worry that we 'll get an event of some kind and then Bruce and Marc 's nightmares will come true because we will end up in a Cold War mentality , a conventional war mentality , about how to deal with it , and that is the wrong mentality , and that 's why I stand by my previous writings , Marc , and that 's why when you asked for concrete suggestions they 're suggestions that rely on openness , on transparency , on goodwill and cooperation among people metaphorically passing the microphone from one to another like an ad hoc mesh network . Creatively we can do this . Jonathan Zittrain , your time is up . And I thank you all . Our motion is `` The Cyber War Threat Has Been Grossly Exaggerated , '' and now , making his summary statement summarizing his position for the motion , Bruce Schneier , chief security technology officer of BT and author of `` The Cryptogram '' newsletter and blog , `` Schneier on Security . '' </s>
So we spent a lot of time on semantics here . I 'm going to again read this from the Washington Post , Mike McConnell said , `` The United States is fighting a cyber war today and we are losing . '' This is a position that exaggerates the threat . </s>
It 's a valuable one , $ 300 million in contracts of Booz Allen this year , and -- -- it 's one we see again and again . This is not a few things , cyber war , cyber 9/11 , cyber Pearl Harbor , cyber Katrina , cyber Armageddon -- every one of these words gets to be the millions or 100,000s of hits on Google . This is not just a few headline writers making a big deal . I mean , yes , the word `` war '' has flipped . </s>
We do n't want to use it when we 're actually at war , and we use it all the time when we 're at rhetorical war . And this might seem like a petty semantic argument , but actually this matters a lot . All right , words matter a lot . </s>
Words have power . Words frame debate . Words suggest solutions . And words cause policy to be implemented . We are not just discussing whether the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated , we are discussing how we are going to deal with Internet threats . </s>
This debate has ranged all around . We 've heard about espionage . We 've heard about terrorism . We 've heard about crime . </s>
We 've heard about kids playing politics , and it 's all here on a panel on cyber war . </s>
So when you think about this I urge you to vote that the threat of cyber war has been grossly exaggerated , it 's been grossly exaggerated by government and industry intent on grabbing power and money . </s>
Thank you , Bruce Schneier , and that concludes our closing statements . And it 's now time to learn which side has argued best in the judgment of our live audience . </s>
We are asking you again to go to the keypads at your seat to register your vote on this motion , `` The Cyber War Threat Has Been Grossly Exaggerated . '' If you agree with this motion , if you are with the `` for '' side , press number one , if you disagree , push number two , and if you remain undecided or became undecided , push number three . And we 'll have -- looks like everybody 's done -- we will have the results in just a couple of minutes . </s>
I want to -- first of all , what I really want to do is thank this panel that has been just spectacular , informative , as well as entertaining . </s>
Really . </s>
And I think -- Robert Rozenkranz , I think Washington , D.C. was a good idea , this audience has been terrific and we want you to really applaud yourself , you were very lively , terrific questions , so thank you for that . So I’d like to also thank our venue , the Newseum , and our partners , NPR , WAMU , Bloomberg Television and Newsweek and , of course , a very special thanks go to CEO , Jeff Ganek from tonight’s corporate underwriter , Neustar . Thank you , Jeff , very much for doing this . As was already said a number of times , this is the first time we’ve taken the program outside of New York City and without Neustar’s support , it just wouldn’t have happened so we hope this is not the last time that happens . We’ll be back , Jeff . </s>
Thanks to our moderator . Well , thank you so much . We’re going to be back in New York City beginning our next season on September 14th and the season will kick off with Michael Hayden arguing for the motion which is “Treat terrorists like enemy combatants not criminals.” This fall will also include debates on same-sex marriage , banking reform , atheism and airport profiling . To receive updates and ticket information , make sure to visit the Intelligence Squared U.S. website and sign up for our mailing list and you can also join our Facebook page . </s>
Can we be on those panels ? It’s all booked . You’re on . All of our debates can be heard on more than 220 NPR stations across the nation and you can also watch the debates on Bloomberg’s television network , check Bloomberg.com for air dates and times and don’t forget to read about tonight’s debate in next week’s edition of Newsweek and to pick up a current issue on your way out . </s>
I want to thank all the people who asked the questions . I also want to thank the gentleman whose question I did not take for being gracious in giving up the microphone , and for you up in the balcony for making your presence known and coming down here . So I think I heard a door opening in the back and there’s supposed to be somebody running forward in an excited manner with a piece of paper that I will unfold but Dana , do you have information on how close this is ? </s>
Here she comes now . </s>
If you have to stall I think Mike and I can switch sides for 10 minutes . Yeah . I think that happened already . So we have the final results in . </s>
Our motion is the cyber war threat has been grossly exaggerated . Remember , the team that changes the most minds is our winner . Before the debate , 24 percent were for the motion , 54 percent against , 22 percent undecided . After the debate , 23 percent are for the motion , 71 percent are against and six percent undecided . Against the motion wins . </s>
Congratulations to them . Thank you from me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared U.S . I would just like to invite one more round of applause for our chairman who makes this possible , Robert Rosenkranz . Ladies and gentlemen , welcome to another Intelligence Squared US debate , I’m John Donvan , your host , and I will also be moderating as the debaters you see sharing the stage here with me at the Casparyy Auditorium at the Rockefeller University in New York City . </s>
Two tables , three against three , will be debating this motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” Now , this debate is not a panel discussion or a seminar , it is a contest , a contest of ideas and logic and wit , and perhaps charisma and humor . But most of all persuasion , because by the time this debate concludes , you the audience will have voted twice , both before the debate , and again afterward , your vote is to side with or against our teams on the stage and their position . </s>
At the end of the debate the team that has changed most minds over the course of the debate , will be declared the winner . At this point then let’s do our first vote , you go to the keypads by your side , and I’ll give you about 30 seconds to register your position . </s>
The motion is , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” </s>
Press number 1 if you agree with the motion , number 2 if you disagree , number 3 if you are undecided . Does anyone need more time ? Everyone figured that out , okay . All right , thank you , we’re gon na lock in the votes and we’ll begin the debate . </s>
Now you have already completed the first vote and I will have the results from that first vote shortly . But now , Round 1 , opening statements , uninterrupted , seven minutes , each debater from each side , speaking in alternate turns , beginning with the side for the motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” </s>
Our first debater , Niall Ferguson of Harvard University , he is an economic historian which means he is an explainer . And his most recent book , The Ascent of Money , begins in its early chapters explaining with such eloquence that a third-grader could understand it . </s>
By the end of the book , Niall , you’ve taken on the mess that we’re in now . And I don’t know if anyone really understands that . Niall Ferguson . Well thank you very much indeed , ladies and gentlemen , it’s a great pleasure to be here with you tonight , nothing would be easier , than to blame everything on the bankers . Think of Richard Fuld…of Lehman Brothers . </s>
In 2007 his compensation , for the year , was $ 72 million . The year before his firm collapsed . </s>
Never to be seen again . Or James Cayne of Bear Stearns who made $ 290 million , in the nine years before his firm vanished without trace . </s>
Not only were the bankers greedy , we would agree . They were also , in many cases , incompetent . But I and my colleagues are not here to praise them , or to defend them . </s>
We blame them for much of what has gone wrong . It’s just that we blame the politicians…more . We’ve already heard quoted tonight that wonderful saying of Chuck Prince , as long as the music is playing you have to get up and dance but you have to ask yourselves , ladies and gentlemen , who was playing the music . </s>
You know , it’s so easy , to heap opprobrium on Wall Street right now . </s>
It’s just too easy . And if you noticed , that’s exactly what the politicians do . I couldn’t help but notice , in President Obama’s inaugural address , an allusion to greed , and irresponsibility . And only yesterday , he was denouncing , and I quote , “The recklessness and greed of the bonuses paid to executives at the insurance company AIG.” It was just the same in the last Great Depression , I think of this as the Slight Depression . </s>
FDR in his inaugural address , heaped scorn on the rulers of the exchange and the unscrupulous money-changers . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , you have to ask yourselves…why do the politicians always wax so indignant about finance at times like these ? Could it just possibly be that they’re trying to divert our attention away from Washington’s own responsibility for the debacle ? </s>
What I want to do in the brief time I have available is to invite you to consider the roles played by four institutions , in bringing about this financial crisis , and I also want you to reflect on the location of those institutions . The first is the Federal Reserve Board . </s>
Its role has been to allow a housing bubble to inflate , and burst , between January of 2001 and June of 2003 , the Fed cut its federal funds rate from 6.5 percent to 1 percent . Then over three years it very gradually , by quarter- points , raised rates up to 5.25 percent . In that time , ladies and gentlemen , house price inflation in this country , rose from 7 percent , to 17 percent a year , and it stayed above 15 percent a year , right until January of 2006 . This was the period when Ben Bernanke , chairman of the Fed , proclaimed the advent of a great moderation , in economic life , yes , that was the title of his lecture in 2004 . “Some moderation.” </s>
The location of the Federal Reserve Board , is the Eccles Building , Constitution Avenue , Washington D.C . </s>
The second institution , that I’d like to draw your attention to is the Securities and Exchange Commission , which under Christopher Cox , allowed the leverage in the banking system to spiral out of all control , from some 12 to 1 , to as we’ve already heard this evening somewhere in the region of 20 to 30 to 1 , in the case of the big investment banks . And that was a conscious decision by the SEC . </s>
The location of the SEC , ladies and gentlemen , 100 F Street Northwest , Washington , D.C. My third prime suspect is Congress , ladies and gentlemen . Yes , Congress because it was Congress that wholly failed to supervise Fannie Mae , and Freddie Mac . Those two essential institutions , which underpin the United States mortgage market . On the eve of their destruction , Fannie and Freddie had core capital , as defined by their regulator , of $ 83 billion , and supported around $ 5.2 trillion of debt and guarantees . In other words they were leveraged 65-to-1 . </s>
The location of the Congress , I’m sure you’re aware of this but I can’t help but point it out , is Capitol Hill , Washington D.C . And that brings me to another nearby location—the location of the White House . You know the White House played an extremely important role in creating the sub-prime mortgage disaster . </s>
“We want everybody in America to own their own home , ” declared President George W. Bush , in October in 2002 . Everybody , in America . He challenged lenders to create 5.5 million new minority homeowners , by the end of the decade . </s>
He signed the American Dream Down Payment Act , in 2003 . No Presidential pressure , no sub-prime debacle . The address of the White House , ladies and gentlemen , as you know , 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Northwest , Washington D.C . Well , ladies and gentlemen , bankers are nearly always actuated by greed , so , I’m sad to say , are many ordinary people too . </s>
But it’s the role of government to strike a balance , between market forces , and stability . And I move in conclusion , that we should blame Washington more than Wall Street , for this crisis . </s>
Not least because in my view , Washington sold itself to Wall Street . And I very much fear , is still in hock to it . I beg to propose this motion . </s>
Thank you , Niall Ferguson , arguing for the motion . </s>
Now to argue against the motion , I’d like to introduce Alex Berenson . </s>
Alex Berenson is a reporter for the New York Times who has covered a wide range of stories and issues , he’s been to Iraq , he has been to New Orleans to report on the effects of Hurricane Katrina , but he— Sorry ? Louder ? INTERVIEWER Shall I start again , could you not hear anything ? </s>
Sorry ? The speaker . The speaker , we can’t hear the speaker . </s>
I haven’t said anything yet . Oh— He wasn’t talking yet . But how did that happen ? My mouth was moving . </s>
Alex Berenson is a journalist for the New York Times who has covered the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Iraq , but he’s most known and most relevant in this debate for his investigative work on Wall Street and , Alex , you are a novelist as well , I should point out , I don’t know if you could make up the situation we’re in now . But here’s Alex Berenson to argue against the motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” Thank you , I hope you can all hear me , — I see a lot of green out there tonight , which is fitting on two levels . It’s also St. Patrick’s Day , another festival of wretched excess that will lead to some hangovers tomorrow . </s>
And I have to say I’m at a great disadvantage because , Niall Ferguson has that accent , he could read the phone book to you and it would sound a lot smarter than I do . </s>
But before I get going I want to quickly address something that Niall said— Niall was talking a lot about institutions that were involved with residential home finance . And there’s no doubt that mortgages , residential mortgages are a huge part of this crisis . But the two banks that have collapsed in the last year , the two Wall Street banks that have effectively collapsed in the last year , Lehman and Bear , really weren’t all that involved in the residential mortgage finance business , they— Not to say they weren’t involved but they weren’t as involved as a lot of other people . And the reason I point that out is because , the issues here , are a lot larger than Fannie and Freddie or the home price bubble , as significant as that is . </s>
So let me , let me start by going back to the resolution which , the resolution doesn’t say , we need more regulation going forward , I don’t think anyone on this panel , anyone in this room would disagree with that . And the resolution doesn’t say that bankers should all be put on a desert island and forced to make their own society . You know , I guess that’s the Hamptons but— Sorry , Jim . But— But what the resolution says is , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” And that is flat wrong . </s>
And to understand why , like Niall , I wan na take you back to the Depression , and to the creation of the SEC . Now , the Depression was the last time that there was this kind of public anger at Wall Street and at big business in the United States , and understandably so . And when the Roosevelt administration created the SEC , one of the things that they considered doing , briefly , was having the SEC have the power to prevent companies from selling shares , not because they were committing fraud or misrepresenting their financial statements , but simply because the SEC’s economic experts would find , well , this company doesn’t have very good prospects . This company has too much competition . We’re not gon na let them sell shares . </s>
And that idea didn’t go very far , it was very rapidly rejected , but it was considered . But what—why I think this is so important and interesting is it shows that even during the Depression , even during a time when unemployment was 25 percent and there were breadlines and there was really a question about whether capitalism could work , and there—you know , there was an alternative model that seemed to be working in the Soviet Union— Even then the United States went with a relatively permissive , regulatory regime . And that’s always been our history . And to me , that makes sense , and if you think about your own life , if you think about your own business as you know , whether you’re a lawyer or a doctor or whether you work in retail , whether you—a landlord , whatever it is that you may do , you probably have a better idea where the opportunities are , but also where the problems are , where you can take advantage of your customers , where you can cut corners , than any regulator could no matter closely they monitored you . It’s your business , it’s your life . </s>
And so the regulator needs to set the rules , but in the end—you succeed or fail on your own . </s>
And think about the commercial airline industry in the United States , which is really a great success story in the most important way which is that it’s extremely safe . </s>
You can count the number of jet crashes this decade on one hand , in the United States . And , you know , we’re going towards zero . And I don’t think that’s because the FAA is a better regulator than the FDA or the SEC , or anyone else , I think it’s because there’s a commitment in the airline industry to safety . </s>
Now whether they define that as a moral issue , we need to protect our passengers and our workers , or whether it’s a practical issue where they believe there might not be economic repercussions , people might not wan na fly if there were too many crashes , I don’t know . </s>
But there’s no question that the airline industry in the United States is extremely safe . </s>
And I think it’s not a result of the FAA , I think it’s a result of a commitment within the industry . </s>
Compare that to Wall Street , which appears to have been run by a bunch of greedy children , for the last 10 years . </s>
And greed is a crucial word there , because although Niall sort of—you know , he mentioned the compensation and then skated past it . Compensation is a crucial , crucial part of understanding what went wrong on Wall Street in the last 10 years . When you can make a million or 10 million or in some cases $ 100 million for a year’s work , you don’t have very much incentive to run your business for the long term . If you can…if theoretically , you’re being paid in stock , and your compensation is gon na be restricted over a long time , you have more incentive . But even so if the numbers are really , really large , it’s unlikely that you’re going to think long-term . </s>
And so I think Jim now will talk to you about some of the specifics of what went wrong on Wall Street in the last 10 years . But , at its core , the issue is relatively simple , there was a huge amount of leverage taken , there was inadequate capital to support the risks that the banks were taking . When you make loans , some of them are gon na go bad , and you need to have enough money in capital , in equity , to handle those losses , and the banks simply didn’t have that . Now , did Washington create the conditions that allowed that to happen , sure . </s>
Could we and should we have had a much more robust regulatory system ? </s>
Absolutely . Regulation is vital , regulation sets the playing field , it sets the rules . </s>
But in the end , you have to put blame where blame is due . And , blame is due on the firms . It’s due on the owners , it’s due on the managers , it’s due on the executives , it’s due on the employees . To some extent , although to a lesser extent it’s due on shareholders because the shareholders didn’t properly manage the boards of directors but that’s something Nell can talk about . But in the end , blame accrues to Wall Street , not Washington , please keep that in mind , and vote against this resolution . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Alex Berenson , speaking against the motion , Now to speak for the motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , ” I’d like to introduce John Gordon Steele , a man who’s a little bit difficult to pin down , he is an adventurer , he has spent time in politics , he’s been a filmmaker , he has been an NPR commentator and still is , but it’s as an author of books focusing on critical periods in financial history that he comes to us today with expertise to argue for the motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” Ladies and gentlemen , John Gordon Steele . </s>
I’m sorry… I’m gon na correct that , ladies and gentlemen , John Steele Gordon . </s>
The British always wan na file me under Steele-Gordon , with a hyphen . I only use my middle name because John Gordon is about as blah a name as you can find . I’m here to argue that Washington is more at fault than Wall Street , although as everybody has admitted , Wall Street has plenty of blame to take here . But…Wall Street is not unitary . </s>
Wall Street is nothing but a metonym for the American financial market , and it operates around the globe and…nowadays , deep down into the socioeconomic spectrum . Now some of the people who are encompassed by the term “Wall Street” have fiduciary obligations to their stockholders or to their depositors . But the majority of , of Wall Streeters do not . </s>
They are operating entirely for themselves in their self-interest . Washington on the other hand , has nothing but fiduciaries , I mean that’s why governments are instituted among men , no other reason . Now , Wall Street because it is entirely inhabited by people who are pursuing their self-interest , it’s notorious that there are only two emotions to be found on Wall Street , fear and greed . </s>
Right now I think it’s perhaps time to put in a good word for greed . As a result , we have had panics on Wall Street roughly every 20 years . Now the Constitution came into effect in April of 1789 , we had the first crash on Wall Street in April of 1792 . </s>
Then we had another one 1819 , 1837 , 1857 , 1873 , 1893 , 1907 , 1929 , 1987 , and now 2008 . It seems to be just part of the beast , I mean could any of these panics have been prevented by Wall Street ? </s>
I doubt it . Being individuals , and Wall Street is nothing but a collection of individuals , not an institution , it is inherently susceptible to the madness of crowds . So , blaming Wall Street is like blaming the atmosphere for thunderstorms , it’s the nature of the beast , it’s going to happen . </s>
Washington on the other hand is supposed to be the guys with the striped shirts and the whistles on the playing field . They make up the rules , and then they enforce them . </s>
And then they sometimes change the rules in order to accommodate some of their friends . Also Alan Greenspan famously said , that it is—part of the Federal Reserve’s job is to take away the punchbowl when the party really gets going . In other words it’s Washington’s job to prevent the crowd from going mad . They’ve just done an incredibly lousy job of regulating Wall Street or preventing the madness of crowds . </s>
I mean for one thing the regulatory apparatus is a total shambles . I mean we have the Federal Reserve , we have the Controller of the Currency , we have the SEC , we have the Office of Thrift Supervision . We have the FDIC . We have the banking regulatory authorities of the 50 states . All of them bureaucracies , all of them devoted as all bureaucrats are to protecting turf , far and head of , of actually regulating anything . </s>
Now , also , politicians are subject to human nature , the same as Wall Streets are . If Wall Streeters are in the business of making money , politicians are in the reelection business . That means that they’re gon na be short term-oriented , they’re gon na —what they want is the good headline tomorrow morning , and if that produces dreadful policy two or three or five years out , that’s after the election , we’ll worry about it then . </s>
Everybody knows that publicly-traded corporations have to submit annual reports , that these reports have to be according to standardized accounting rules , and that they have to be certified as being honest and complete by independent accountants . This is a great idea . It’s now so obvious that nobody even thinks about it anymore , but it was invented by Wall Street . Because the great Wall Street banks in the late 19th century , they wanted to know what the corporations were really up to , and so did the members of the New York Stock Exchange . </s>
So the corporation screamed bloody murder at first , but the Wall Street banks said sorry , if you want us to underwrite your securities , you’re gon na have to do this , and the New York Stock Exchange says if you want your securities listed with us , you’re gon na have to do it , so they finally did it . There’s still one great big player in the financial world in the United States , that is not subject to these commonsense rules . It’s called the government . For instance , you remember those budget surpluses in the later years of the Clinton administration between 1998 and 2001 ? </s>
They amounted to $ 558 billion . So the national debt went down by $ 558 billion , right ? Uh , no , it went up by $ 400 billion . The reason is that Social Security was put on budget . </s>
And that means that the revenues that flow into Social Security over and above what is paid out to recipients of Social Security becomes part of the government revenue , it’s called an intra-governmental transfer . Of course the money that’s taken out of the Social Security trust fund is replaced with newly minted federal bonds . </s>
Which is why the debt went up . Now , if a private company or publicly-traded company , tried to take employee contributions to the company pension fund , and call it revenue in order to perk up the bottom line , the managers of that corporation would all this very minute be playing volleyball in Club Fed . </s>
Or , consider Fannie and Freddie . It was a great—Fannie was a great idea , it sounded , in 1938 -- and it really , it liquefied the mortgage market , it helped , along with the GI Bill tremendously , to increase home ownership , and I’m gon na have to quit here I’m afraid . </s>
I have to interrupt you . Thank you very much . </s>
But for the introduction I’d like to—I’d like to give you the shot at being applauded twice because , for the radio broadcast since I made the error on your name I’d like to reintroduce you and have everybody applaud for you again , and you can enjoy that . Ladies and gentlemen , let’s welcome John Steele Gordon . I’m really sorry for that , let’s look at where we are . </s>
We are halfway through our opening remarks , I’m your moderator , John Donvan , we are hearing from two teams of three debaters each , arguing this motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” We are now going to hear from the next debater against the motion . Jim Chanos is the founder and managing partner of Kynikos Associates . </s>
He has had a successful period let us say because , he is a man who bets against the market . Recently a very successful period , I don’t know , Jim , in this situation , are congratulations in order— But , I welcome you to our debate , ladies and gentlemen , Jim Chanos . </s>
Thank you , John , and thank you to Robert and to Intelligence Squared for putting on this great series and heightening the public debate on these important issues . I think you’re doing great , great work , thank you . Now , we’ve heard from two-thirds of the “for” team’s members , and from my august teammate , Mr. Berenson . </s>
And , we all seem to be missing sight of the resolution . Again , no one seems to disagree that more regulation is needed . No one seems to disagree , that crimes , malfeasance , and incompetence , were at work . </s>
The question is who’s more to blame . And I hope to be able to make my point , that in fact that’s gon na be pretty easy to point out . Before I got here I was searching the web for instances of Irish wit when it comes to financial markets and money . Now my mother was Mary Catherine Sullivan , and as much as I— I tried hard to find examples of that wit , I came a cropper . </s>
So I had to turn to another great philosopher , in all matters economic . Tony Soprano . Who went imploring his gang to work harder , ‘cause not enough money was coming in to keep everybody happy , said “Look , we don’t got one of them Enron things here.” </s>
This is important . Because , I would like to go on to tell you that agency risk as it exists in corporate America is legion . It is endemic , and it is pervasive . In 1998 Business Week put out a survey , after , canvassing 500 of the S & P 500 Chief Financial Officers anonymously . </s>
And they were asked in the celebrated question , “How many of you have ever been asked by your superior to materially falsify financial results.” And the answer was stunning . 45 percent said they were asked to do so but didn’t , 12 percent said they were asked to do , and did , and 33 percent said they were never asked . So at the time , 10 years ago , two thirds of our nation’s largest CFO’s had basically been asked to cook the books . And luckily , only a minority did so . </s>
And lest you think this was an outlier , the same survey roughly , was repeated by CFO magazine six months later , and had very , very similar results . It’s the main reason I have a business that I feel will continue to prosper no matter what the markets do . Because quite frankly out there , there’s a lotta people in the public markets that wan na take your money . </s>
And that , ladies and gentleman , is a point I think that we are going to carry tonight . </s>
How did we get , in the last five years , when things seemed to escalate so much , so much worse on the fraud side , from Enron , Tyco and rogue analysts , to the world of Bear Sterns , Lehman Brothers , AIG , Bernie Madoff , and Stanford Financial . Well…I think the reason we have , is that those in charge , yes , they may have fallen asleep . Yes , they may have done dereliction of duty . </s>
But we saw a level of compensation , and a new structure of structured finance that allowed , as Alex pointed out , undreamed-of amounts of leverage , and skewed incentives for compensation . It was heads I win , tails , my shareholders lose . </s>
Every trading desk had a mantra of making their numbers in one way , shape , form or another , and did so quite easily in all kinds of markets in the last five to 10 years , up , down , whatever . </s>
It was not just Madoff who produced stunning consistent and profitable results . If you look at the profits as Bob Rosenkranz alluded to in his opening statement , of our largest banks and brokers , no matter what the markets did , many of these firms returned 20 to 30 percent on equity , quarter in , quarter out , with very little variability of operations . How did that happen . Well , they were gaming the system . </s>
Remember Sarbanes-Oxley ? I do , I got all kinds of phone calls from the press after Sarbanes-Oxley saying well you don’t have a job anymore . Short selling will never be profitable . </s>
Yes , corporate malfeasance will be a thing of the past . Because CEO’s and CFO’s now have to sign the financial statements . And if something goes wrong , they could go to jail . And when I pointed out to those same journalists that falsifying financial statements has always been a crime , and this just simply codified it a little tighter . </s>
Well , this is post- Enron , people are going to be vigilant , and accountants and lawyers will not let this happen . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , I will pose to you that there has not been one major financial fraud in the past 25 years , uncovered by the government , outside auditors , or outside counsel . It’s always been journalists , whistle-blowers , or short sellers , or some combination thereof . Daresay , that if Bernie Madoff had been public , the shorts would’ve found him out a long time ago . </s>
Now , post- Sarbanes-Oxley , post-Enron , we had to move to tougher accounting standards . We saw FAZ 46 get brought in , and I’m not gon na bog you down in arcane but it basically said , keeping things off the balance sheet is no longer kosher . Part of the problem with Enron as you recall were the funds that were offshore that an Enron CFO was general partner of while he was still undertaking his duties as Enron CFO . </s>
Well , guess who lobbied for a big exemption , of those rules . The banks and brokers , who got FIN 46-R enacted which was , financial institutions were exempt , from the consolidation of offshore entities and unconsolidated entities , hiding large amounts of assets and liabilities . Imagine that . And while we’re at it let’s talk about Professor Ferguson’s locus of problems . Well the Fed , yeah , the Fed’s located in Washington , there’s no doubt about that . </s>
But the part of the Fed that is instructed to be the market cop , is the New York Fed . Now the New York Fed for the past few years was run by the current Treasury secretary . </s>
But do you know who sits on the board of the New York Fed and do you know who it answers to . </s>
Bet very few of you do . The largest commercial banks in the United States . Jim Chanos , I have to cut you off , your time is up . </s>
Thank you very much , ladies and gentlemen , Jim Chanos . </s>
Now to argue for the motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , ” I’d like to introduce Nouriel Roubini…known , I think we all know , as Dr. Doom . </s>
Having predicted much of what has happened a few years back , having a name like that only really works out if you turn out to be correct . So far so good , Dr. Doom , ladies and gentlemen , Nouriel Roubini . </s>
Thank you , ladies and gentlemen . I say the beginning I support the proposition , I blame more Washington , than Wall Street for this financial crisis , but I should say the beginning , that I do agree that Wall Streeters , bankers , traders , investors , are greedy . Sometimes they are stupid , they are arrogant , they’re incompetent . </s>
They take too much risk , they take too much leverage , they are over compensated , all that’s true . But we’ve had the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression , we have to ask ourselves , are bankers and investors more greedy and more immoral than they were 20 years ago . </s>
20 years ago , Gordon Gekko in Wall Street said that greed is good . </s>
I don’t think that has changed , you know , we know there is always greed , actually greed in some sense is good , is one of the drivers of capitalism . </s>
But we know that greed has to be controlled by three things . By fear of losses , by the fact they should not expect to be bailed out , and by a system of prudential regulation and supervision of the financial system because financial markets without ruling institutions are like the law of the jungle . And that’s to me the failure , I expect Wall Street to be greedy but I expect good policy-making , trying to control the behavior , and that did not happen . In many dimensions . The Fed and Greenspan , after the last tech bubble went bust , cut interest rates almost to zero , and created the asset bubble , kept interest rates too low for too long . </s>
Was most at that time , people talked about the Greenspan put in financial markets , it was the expectation whenever trouble occurs , Greenspan’s gon na ease things and get you out of your losses and problems . It happened after the 1987 stock market crash and the S & L crisis easing , then in the ‘90s with the tech bubble , Greenspan warned about irrational exuberance and did nothing about it . And after the tech bubble went bust , he cut interest rates from 6.5 down to 1 percent , and he created the latest bubble . So , he has been a creator of serial bubbles one after the other and when people expect to be bailed out then they behave accordingly , that’s the Greenspan truth . </s>
We created a system which people expect , that the gains are going to be privatized , and the losses are going to be socialized ; this is a welfare state for the rich , for the well-connected and for Wall Street . That’s what happened , that’s public policy . The action of the Fed regarding the asset bubble , was , you don’t do anything on the way up , that was the official rule of Greenspan , Don Kohn , and Ben Bernanke , and when the asset bubble collapses , to avoid the collateral damage to the real economy , you ease aggressively . </s>
Again , that’s a buyer’s behavior that creates more and more bubbles . We’re running out of bubbles actually to create , with the real estate bubble , the tech bubble , the hedge fund bubble , the private equity bubble , you know , even the commodity bubble , the art bubble , we’re running out of bubbles to create but we’re easing again down to zero so , what’s gon na happen this time around . As was pointed out , the job of the Fed is to take away the punchbowl when the party gets going but unfortunately not only the Fed did not take away the punchbowl , it added vodka , whiskey , gin , and every toxic stuff to it . And it made the bubble even bigger . </s>
Take the role of the Fed and the regulators , with sub-prime mortgages…Greenspan was the biggest cheerleader of this kind of financial innovation . Zero down payment , no verification of income , assets and jobs , they called them ninja loans or liar loans . Interest-only mortgages , negative amortization , teaser rates , all this toxic stuff or sub- prime , near-prime , prime . The Fed and Greenspan actively said was the best thing that have happened to mortgages . </s>
Free market , they could control it , they had the law , the power to do it , they didn’t do it . Think about our public policy towards housing and mortgages . The Community Reinvestment Act , creation of Fannie and Freddie-subsidized housing . The 20 ways in which we have subsidized , through tax policy , interested community of mortgages . The worst , and the most unproductive form of investment , investment in housing . </s>
Big McMansion can give you utility but doesn’t increase the stock of capital in the real way of productivity of capital and labor , like , physical capital does . We have subsidized housing in 20 different ways . That has led to the bubble as well . </s>
There was an ideology for the last decade in Washington , that was critical to this financial crisis . </s>
Was an ideology of laissez-faire , Wild West unregulated capitalists . The base of this ideology was the idea that banks and financial institutions will self-regulate . And as we know , self-regulation means no regulation . It was the ideology of relying on market discipline , and we know when there is irrational exuberance , there is zero market discipline . There was an ideology , and policies of relying on an internal risk- management model and as was pointed out , Chuck Prince said , when the music is playing you got ta stand up and dance , nobody listens in good times to the risk managers , they’re the party poopers , only the risk takers have the advantage in the banks , and therefore , relying on internal risk management doesn’t work . </s>
Was relying on rating agencies that had massive conflicts of interest because of being paid by those they are supposed to be rating . And this rating agency had a quasi-governmental role . They had monopoly or oligopoly power , and power to decide whose assets you can buy or not buy , that was policy that led them to have that power , and those kind of distortions . </s>
So every element of our regulatory system , has failed , you know , this Basel accord that relied on this principle , has failed even before it was implemented . Relying on principle rather than rules , relying on light touch , rather than tough rules , a light touch means no touch at all . </s>
The ideology of Greenspan was , every financial innovation is great , markets self-regulate . Shareholders are gon na be able to control the behavior of bankers and so on . This was the belief in deregulation . Elements of it , actions were taken . </s>
The repeal of Glass-Steagall that separated investment banking from commercial banking . Now we let them essentially , use deposit insurance and deposits to do 30 times leverage prop trading , that’s what was allowed . Essentially deregulation of credit derivatives and derivatives , over the counter with systemic risk . Things of that sort were going on . </s>
The SEC deciding the level ratios , 30 to 1 was okay . </s>
Those were the policy that led then to those excesses . There is greed , it is up to public policy to make sure that greed is controlled because otherwise if you don’t have rules , institutions , and balance and prudential regulation supervision , is the law of the jungle , and unfortunately the last element of it was regulatory capture . It was an ideology in which , the government power taken over and controlled by lobbies where those were pushing for this kind of deregulation . </s>
So it was a massive failure of public policy , thank you . </s>
Thank you , Nouriel Roubini . Finally to speak against the motion , Nell Minow who is an attorney who has held positions in various government agencies but she’s best known and again most relevant in this debate , for having run a firm which held corporate CEO’s to strict accountability , she was described by Fortune magazine as “the CEO killer.” </s>
And I know we have some CEO’s in the room , Nell , so this is not literal , is it . Ladies and gentlemen , Nell Minow . Only when they deserve it . </s>
You’ve got to vote for our side . </s>
I have to tell you , you know , there’s plenty of blame to go around , we all agree , there’s plenty of blame to go around . </s>
You know , there’s Washington , there’s Wall Street , but all of us know who really is to blame here , it’s got ta be Jim Cramer . Listen , I’m willing to blame everybody , I’m even willing to blame that Bachelor guy , I— everybody , everybody deserves— it takes a village to create this problem . </s>
Or put it another way I’m gon na quote Pogo , who said , “We have met the enemy and he is us , ” every one of us bears some responsibility for what went on here but I’m gon na tell you today , why it’s Wall Street that is primarily responsible . First of all , it’s a bit of a false distinction , between Wall Street and Washington . And one of the things I’m going to talk about today is how inextricably they are linked . </s>
We talk about Fannie and Freddie . Those were public corporations , after all . They were a little bit the better , the worst of both worlds , a little bit of a duck billed platypus because they had a little government edge there . </s>
But those were public corporations with Boards of Directors and they behaved like public corporations . They behaved badly . And that is what is wrong with Wall Street . So you may noticed already , even in this few minutes that I’ve been up here , I’m different . I’m not like anybody else on this panel and that is why , and the primary difference , as I’m sure you’ve noticed , is I’m the only one on the panel who is from Washington . </s>
I have to say , none of these people know anything about Washington except some addresses . That’s all we know . I see he’s got a GPS , is all he’s got . And you know , and the other thing is , I’m not an economist . I am a capitalist . </s>
I , uniquely on this panel , I have created businesses . </s>
I have created businesses , had them grow and sold them . </s>
I have worried about making a payroll . So I know something . I’m not like an economist who , it works in theory , it doesn’t work in practice . So I know what it is to be a capitalist . </s>
And I know what it is to be a bureaucrat . I worked in the government . </s>
In the Reagan administration I was at OMB . And let me tell you , one of the big shocks in my life was all these people who espouse and rhapsodize about the free market kept trooping over to me to get me to give them limits on liability and erect barriers to entry . Everybody is all about the free market except when it benefits them not to be . So I’m going to tell you the three things that Wall Street did that are unforgivable and that really weigh the balance in favor of their responsibility . What is the one thing we want from Wall Street ? </s>
We want just one thing . We want them to be able to do math , right ? The math was wrong . </s>
Their math was bad . They put too much reliance on something called the Gaussian copula formula . </s>
Yes , the Gaussian copula formula is at the heart of what created the derivative securities , the credit default swaps . They all relied on it . </s>
They all got on one leaky little boat . They didn’t take out their slide rules . </s>
They didn’t do the math . So they relied on bad statistics . They left out one big variable . </s>
Yes , they heard music , but what dance were they doing ? They heard music for the minuet . They were doing the boogie , okay ? And what is the address of all of those forms ? </s>
I believe it’s on Wall Street . Second thing , bad incentives . They were getting paid based on the quantity of transactions , not the quality of transactions . Now , it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that’s going to have a very bad result . Look at what we’ve seen about the pay just in the last couple of days . </s>
Look at The New York Post with its headline today : AIG Is a P-I-G . </s>
These people were getting paid regardless of what happened . You heard about Anthony Mozilo ? Six hundred million dollars as he took the stock down seventy-eight per cent and took the economy down with it . Fuld didn’t have to give any of it back . </s>
I testified with Fuld before Congress in Washington when they called him in to account . </s>
And he said , up until last year the performance was pretty good . So he should be allowed to keep all that money . Only thirteen percent of companies on Wall Street have claw backs , meaning they have to give back the money when the numbers that were reported , that they got their bonuses on , turn out to be wrong . That is on Wall Street . What are they doing now ? </s>
Watch them carefully . </s>
They are repricing their options . </s>
That is disgusting . </s>
And that is Wall Street . Okay , next . </s>
Terrible oversight as shareholders . Yes , the shareholders should have done more . Guess who the big shareholders are ? Yeah , they’re on Wall Street . </s>
Who was it that was voting in favor of these insane pay packages ? Well , look at the firms on Wall Street . They’re the big shareholders . </s>
They’re managing all that money . They are enablers for the addiction of bad pay packages on Wall Street . </s>
And yeah , Washington behaved badly . </s>
Washington behaved very badly . </s>
Do you think the fact that from 1998 to 2008 over six hundred million dollars was spent on lobbying to get rid of regulations , like Glass-Steagall , to get rid of capital requirements on banks – do you think maybe that might have had an effect on it ? Yeah , Washington is nice to its friends . Who is responsible for that ? Who are its friends ? </s>
I would like Wall Street to make the same disclaimer that is required of mutual funds . Past performance is no guarantee of future performance . And who is it that requires them to say that ? </s>
That is Washington . Wall Street has expected us to bet on them for a long time . </s>
They have not lived up to our trust in them and they are more responsible than Washington for this mess . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Nell . You know , and that concludes round one , opening remarks of this debate . We had you vote when you came in , vote on whether you side with the motion , against the motion or are undecided . And we have the first results from that first vote . </s>
Restating the motion : Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , forty-two percent of you vote for this motion , thirty percent vote against and twenty-eight percent remain undecided . We’ll poll you again at the end of the evening and the team that moves most votes , the team that changes most minds will be declared our winner . So we’re now going to move on to round two and in round two the debaters talk to each other directly and they also take questions from us . So on to round two . And I just want to ask Niall Ferguson , since your side is arguing that Wall Street should be blamed for the economic crisis and we heard your ca ... I’m sorry , Washington should be blamed for the economic crisis . </s>
And we heard your teammates say that Washington did not do its job well . My question really is , if Washington had performed its job well , would we have an economic crisis ? Well , I think one way of answering that question is to ask whether every country in the world is having a financial crisis comparable to the one that’s being experienced in the United States . Now , most countries in the world are experiencing an economic crisis , largely as a consequence of what is happening here . </s>
But they’re not all experiencing a financial crisis . </s>
You don’t have to travel terribly far , actually , to get to a country where banks are and have been adequately regulated . </s>
That country is called Canada . So if you simply look at what’s happened there it becomes obvious that something was egregiously wrong with the regulatory environment in the United States . And that is our central point . It’s not difficult to see that there was a grotesque failure on the part of regulators and politicians here . </s>
You only have to look north of the border . Nell Minow , you’re on the opposite side of the , of the argument but I see you nodding . Well ... That’s always a good sign . </s>
You know , the fact is that the banks are supposed to be able to respond to whatever is provided for them in some kind of a rational way . </s>
And they didn’t do . As I said , they all relied too heavily on the same set of numbers . But I’m not sure that I think that more regulation is the answer . </s>
Is that what you’re arguing for ? </s>
On the contrary . I’ve never said I’m in favor of more regulation , simply better regulation . </s>
Well , in what way is it better ? Can I conclude my point ? If you think back to the highly regulated financial markets of the 1970s , it’s not as if that was a period without financial crisis . I’m old enough to remember stagflation and the secondary banking crisis in the U.K. and the problems of that period were in many ways as serious . Certainly the recession of the early 1970s was as serious as anything we’ve experienced so far , though I don’t rule out that this is going to get worse . </s>
So , no , I’m not in favor of more regulation . The heavy regulations that were imposed during and after the Great Depression didn’t actually prove to be that benign . The trouble is that the deregulation , much of which was justifiable , was taken to excess . This , I think , is the point that John Steele Gordon , Nouriel Roubini and I want to stress . </s>
And it’s not difficult , if one compares different regulatory frameworks around the world , to see why the U.S. was so bad . But don’t you think the fact , the point that I made about six hundred million dollars being poured into Washington , they don’t have that system in Canada , either , for lobbying and for political campaign fundraising . But you understate the case . </s>
Nouriel Roubini , let’s let Nouriel Roubini come in and respond . I think there is a strong correlation that goes to history between degree of proper regulation and financial crisis . </s>
You know , after the Great Depression we imposed a system of strong regulations of the financial system , capital controls and for a few decades there were not that many financial crises and banking crises . It’s not just the U.S . If you look around , for the last twenty years , you have had financial crises and banking crises and so on in a number of countries . </s>
And what has been changing over the last twenty years , starting with Ronald Reagan and then Margaret Thatcher , the ideology became of deregulation at any cost , first in advanced economies and then in emerging markets . </s>
Now , some deregulation was good . Nobody is in favor of excess . Even probably we swang the balance too much in the direction of too much regulation after the Great Depression and that led to not enough financial innovation . But deregulation without a proper institution and so on has been known to lead to financial crises , like in East Asia , like in Mexico , like in Argentina and so on . </s>
And therefore , there is a strong correlation between the quality of the regulatory and supervisory regime and whether financial crisis occurs . There’s a trade off between the two , but that’s what’s really the fact that now in spite of the great moderation , low inflation and growth , these financial crises are occurring now more frequently . These should occur once every thousand years . </s>
Now occur every other year – more frequently , more virulent and more costly in every way . Alex Berenson , from the other side . Certainly there has been a huge amount of deregulation in the last twenty years . </s>
There’s also been major changes in the structure of Wall Street . Firms , you know , Wall Street was essentially a set of partnerships , largely , until the Seventies and by the Nineties , I think , Goldman was the last big firm to give up the partnership model . </s>
So , again , it’s not your capital at risk anymore . It’s your shareholders’ capital at risk . You don’t own your firm anymore , you own a portion of it . </s>
I don’t think it’s an accident that there are some small partnerships out there that have essentially thri -- Well , thrive may be too strong a word . But they have survived this crisis . The other very , very important change , really the most important change , is the egregious increase in compensation . It’s one thing if you’re making five hundred thousand dollars a year . </s>
Let’s say you’re making some multiple of an average American’s salary , where if you do that for ten years , you’re , you know , you’re very well off . It’s another thing if one good year makes your life and makes your children’s lives . It really skews your incentives . John Steele Gordon . I just want to point out that Nell has said that Wall Street spent six hundred million dollars lobbying Washington for regulations that Wall Street liked . </s>
I’m sure that’s perfectly true . On the other hand , Washington took the money and produced the regulation . </s>
Nell ? </s>
You know what ? Washington has its own market system . And , people have got to get re-elected . That’s what accountability is . </s>
Yeah , they took the money . </s>
But , you know , you’re blaming the victim there . Nell , do you want to respond to the audience response ? Yeah , sure . If , look , if -- MAN The victims are the people who pay taxes here . </s>
If you want to , if you want to make this about campaign finance reform , I’d be happy to turn this into that debate and I’d be happy to come back and have that debate . I’m totally in favor of that . But the United States is the only country in the world that has this level of corruption coming into politics from money because this is the only country in the world that doesn’t free television time and forces politicians to buy the time . </s>
So you want to take money out of politics , I think that would be a great thing . I think it would be hugely beneficial in Washington , believe me . But you can not blame , you can not blame Washington for the fact that all this money comes in from Wall Street . . </s>
You know , Washington might be corrupt but you have to think about the international dimension of this phenomenon . There are many countries with totally different laws about lobbying and so on and there have been about fifty banking crises in the last twenty years and have occurred in very different political regimes . And if there is something in common among all of them , it’s that in most of these cases you had a controlled financial system and then deregulation occurred too fast and in ways that did not provide prudent regulations provision of the financial system . As I said , you know , capitalism is based on greed . </s>
Greed is just about incentive , about maximizing returns . We’re all greedy , you know . </s>
First of all , you said you are the only one from Washington . I spent two years at the White House in Treasury and also ran a successful business . </s>
So I know about policy . I also know about business . I tell you , in my business I’m greedy and I react to incentives but I want public policy to be setting rules and regulations so that I don’t misbehave and I don’t cheat and I don’t lie – Please , let me bring , – </s>
... and I don’t take excessive risks with taxpayers’ money because— Niall , Niall Ferguson . </s>
Your teammate , Niall . Nell , I’m still struggling to understand how the recipients of bribes are victims . I’m sorry . I have to tell you , you’re , I’m afraid your moral GPS just broke down on you there . </s>
Let me just say , let me just say that this is abso -- </s>
It is not a ... and in fact , if you look at the lobbying statistics you’ll see that half of the people that took the money voted against them anyway , which is part of politics , too . But the point is , as you well know , people ran ... Well , hang on . </s>
People ran for office and were elected on policies of deregulation . And – Hang on one moment . Okay . </s>
You’ve hit the nail on the head here . AIG , P-I-G , AIG spent 9.7 million dollars on federal lobbying last year , in one year . And that was down on the previous year . It’s contributed directly to candidates , to elected officials and parties , 9.3 million dollars since 1989 . It would have been much more but for campaign finance limits . </s>
And the top recipients of the money include the Chair of the Senate Finance Committee and the Chair of the Senate Banking Committee . </s>
Now , if that doesn’t tell you that something is morally rotten at the heart of Washington , I don’t know what we have to show you . If it doesn’t tell you that something is -- Jim , Jim , I want to – Jim Chanos , you contrarian you have been sitting there silently on the side against the motion . Well , just because the Keystone Kops couldn’t catch the gang that couldn’t shoot straight , doesn’t absolve that gang from its guilt . In -- in not only looting the system with material intent but materially abrogating their fiduciary responsibility to their clients and the nation . </s>
I want to , look , I want to bring the audience , you the audience into it at this point . And it’ll take us about twenty-five seconds to get a sense of how many hands are up and we’ll come to you with microphones . But we would love to bring you into this conversation now and by your responses already you are a terrific , a terrific audience . So where is a , let’s bring one down to the center , to the gentleman in the blue tie . </s>
I have a question for Mr. Ferguson . I believe you said that you don’t believe in more regulation , only in smarter regulation . But eliminating lobbying is that part of smarter regulation and if so , do you know a constitutional way to do it ? Well , the regulation that seems to be more important than that , actually , has to do with bank capital adequacy . </s>
I don’t think one can simply say that this financial crisis is a result of lobbying . That would be a stretch . </s>
This crisis is much more to do with excessive leverage . And if one simply regulates bank capital adequacy better , moves away from the self-regulation of Basel I and Basel II , I think many of the problems will be resolved . </s>
I’ve written on this -- Can I finish now ? I mean , I know you’re eager to have at me and I always welcome interruptions . I just want to remind you that the victims in the crime that we’re discussing here are the taxpayers and voters of the United States who are now on the hoop for , what ? , nine trillion dollars ? Now , I’ve written actually on the subject -- MAN </s>
... of campaign finance reform . </s>
And it seems to me extremely problematic . You know , it’s been cited , I don’t know where you got this evidence from , Nell , that most other countries in the world don’t have this problem . This is completely untrue . </s>
The problem of corruption is endemic in most countries and the United States is very far from being the worst . People talk about the BRICS – Brazil , Russia , India , China – all vastly more corrupt than the United States . The exceptions are a tiny number of countries in Europe , which for cultural reasons , seem not to suffer from chronic corruption . Those countries do not suffer from chronic corruption – not because of regulation . </s>
There are many , many regulations that restricts lobbying and campaign finance in Europe . And in some European countries they work and in others they don’t at all and they’re simply circumvented . So don’t delude yourself . You can’t simply fix the problem of financial crises by eliminating political finance . You don’t mean , are you saying that there was no lobbying involved in reducing the capital requirements ? </s>
There was tremendous lobbying involved . </s>
I’d like to see Alex Berenson , who has been patient , now . No , I think what we all would agree on is that in a very real way , Wall Street has set the conditions of its own regulation in the last fifteen years . </s>
And clearly , that has gone too far . And Washington , I mean , to me , seems to work best when there are two strong sides debating an issue . When it came to deregulating the banks there really wasn’t anybody saying , Don’t do it . I mean , there were a few people who didn’t have any money . But the commercial banks wanted it and the investment banks went along with it and nobody really disagreed . </s>
So when you have a condition where the industry is essentially creating its own regulation , that’s no regulation . And then it falls even more on the people , the executives , the managers in that industry to act like adults , which they did not do . Niall Ferguson . One , one question’s for you , Alex . </s>
You represent the fourth estate here , the press . What , where was the press when these things were being done ? I don’t remember extensive coverage of the relaxation of bank capital adequacy rules in 2004 in The New York Times . </s>
But perhaps I missed that Krugman column . Let’s go back to some questions and I just want to point out the last question was a perfect example of a question . Let’s follow that model toward the top . A gentleman who caught my eye , and that’s you reaching for the microphone . Yes , thank you . </s>
To go quickly from euphemisms , Washington being one , Wall Street being another – and to just not single out poor old Bernie Madoff as being the villain of the moment , can we have from the panel some of the names of the human beings who were me ... behind the mechanisms that created this problem -- such people as likely as Chuck Schumer , Barney Frank , Chris Dodd and others of that ilk . I mean on the—you can also name Stan O’Neal and Chuck Prince , and Frank Raines , and Dick Fuld , I mean , you know , you can name the guys who took home , collectively , billions of dollars in the last five years . John Steele Gordon just because you haven’t spoke in a while , would you like an in on this ? Frank Raines of course was a Washingtonian to his fingertips . And— </s>
He’s the CEO of a public corporation . A public corporation that had unique tax advantages , and had an implicit government guarantee , even though legally there was no guarantee but it was implicit , and of course when they did collapse , the government came up and bailed them out . Which is why they were able to borrow money at below-market rates , I mean so it was a—you know , Fannie and Freddie were economic chimeras created in Washington by the government , for purposes of making the government books look better . And then they ended up with this beast . </s>
Question from the far top . </s>
Um…there , in the impetus for what happened , there’s been a lotta talk about greed , on the side of the… folks arguing for the resolution , um , as an excuse . I’d like to hear you address the question though of incompetence . There— You said incompetence— ? </s>
Incompetence . A lot of these companies , they didn’t just take risks , they weren’t just greedy , the leadership was incompetent , they ran their companies into the ground . </s>
They’re bankrupt . And also because of the risk to the rest of the country and the world economy , taxpayers have bailed them out . What about this question of incompetence . </s>
Thank you . </s>
To which side are you addressing your question— Oh , the—for the motion . </s>
For the motion . </s>
Wait— </s>
Nouriel— —I would not , you know , we know there are these issues in corporate governance because in any corporation , the shareholders can not control the actions of the managers , there is information the manager might want to maximize the rents and that leads to distortions , you know , the manager might short of compensation and benefits , at the expense of the shareholders , but again , you know , Alan Greenspan , and he—when he made his testimony , he made the admission , he said—he admitted that one big mistake he thought that he made was that he thought the shareholders of companies could control the behavior of bankers and managers and because of that he didn’t think it was necessary to further regulate this financial institution . For 30 years of corporate finance literature , that talk about these agents’ problem between principle and agents when there is information . It’s well-known for Chicago , to MIT , to anywhere else . And he was clueless about it , how could he be clueless . </s>
If he’d known about it , there were regulation that could have minimized those distortions of compensation , of information , of taking excessive risk through leverage , controls through more liquidity , to reducing certain type of incentive . </s>
They were clueless about it . Nell Minow , do I see you again agreeing with your opponents ? I think , listen , as I said there’s a lotta blame to go around , there’s a lot of incompetence to go around but when Paul Volcker says that he does not understand the derivative securities it seems to me we should have a Paul Volcker rule that if Paul Volcker does not understand it you should not be able to sell it . And a question from the center . And in 2000 we decided to completely deregulate any credit derivatives . </s>
They should be over the counter , not on exchange , no settlement rules , no clearing rules , no counterpart rules , nothing . That was a mistake of policy , there were people in policy , the CFDC were against it and SEC , the Fed , everybody else said no . </s>
Should be a free market not regulated and that led to the disaster— But— —of credit derivatives— </s>
But Dr. Doom— </s>
Alex Berenson— —wouldn’t that have—wouldn’t that have just driven— —policy procedure , we could have put them on an exchange— But if we had done that , wouldn’t the firms have just traded those overseas . </s>
No , because , that’s why you have international rules and we have rules about avoiding— </s>
So it’s— —that jurisdictional , you do— So it’s now Brussels— —we do— </s>
—is the problem ? Huh ? It’s now Brussels that we’re debating— Listen , capital , we have international rules , there is a agreement , there has to be coordination of international regulatory policy , ‘cause otherwise things are gon na go offshore . </s>
But instead of cracking down on offshore centers , we’re stimulating them , that was again a mistake of policy— </s>
Jim Chanos . </s>
Well , actually after LTCM in 1998 , Jerry Corrigan and others were charged with the effect of looking at credit derivatives , and basically went to the industry , who went down the self-regulatory route for clearing and other mechanisms . So again we have a case of Washington going to the industry and the industry doing what it could , to drag its feet or skirt—skirt what was probably good policy all along . Okay , we are halfway through the head-to-head par—round of the debate . The motion is “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , ” I’m your moderator , John Donvan , and we are now going to the center for a question . </s>
That’s for the against-the-motion side…it seems that incentives is like one of the main issues here . Compensation’s been crazy , and incentive—incentive’s misplaced , it’s been all over the place , how do you change that , if not by better regulation , how do you change human nature , which is basically like , they’ve been bending the rules , they’ve been swinging , as Roubini mentioned , he’s gon na be greedy in his business , I would be greedy in my business , I would do whatever it takes to maximize my profits and that’s what they’ve been doing , if it’s not about better regulation how do you , how do you really like , how do you change it ? Are you—are you literally asking how do you change human nature ? </s>
No , no— I—that seems to be— In a way you are— —how to change the incentive— And I think maybe it’s a rel—quite relevant question— </s>
How to change , how do you change like how people are , the models and how people are doing— I see heads being put together on this one . Aside from— Alex Berenson— Aside from alcohol I don’t know— No…I , no , I think that’s a really good question . </s>
As I said at the very beginning of my statement , that is not the question we’re debating , tonight . We’re debating whether or not these firms should have behaved better , under the regime that they had . That said , I do think—I mean I think that what Niall says about increasing capital requirements is at the core , it’s a very , very good idea . </s>
I can imagine , and I don’t know whether this could work in reality , there’d have to be some very , very smart people to figure out if it could work— Sort of a dual system where there’s one group of very , very heavily regulated , essentially postal banks , that have , that have explicit government guarantees of insurance , that offer sort of plain vanilla products , that are , you know , essentially national , quasi-national institutions . And then there’s another group where , anything goes . </s>
And you can make or lose whatever you want , you can pay your employees whatever you want , but if you go under , you are not getting one dime and that is the explicit charter that you’re operating under . And the difficulty is figuring out how those two systems would interface . But if you could do that , then , hopefully we could avoid this problem in the future . </s>
John Steele Gordon . </s>
I don’t know about human nature , I don’t—you can’t change it . I mean that’s virtually by definition . But I think it was Frances Bacon who said that to rule nature you must first obey it . And what we have to do is simply understand human nature and take it into account when we set up our rules . </s>
One thing about compensation , is that it’s been very fashionable in the United States for years now to have the CEO also be the chairman of the board . Which makes him his own boss . </s>
And whenever you are your own boss , you are going to overpay yourself . They—yeah , the CEO stuffs the board with people who are dependent upon him , other high-level management , I mean it seems to me that a corporation , unless you have enough stock to justify a seat on the board , if you work for that corporation you shouldn’t sit on the board . Nouriel . </s>
There is a regulatory capture in almost every industry , the lobbyists take over the regulators and change things into their own interest . But there’s only one industry , the financial industry , in which this thing leads , over and over again , to financial crisis , banking crisis . They’re a disaster , they cost trillions of dollars . </s>
And ask yourself what happens , and why that happens . </s>
It happens for two reasons . One because banks have deposit insurance and deposit guarantees . Should we take some of the asset people money , you leverage like crazy , do crazy things . If you gain it’s your money , otherwise it’s the taxpayer . </s>
Two , we have lender of last resort support . </s>
When banks get in trouble the Fed comes to the rescue , and it’s a variant of this moral hazard of the bailout . </s>
And that’s why these banking crises occur over and over and over again , and they’re becoming more disrupting , more expensive and so on . </s>
That has to do key , with exactly our regulatory system , there is something wrong about it and if we don’t fix it these things are gon na happen , and the costs are gon na come even bigger , again , people are greedy in every industry , people in every industry try to avoid regulation sometimes with lies , sometimes by cheating or avoiding , whatever . That’s human nature , why it leads to disaster in financial industry , because we have the system . Sir , you have , you have the microphone in your hand , go ahead , please . Thank you . </s>
This is addressed to both groups . So it seems to me to reflect on which group deserves more blame , we have to make some assumptions and I think the participants are making assumptions , about what is behavior that’s reasonable to expect from one group or another group . And then the one—the group that departs further from those reasonable expectations , gets more of the blame . </s>
But I don’t think everybody agrees on what can reasonably be expected from each of the groups . </s>
So , it’s assumed that , by some people , that you can reasonably expect greedy behavior , uh , from , uh , Wall Street types or from the people in that business , but not that it’s reasonable for Congress people in the political game to try to do things to keep—this is Nell Minow’s point of course— Niall Ferguson who’s— So— </s>
—arguing for the motion— </s>
—so how do you decide which are the reasonable expectations from the different groups , and won’t that tilt very strongly what blame you assign . </s>
Niall Ferguson— This isn’t— This isn’t rocket science . One set of people under discussion , owes a duty to the public interest . Those are the politicians and regulators . That is why we call them public servants . </s>
And the other group , let us take the investment bankers , because of course , Wall Street is composed of many different institutions , but let’s take the investment bankers . They owe a duty , to their shareholders , and also to bondholders . Now it’s quite interesting though the point hasn’t been made yet , that to all of these investment banks performed equally badly . The fate of Bear Sterns and Lehman Brothers illustrates that egregious bad management can achieve . But the performance of Goldman Sachs was really significantly different . </s>
Goldman actually didn’t lose substantial amounts of money , though its shareholders have certainly taken some punishment . And the punishment has been meted out by the market , to the people who invested in those banks . They will almost certainly end up with nothing , I’m fairly clear , that those people who invested in financial securities will end up with very little indeed . And I think that’s particularly true in the case of the big commercial banks . </s>
But , Niall— And can—can I finish— —that is exactly the point— </s>
—‘cause this is a really important point , Bank of America , and and of course Citigroup . But the interests of the public are to be defended by people in Washington . </s>
That is the big difference between these two groups , and that is absolutely clear , that we have to lay the blame on Washington . The failure of Bear Stearns , was a disaster from the point of view of people who invested in it . But it became a disaster for the entire US economy , and indeed the world economy , because of failures of regulation . And those seem to me to lie very squarely in Washington D.C . </s>
A question from the— I think you’ve just proven the point— —woman in the center , please— —that not every bank , failed , not every bank behaved equally badly— This is Alex Berenson speaking . </s>
Go ahead , Alex . Not every bank is as responsible as every other bank for this crisis , Goldman is gon na get by a—you know , Goldman’s gon na get along fine , there are gon na be commercial banks that get along fine . It helps that AIG has been bailed out of course— Well , that’s true , that’s true— </s>
—let’s not lose sight of that . But— </s>
The twist in the tale . But wouldn’t you agree that that shows that there were distinctions made on the street ? </s>
Ma’am , I encourage you to break in to this exchange— Okay— —with your question . </s>
I—I know that given all the discussion about greed at financial institutions many of us would assume that there were many good people at these companies who were simply afraid to say something about what they saw . And my question is for anyone on the panel , can you envision a way to effectively institutionalize a financial company employee’s ability to report irregularities or essentially poor practices— </s>
I think there’s a— — in ways that couldn’t be , that , that you can’t , simply avoid— I’m not really sure I agree with that , I mean there were not whistle-blowers jumping up and calling the New York Times to tell us about things , and even Enron , and Jim knows , you know , Jim certainly knows more about Enron than anybody— The whistle-blowers really were a— </s>
Yeah , very , very late in the game— Also Sarbanes-Oxley gives huge , huge protections to whistle- blowers and incentives to whistle-blowers . So I really don’t think that’s the problem . </s>
Ma’am , you can follow up . </s>
Take the microphone to follow up just so we hear you . That’s a very risky thing to do to be a whistle-blower to the New York Times , if there are—there could be other ways in which confidentiality for employees is protected . </s>
And there is under Sarbanes-Oxley . Okay , but not…okay , but , there probably are still— Okay , I—I—I— —better ways to do it— —I can’t let you get into the debate but thank you for the point , I wan na go to the young man in the front row , please . </s>
I have a question for Mr. Chanos ? You said earlier that , the government has never uncovered corruption , uh , I believe for the past 20 years which is it’s all done by journalists , and short firms . But does it—would that mean that Washington is at fault and granted , these companies shouldn’t have been corrupted in the first place . But… wouldn’t—if they’re given the opportunity , wouldn’t it make sense they would , they would abuse , wouldn’t it be foolish to assume that they wouldn’t abuse this power that they have ? </s>
Question mark , thank you . That’s a good question . Well…let’s just look at the response of this crisis . In following , immediately following what Bear—the demise of Bear Sterns , you had the CEO’s of our major banks and brokerage troop down to Washington . What are the two things they requested , from Washington , following this stunning collapse almost out of the blue of one of our major brokerage firms . </s>
Was it tightened regulatory surveillance , was it more regulators on the trading desk , was it something like that , no . They asked for two things . </s>
They asked for short selling to be stopped , or curtailed , and they asked for a loosening in the accounting rules . And on both cases , one was done , and changed , the other’s under consideration now . </s>
So rather than tightening up things and making things more transparent , and giving incentives to market forces like short sellers , to ferret out fraud , and malfeasance , what has Wall Street done ? </s>
It’s come running to Washington to ask for more help , and more obfuscation and more opacity . And that’s about as telling as you get . </s>
Does the side for the motion wan na respond to that ? </s>
John Steele Gordon . Washington could say no . All right , short and sweet . </s>
Gentleman at the top ? </s>
Both sides acknowledged I think that one of the major questions here is who’s more to blame . So I wan na try to make it , maybe philosophical , and go back to the Keystone Kop examples , my question’s for against the motion . So let’s take the Keystone Kops , couldn’t catch the gang , doesn’t make the gang less culpable . Obviously everyone’s gon na agree . But given that the job of the Keystone Kops in the first place , given the job they’ve taken on , is to keep order , if they’re asleep or corrupt , maybe drunk , aren’t they therefore even more wrong than the people who in the first place committed the action who had no responsibility , fiduciary duty , whatever you wan na call it , who had no responsibility beyond what they’ve signed to but whom— are not nearly in the same position… </s>
Thank you— —of authority . </s>
Thank you . Nell ? Well , the idea of the SEC when it was created in the 1930s , was that it would be about putting information into the market and letting the market sort everything out , the SEC , his authority is very limited , so they’re a Keystone Kop without a billy club . And , it’s a good idea to consider that , again , and it’s a good idea to consider rewrapping some of that unwrapped regulation that we talked about , but right now Washington doesn’t have the tools , and doesn’t have the authority necessary , I think , to provide that kind of oversight . And your opponent , Nouriel Roubini ? </s>
Well , you know , I go back again to the issue of incentives on international scales , financial crises do not occur everywhere , there are countries like Canada and many others that have better regulators and supervised financial system , and these things don’t occur . It’s not that Canadians are more moral or less greedy or less incompetent or more competent or more arrogant than anybody else and , same thing for Europeans and Asians and you name it . Human nature is similar . And by the way they are not crooks , you know , everybody responded to incentives , everybody wanted to maximize profit returns and whatever , that’s what market economies are all about , but we know that human behavior can lead to excesses in society , that’s why we have institution in society , otherwise the law of the jungle . And in this case of financial market you know that greed and excesses can lead to damaging effects , that’s why prudential regulation , supervision of financial institution , is so much more important so at the end of the day , it’s good public policy , it makes a difference between crisis occurring or not occurring , that’s the lesson of the last 50 years , it’s not about human nature , or greed or being criminal— </s>
We have time for one more question . This is for , against the motion , it seems like this is a , uh , chicken , which came first , chicken or the egg . Do you mind if I tell the panel that actually both sides can address your question , we’ll be— </s>
Sure , absolutely— — the motion , but please , everyone consider this your final question— It may be so appropriately chicken versus the egg , chicken being Washington , being afraid to do what’s right , and Wall Street who’s laid a ginormous egg . If it is a chicken- versus-egg scenario , and , as Mr. Gordon pointed out that we have a history of financial crises every 20 years for the most part , uh , wouldn’t it seem to be that Wall Street since our country was founded first and foremost by entrepreneurs and businessmen , uh , that set out to form their own government , that it would actually be driven more so by Wall Street than the government that they formed ? </s>
Alex Berenson . I think , just to address that and to address the previous question ‘cause I think the previous question is a very good one , do you blame the cops or do you blame the robbers , if it—you know , the robbers are gon na steal isn’t it the cops’ job to stop them . I think you can take the Keystone Kops analogy too far . We want to have a banking system that makes loans . </s>
We want credit to be available to people , you know , the invention of the credit card , is actually one of the great inventions in American soc—you know , in the world in the 20th century , it really is , it’s the democratization of credit , where you didn’t have to go in and get down on one knee before a banker , to get a loan , was meaningful to people . </s>
Being able to get a house and a mortgage is meaningful to people . </s>
So what we don’t want—so , you know , they’re robbers , but they’re not robbers , they’re people serving a useful societal function . And it’s up to… So— So that makes— I know , I know , I can’t believe I just said that either . I think Niall Ferguson is trying to get in here— But wait , let me just quickly fin— </s>
As your attorney I would advise you to stop speaking immediately— Let me just quickly finish . Quickly finish . </s>
That makes the job— —bad guys , I’m getting there . </s>
That— So , that means that the regulators , are not strictly out to arrest them or bust them , we have to set up a somewhat permissive regulatory system to allow them to operate , and then hope-slash-insist , that they actually don’t run the system into the ground , which , we didn’t do that— Can we do chickens and eggs now , because I’m getting bored of cops and robbers . The— Far be it from me to lecture an audience like this about American history but it seems to me that , the question wasn’t really framed quite correctly . From— I think you’re handling it okay , actually— </s>
That—thanks . The—from the very inception of the United States there was a profound tension , between Washington and New York . </s>
Alexander Hamilton’s vision of the United States as a financial power was not shared by all the founding fathers and indeed James Madison was extremely skeptical about it . That’s why there was consistent resistance to the creation of a central bank in the United States , that lasted right up until 1913 with the Bank of the United States being chartered and then gotten rid of twice , in the course of the 19th century , so— I think we need to see this as part of a long argument , within American political culture . How powerful should New York be . </s>
And should those other parts of the United States , let’s call it Main Street , should they in fact dominate . And I think what’s happened in the last 10 years , is that New York did get the upper hand . And I think the rest of the country , is ready for a backlash . Ladies and gentlemen , that concludes Round 2 of our debate . </s>
So we are in the final stretch , in a very short time you the audience will decide who is the winner . Recall that at the start of the debate we asked you whether you agreed or disagreed with the motion before us , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , ” before the debate , 42 percent of you were for the motion , 30 percent against , and 28 percent undecided , we will now have summarizing comments by each side of two minutes each . And I wan na ask you at the very end , I will make an announcement of the winner , and at that point I would ask for your forbearance , give us 30 seconds to end the NPR broadcast , it oh so pleasant to have the sound of applause . And I will at a certain point raise my hand , I would ask you to applaud and then I’ll bring it down and everyone can go home . So just— It’ll be this . </s>
That’s clear ? We’re not gon na do the rehearsal , it’s not kindergarten , you know— okay . Round 3 , summarizing comments from each side , first summarizing…against the motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , ” Alex Berenson , investigative reporter for the New York Times . I wan na thank Niall , for sort of making our point with his very last remark where he said that New York became more powerful than the rest of the country . </s>
I do think that to some extent all six of us forgot something when we were presented with this question that only came out in the debate in the discussion in the last 20 minutes , and that is , the internationalization of the— of the financial system . </s>
That when in 2000 the banks said to Washington , if we don’t want these regulations on credit derivatives , what they also said was , if you force this on us , we are going to go elsewhere . And , you know , it was only a few months ago that we were hearing that London was gon na be the primary financial center in the world , followed possibly by Shanghai and Hong Kong within about five to 10 years , now , I think the city in London is getting even more badly hurt right now than New York . But the point is , actually that Washington-versus-Wall Street is a false dichotomy because the banks became so powerful within the sphere of the financial world , that they essentially told Washington , if you try to regulate us strictly , you are going to lose our business , jobs are gon na go overseas , and there will be no regulation at all . So you can have the SEC , and the Fed , and weak regulation , or you can have no regulation , those are the choices that you face . </s>
And they meant it . </s>
There were jobs shifted to London , a lot of jobs shifted to London , jobs shifted to Hong Kong . And I think that when you forget that , it becomes easier to blame Washington , if you remember that , you will vote against this resolution , you will put the blame where it belongs , on Wall Street . Thank you . Summing up for the motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , ” John Steele Gordon , author of An Empire of Wealth . </s>
Well , I just wan na say that while Wall Street certainly needs reform , it always needs reforms and it’s constantly being reformed , it has been for 200 years . But it doesn’t need reform as badly as Washington , specifically Congress . Which is a profoundly sick institution . </s>
Institutions tend to evolve in ways that benefit their elites , and if you want the poster child for that , it is the United States Congress . I also wan na just add one thing on the… People on the other side have been saying that Wall Street took all this—took their checkbooks down to Washington and lobbied to get the regulation they wanted rather than stricter regulation . And actually said , therefore , Congressmen were the victims of this . I’m sorry , but Wall Street was not debauching a virgin , it was paying a harlot . Thank you very much . </s>
Thank you , John Steele Gordon . </s>
Summarizing against the motion , Jim Chanos , founder of short- selling investment firm , Kynikos Associates . Boy , how do I follow that one . Well , again , we’ve had a lot of lofty philosophical questions batted back and forth , but there have been very , very few facts put forth tonight . And I wan na stay with the facts . </s>
So we’ll just consider one instance , Lehman Brothers . Which when it failed , had adequate regulatory capital , and was still profitable in its trailing 12 quarters . Yet when the credit default swaps were settled for Lehman Brothers , a month later , its debts were marked down 90 cents on the dollar . </s>
Now its debts at the time in terms of funded debt were $ 150 billion , stay with me on this , numbers are important when it comes to Wall Street . So , 90 cents off on that dollar bill means the debt was impaired by $ 135 billion . </s>
Lehman bonds still trade around 10 to 15 cents on the dollar , six months later . There’s $ 20 billion in equity at the time , that tells us that the hole in Lehman’s balance sheet was roughly $ 150 to $ 160 billion . To put that in perspective the hole in Enron when the dust cleared , roughly was $ 60 to $ 70 billion . Lehman was twice as bad as Enron . </s>
We haven’t gotten to AIG yet , or Bear Stearns , or God knows what else . Ladies and gentlemen , malfeasance trumps incompetence for the purpose of this resolution , and I urge you to remember that when you vote . Thank you , Jim Chanos , Kynikos Associates . Nouriel Roubini , Professor of Economics and International Business at New York University’s Stern School of Business will summarize for the motion . Well , you know , it’s not a debate about robbers and cops because there is a huge amount of evidence that actually , financial development is very beneficial for economic activity . </s>
Companies are more financially developed , provide lots of services , you know . </s>
Credit cards , mortgages , commercial real estates , insurance , risk hedging , you name it , it’s very important and beneficial but we know that when there is financial innovation sometimes becomes excessive , there is asset bubble , there are credit bubble , excessive restaking . People become greedy and all the rest , and you can have a system that is so regulated like some countries , like India , whenever there’s a bank that is ever failing , but you won’t actually , the market economy where sometimes , some banks fail . But you don’t want a system which everybody’s collapsing , you have systemic risk . And the distinction there is you want innovation , like in any country because it’s gon na be beneficial , but you want to avoid crisis , and to avoid crisis , you need appropriate rules , institution , prudential regulation of the financial system . Not too much , not too little , it’s a trade-off , it’s not a black-and-white . </s>
And the difference between a system that works , that has innovation and provides benefits , and avoids a crisis and one which crisis occur over and over again , has nothing to do with Wall Street or the greedy bank as you name it . Has to do with the quality of public policy . Proper supervision and regulation . </s>
That’s the distinction , has been always the case across countries , across history , so let’s look at the big picture . Thank you , Nouriel Roubini . The motion is “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , ” and summarizing her position against the motion , Nell Minow , editor and co-founder of The Corporate Library . Politicians are accountable through the political system , you don’t like ‘em , don’t vote for them . You wan na vote for candidates who don’t take money from lobbyists , be my guest , that was a policy that got Barack Obama in part elected . </s>
That’s great . But the people who stole money , to send it to Washington , are the people on Wall Street . </s>
Is there one shareholder of Bear Stearns or Lehman , who wanted that money to be used to weaken regulation ? No it wasn’t , there’s a huge moral hazard involved there . </s>
The same moral hazard that involved them paying themselves hundreds of millions of dollars . The return on investment for CEO pay is less than a piggy bank . And that’s because they’ve corrupted the system . They didn’t need any help from Washington for that . </s>
They did it themselves . So please , vote against the resolution . Thank you , Nell Minow , and finally , summarizing for the motion , Niall Ferguson , Professor of History at Harvard . </s>
Well ladies and gentlemen , it’s not very often that you hear Washington D.C. defended , by a journalist , a former government attorney , and a short seller . </s>
The journalist told us it would all have been absolutely fine if the banks had been as run as—had been run as well as the airlines , when did you last fly Continental , Alex ? Jim Chanos told us that corporate fraud is endemic in corporate America , and this goes from Enron to Madoff . What they agree about , and here they do agree with us , is that , in many ways , Washington is in hock to Wall Street . </s>
The difference is that Nell Minow thinks that Washington , the legislators , poor things , are the victims , in this strange case . Now , that is where we part company . On our side we see them anything as the victims , we see them as the key perpetrators . </s>
And let us not forget just how far this has gone . Who was , Nell , the second biggest recipient of donations from Fannie and Freddie ? Yes , it was the President of the United States , Barack Obama . </s>
And let’s not forget that among the firms that contributed most generously to his campaign were Goldman Sachs , Citigroup , J.P. Morgan , UBS , and Morgan Stanley . What we need to contemplate , ladies and gentlemen , is the Latin Americanization of the American political system . This symbiotic and indeed corrupt relationship between Wall Street and Washington is the thing that is rotten at the heart of the United States , it is the principal explanation for this crisis , and that brings me to the key question you have to ask yourselves . Who has to defend the public interest . Is it the investment bankers , the hedge fund managers , or is it your elected representatives . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , it is perfectly clear , that it is Washington that has failed to defend the public interest , and I fear , it is continuing to fail to do so . Please do vote for the motion . Thank you , Niall Ferguson , and that concludes the argumentation portion of the evening , it is now time for the moment of truth , in which you the audience pick the winner . </s>
Now you voted earlier when you came in , on the motion which is “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis.” We’re asking you to vote a second time . Does anyone need any further instruction in the voting process , everyone understands . </s>
Right . All right , we’re gon na lock the keypads , and the results are being tabulated , we’re about…55 seconds away from knowing the outcome of this debate and while we are waiting , I think you are going to wan na hear this… Next month’s topic…is rather salty . First I wan na thank the audience and the panelists for a terrific evening and you were actually a spectacularly good audience with great questions , and a great sense of presence . Our next debate will be Tuesday , April 21st , the motion is , “It is Wrong to Pay for Sex.” Panelists for the motion are Melissa Farley , a psychologist for Prostitution Research and Education , Catharine MacKinnon , a professor at the University of Michigan Law School , Wendy Shalit , author of A Return to Modesty . </s>
Panelists against the motion are Sidney Biddle Barrows , better known as the Mayflower Madame , Tyler Cowen , a Professor of Economics at George Mason University , and Lionel Tiger , professor of Anthropology at Rutgers University , this debate will take place here at Rockefeller University’s Caspary Auditorium . And all of our debates can be heard on more than 170 NPR stations across the country . Please check your local NPR member station listings for the dates , and the times of the broadcasts and finally , copies of books by our panelists , as well as past DVD’s , are on sale in the lobby and I read some of these books in preparation for this debate , and they are well worth picking up and taking a look at . So you have heard the arguments , you have voted twice now— Our winner will be determined by the team that changed most minds . To remind you , when you came in…42 percent of you sided with the motion , “Blame Washington More Than Wall Street for the Financial Crisis , ” 30 percent of you were against the motion , 28 percent of you were undecided , and now the results of the final vote , 60 percent of you are for the motion , 31 percent against… 9 percent undecided , the side for the motion wins… congratulations to them , I’m John Donvan… thank you to Intelligence Squared US . </s>
Thank you . Thank you . And I just want to point out that this is the final chapter , the final debate of the 4th series of Intelligence Squared U.S. which was founded by Robert Rosenkranz who made all this possible and on this occasion , the conclusion of the fourth season , a round of applause . </s>
Welcome to another debate from Intelligence Squared U.S . I 'm John Donvan of ABC news and , once again , I have the pleasure of serving as moderator as the four debaters as you see sharing the stage with me here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts at New York University . Two against two . We 'll be debating this motion : “Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline.” Now , this is a debate . It 's a contest . </s>
It will have winners and losers , you , in our audience , and you 're one of our largest . This is a sellout for this debate . You will be serving as our judges . By the time the debate has concluded , you will have been asked twice , both once before and once afterwards to vote on this motion where you stand . Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline . </s>
At the end of the debate , the team that has changed most minds over the course of the argument will be declared our winner . So let 's go to the preliminary vote . There is a key pad to the right of your seating position . If you agree with our motion , “Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline , ” if you 're with the for team press Number One . </s>
If you 're against the motion , press Number Two , and if you are undecided at this point , press Number Three . And if you feel that you 've made an error , just correct it and the system will lock in the last of your votes . And I 'll have the reports of that fairly shortly . </s>
We 're going to have opening statements first , and after that I 'll be able to report the preliminary results . </s>
So on to the debate . </s>
Round one , opening statements by each debater in turn , they are seven minutes each . I would like to begin by introducing our first debater for the motion , Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline . Dan Senor , I first met when he was serving as spokesman for the coalition for provisional authority in Iraq . He has a lifelong and keen interest in foreign policy . </s>
In that case he put his money where his mouth was . </s>
It was not a safe assignment at all . He has also recently been named as a putative candidate for senate from New York State , but you have shelved that for the time being ? I have . I hope you wo n't hold it against me . </s>
No . If you 're interested in foreign policy , it worked out for Hillary Clinton . </s>
I will take that as a quasi endorsement ? Dan Senor . Thanks , John . </s>
Thank you , John . And thank you , Bob , for hosting this . </s>
It 's an honor to be here with Bernard-Henri Lévy and General Clark and Mort Zuckerman . </s>
One caveat before I make my presentation . I 'm not here tonight to issue a sweeping critique of every decision of President Obama 's foreign policy . In fact , there are some that I have been quite supportive of , quite publicly supportive of . I thought it was incredibly courageous of President Obama to take on his own political base and commit to doubling down our troops in Afghanistan . Effectively under his presence , he will have doubled our troop levels . </s>
Maintain the commitment , the agreement in Iraq between Prime Minister Maliki and President Bush , and our presence there despite having campaigned against it , vigorously during the 2008 presidential campaign . Nor will I issue a sweeping defense of the foreign policy decisions of President Obama 's predecessor . </s>
There were some decisions that President Bush made that I was very supportive of , and some that I have been critical of . </s>
What I 'm here to do tonight is try to focus this question along with my friend Mort here who comes at this issue , by the way , from different perspectives . He was a supporter of -- public supporter of President Obama . I was not . </s>
But we both have deep concerns about America 's power in world affairs today : America 's status in world affairs today . And whenever there has been a prospect of American decline as we think there is today , the -- one of the shock absorbers , if you will , to prevent that decline or at least slow it down , has been an enlightened understanding among Americans about America 's role in the world , about American power . </s>
And the secret is not so -- not so secretive secret , is it 's not just about American power , sort of an enlightened understanding of American power . It 's about America 's part of a liberal international order , about America as a builder of a Democratic world order . And you have seen these principles articulated , the notion that America helps to turn adversaries , whether there are autocratic regimes , totalitarian regimes , help them transition to democracies . You 've seen this throughout American history . It 's a bipartisan post World War II at least , bipartisan foreign policy commitment dating back to Truman and Acheson after World War II where they articulated certain principles . </s>
America will stand by Democratic allies around the world no matter what . America will stand by dissidents fighting for their freedom in human rights around the world no matter what . </s>
America will consult with its allies before it panders to its adversaries no matter what . And America will have a defense budget and military budget , not only to defend its own borders but to back up those principles and stand by its friends . And that is what I 'm concerned about . Because you are seeing a realignment in American foreign policy today that backs away from those principles . </s>
Those principles are not Republican principles , they 're not Democratic principles . As I said , you can look at Harry Truman , you can look at John F. Kennedy , America will bear any burden , pay any price to back up those principles . President Clinton , who under General Clark 's superb leadership in the Balkans intervened to stop genocide in the heart of central Europe , in the spirit of human rights , in the spirit of helping out allies . And put American prestige on the line , by the way , not only American lives and resources but American prestige because he did it without U.N. support . President Clinton enlarged NATO , was willing to bring central and eastern European powers into NATO , and not let Russia 's ambition for hegemony in the region hold those countries hostage . </s>
This is the spirit you 've seen throughout our foreign policy transcending party lines have been exceptions , obviously , the Carter years , part of the Kissinger years , and today . Today it 's more than just a flare-up . Today it 's a realignment in U.S. foreign policy . You are seeing a strategic decision by this administration to basically send a message to our friends and allies around the world that they ca n't count on us for very good reason -- the administration would argue , because we 're in an effort to reach out to new quote unquote friends . </s>
We 're trying to turn over adversaries . In so doing , we may have to compromise our historic friendships . Look at the -- this is just not an abstract discussion . </s>
You just look at where we are in the world today . Iran is closer to having a nuclear bomb today than it was a year ago . This is n't hyperbole , this is a fact . Despite pleadings from our friends and allies in moderate Sunni regimes in the Arab world and leaders in Israel . </s>
This is a fact . Leaders in eastern and central Europe were completely off guard when President Obama announced a unilateral revoking of our missile defense agreement in the Czech Republic in Poland just a few months ago , all in an effort to reach out to Medvedev and Putin in Russia . Lech Walesa who personifies the appreciation and gratitude that millions of people around the world feel for America standing by the principles I spoke about earlier , said after Obama announced that decision after his administration announced that decision , he said this just shows you , you ca n't count on the Americans . </s>
Lech Walesa . Nicholas Sarkozy , the president of France , has called the president 's foreign policy naive . And in the U.K. where they talk about the symbol of a special relationship , the U.S. has had a unique relationship with the U.K. going back to Churchill and FDR , and certainly in the past 30 years that special relationship between Reagan and Thatcher , President George W. Bush and Thatcher , President George W. Bush and John Major , Clinton and Tony Blair , and President George W. Bush and Tony Blair . And yet an open discussion in London , the special relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. is in jeopardy . </s>
Gordon Brown , former Prime Minister Gordon Brown , had made five requests , five requests to have a one on one meeting with President Obama and could n't get them to answer the phone . He wanted to meet at the UN , he wanted to meet at the G 20 . Enormously embarrassing to the Brits . And Secretary Clinton , when she was in Argentina in March , she called on the British to reopen negotiations with Argentina over the Falklands , a wound that was in the process of healing 30 years ago and she ripped that scab off . A country -- to do this to the U.K. , a country that has shed so much blood in its alliance with America and today has 10,000 troops in Afghanistan serving with us . </s>
So I would simply say that American alliances are in major jeopardy around the world . I think the message has been clear over the last 15 or 16 months that it’s a darn good time to be an adversary of America and it’s a pretty crummy time to be a friend and historic ally of America . And the moment our historic alliances and friendships believe that that they can not count on America and its fidelity to the principles of Truman and Acheson , America truly will be in decline . Thank you , Dan Senor . Our motion is Obama’s foreign policy spells America’s decline and speaking first against the motion , Wesley Clark . </s>
You just heard him complimented by his opponent for his service leading NATO forces in the operations in Bosnia . He’s the former NATO Supreme Allied Commander , Europe . </s>
Again , a lifelong public servant who made a very credible run for President in 2004 , actually winning primaries along the way . Although General , it occurs to me that had you won , these guys might be blaming you for America’s decline right now , so maybe it worked out . Ladies and gentlemen , Wesley Clark . </s>
John , thanks for that introduction . I’d like to be up here debating my own foreign policy , but that isn’t the debate . But this is a very , very important issue . And I’m very honored to be here with Dan and with Mort and with Bernard . </s>
And thank you very much for moderating and thanks to all of you for being here . And for those of you who did support and donate to my presidential campaign , I thank you for that too . </s>
I was very concerned about American foreign policy in 2002 and 2003 . </s>
And I think my concerns at the time were warranted . I knew that going into the war in Iraq was a mistake . So did Barack Obama . We couldn’t stop the administration from going in . </s>
I testified in front of Congress . I warned -- of course we knew our armed forces were going to do great . Why not ? We’ve been practicing and building for it for years and years and years . </s>
It’s the war that everyone expected to fight . It was like , why is it taking us so long ? So we went in there and just as we expected in three weeks or less , we were in Baghdad and Baghdad fell and that was the end of it and the troubles began . </s>
The truth is , when we’re talking about American foreign policy , it didn’t begin on the 21st of January , 2009 . And so I want to establish three things tonight . First , that Barack Obama began in a deep hole . And the first rule of when you’re in a deep hole is stop digging and start getting out of it . </s>
The second thing is I think he’s doing a lot of things right , and third I want to address some of the things that Dan brought up here . So first of all , the deep hole . </s>
I don’t think there’s been any period in American foreign policy and domestic policy where we’ve seen so many crises and difficulties . </s>
It started with 9/11 when the administration basically ignored the experience of the Clinton administration , didn’t pay enough attention to terrorism and we got clobbered . It then went into a war in Afghanistan that didn’t target the correct enemy , that was just a scattering of bombs . Osama bin Laden was there ; the military was never told to get him and he went to Pakistan . Then we withdrew our intelligence assets ; we prepared to go to war with Iraq which for a variety of reasons that have never been fully explained , the administration was insistent on doing . </s>
That easy victory turned into a drawn-out , very expensive , very difficult insurgency . In the process , we lost friends and allies as they all fell by the wayside except for a couple of great allies like Britain and Italy . But the Europeans rightly had questions about how necessary this war was . We were no more in the deep insurgency then Katrina came and Hugo Chavez and others had to offer assistance to the United States because we couldn’t seem to take care of our own problems in Katrina . And then followed up by the financial collapse of 2007 , 2008 which really put us in a hole as a nation that was in decline . </s>
So Barack Obama had a very tough road to hoe . I think he’s doing a lot of things right . He’s starting by trying to make more friends and fewer enemies in the world , so he’s reached out a hand of friendship to the Islamic world . His speech in Cairo was incredibly well received . He was nominated and received a Nobel Peace Prize based on the atmosphere he projected and that atmosphere goes a long way in international relations . </s>
He 's kept our military strong . He has doubled down in Afghanistan . He 's made it clear that there will be no easy path for terrorists in the United States . </s>
He stayed very tough on homeland security . He stuck with the commitments America made in Iraq . </s>
He 's got a team in the Pentagon and elsewhere that will follow through on the effective policies of the previous administration and modify them where necessary . So I think he 's doing a lot of things right in terms of keeping us safe . </s>
I think in terms of his work with NATO , they 've made very strong presentations at the NATO summit . </s>
We brought in new members in NATO , Albania and Croatia , helping to fill out the Balkans and bring stability into that region . </s>
And we 've worked on other areas like trying to open up Burma . He 's broadened the dialogue so that when we go to the Asia Pacific economic groups and OCEON and talk over there , we 're not just talking about pursuing terrorists . We 're talking about all the other things that are important for us . And he 's taken a major role in international economic affairs . And really , there is nothing more important for America at this point after you keep America safe than to rebuild this economy and to work with our friends and allies around the world to do that . </s>
And he 's doing all of that . </s>
As far as Iran is concerned , and here I want to turn to the third point , let 's talk about Iran . </s>
Because of going into Iraq , the Bush administration was never able to bring moral force or intelligence to bear on Iran . In fact , there was an erroneous intelligence report in 2007 that said they 'd given up their nuclear program . So let 's give the president time to sort of get traction in world affairs . He 's had it . He 's brought consensus to bear in the United Nations that Iran is not complying . </s>
All options are on the table . That chapter is not over by a long shot , I would predict . As far as missile defense is concerned , there is a better way to do it . </s>
That 's a missile defense that we have right now on our navy ships that can intercept mid course . We may need to go back to Europe at a later time when Iranians deploy an inner continental ballistic missile , but they 're a long way from having it right now . Inside Eastern Europe , the policy of putting the missile interceptors and the radars on the ground had adherence . It also had opponents . And what Barack Obama has done is focused on the essential element which is the rationale for putting those interceptors in place and the radar in place . </s>
That was to deter and reassure vis-a-vis Iran . </s>
And that 's exactly what the policy he announced will do . Our Navy can do those intercepts . We do have that capability . </s>
It will be -- much more effective against Iran than the system that was being placed in the Czech Republic and Poland . I ca n't comment on what President Sarkozy said about Barack Obama 's naivety . </s>
I 'll leave those kinds of personal comments aside . </s>
But I think what you do have in the president is a man who is experienced in the world , a man who looks at the other side as well as what his own feelings are , someone who 's running a pragmatic non-ideological policy , someone who 's shown he 's tough . He 's hard headed . He means what he says . He 's going to take America and lead us forward . </s>
I think you have to vote no to the idea that President Barack Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline . That 's a no . Thank you . Thank you , Wesley Clark . We 're halfway the opening statements portion of this debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan of ABC News serving as moderator . We have four debaters ; two teams of two who are fighting it out over this motion : “Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline.” You have heard the first two debaters . </s>
Now , on to the third . I would like to introduce Mort Zuckerman who is chairman and editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report , and publisher of the New York Daily News , and I know that you 're wounded tonight . Do you prefer to sit or - - we appreciate that in pain and with a cane , you made it here . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Mort Zuckerman . If you thought you were in pain before I spoke , wait until you see what it 's going to be like after I speak . Good evening . I want to share with the other speakers the measure of being a part of this wonderful group and to speak to this audience . Let me just say when President Obama came into office , it was really a quiet sigh of relief around the world . </s>
He was n't George Bush . The expectations -- No , I do n't mean that . I think there was a huge concern in the world about the nature of American leadership at that point . And the expectations about President Obama were exceedingly high . </s>
Now , any president of the United States really inherits a great legacy . We stand at the top of the power ladder . We are not a dominant power but we 're the leading power . We 're the only power that can coordinate and coalesce groups of nations . Most countries distrust the United States less than they distrust one another . </s>
So they look for Washington -- to Washington for leadership . And they look for Washington to support them against regional opponents and other threats . They know they can not solve most of these problems without the United States . </s>
And they need our leadership in the most severe and serious way . </s>
Now , my sense , however , is that President Obama on this level is uncomfortable with this role for the United States . He seems to be uncomfortable in leading a lot of other nations . </s>
And almost feels that there is nothing special about America 's role in the world . </s>
What you have , it seems to me , is too much well intentioned belief in the power of rhetoric , good will , and too little appreciation of reality . The former president of the Council of Foreign Relations , Les Gelb put it , there is the impression that Obama confuses speeches with policies . Now , foreign policy entails an understanding of the cultural historical and personal political circumstances of those we are dealing with . And this is where I think we have a real problem . Because there is , I think , a critical mass of influential people in world affairs who once held high hopes for this president and have begun to wonder whether or not they have misjudged the man . </s>
In the Middle East they always talk about the following . There are two chess games that are always being played in the Middle East . One is the chess board that you see on top of the table . The other is the chess board that is below the table that nobody sees except the people who know how to play the game . And the sense that they have is that this administration does not know how to play the game and has made mistake after mistake after mistake to the point where there is really an erosion of confidence in the United States and limitation therefore on what we can accomplish . </s>
And it also has contributed to a growing perception that Obama 's management of American power is almost amateurish . He tends to speak as a teacher rather than as a leader . </s>
Now , in meetings with many of the leaders of the Arab world , particularly the Sunni leaders , they fear an expansionist Iran proceeding with full speed ahead on a program to develop nuclear weapons on top of programs testing intermediate range missiles . </s>
I will give you an illustration of how a major foreign leader of an Arab country put it to me . When you remember Obama said if people extend a hand to shake our hands instead of a fist , we will shake that hand . He says the problem with Iran is you ca n't deal with it by shaking their hand . You have to deal with them by showing that your capable of exercising the fist . </s>
And that is what -- it is that understanding and that understanding of the culture , not just in the Middle East , but in many parts of the world that is missing . </s>
And what you have , you have the centrifuges continuing to spin in Iraq . And there is no sense , for example , when they had the uprising on the streets of Iran , that we were there with them , that we were on , as Fouad Ajami put it , on freedom 's side . Now , the question is , is Iran going to be emboldened by what they see and experience as American weakness and the lack of real willpower ? </s>
Well , as long as the Arab foreign -- the Arab foreign ministers put it the following one . </s>
One of them said -- now , this is a quote . He said they are hopelessly naive . </s>
The Americans are hopelessly naive . And they -- in that part of the world , naivety is not just naivety . </s>
It is seen as weakness as it really gives the impression that the leadership does not have the stuff that real leaders are made of . </s>
And that is the feeling that they have about America these days . Now , this is what French President Sarkozy was referring to . In fairness to what we said . </s>
Obama basically comes and gives a speech about would n't it be nice if the world did not have any nuclear weapons . Yes , it would . He basically said this is almost an alternative universe . It 's as if nuclear weapons could be banished from the face of the earth . They can not be he said and Sarkozy pointed out , that there are two countries he said , that’s in the meeting in which the president was in the audience . </s>
He said there are two countries right in front of us doing the exact opposite , referring of course to North Korea and Iran , an Iran that had ignored five U.N. resolutions on this issue alone . In the later diplomatic push , vis-a- vis Iran and North Korea : that yielded nothing . </s>
Sarkozy said we are right to talk about the future as the president was referring , but we also have to worry about the present and here you have these two countries , members of the United Nations who are pursuing exactly the policies that we find inimical . We’ve got to find some way to deal with the present he said and not with the future . </s>
In fact he pointed to the President -- looked at the President and said , this is not the real world that you are talking about ; this is the virtual world . </s>
Now this is in the full presence of many leaders of the United Nations in the audience and the French President says to an American President , you have to admit that the world is upside down when the French President sounds much stronger than the American one . And this is what it seems to me is what we have to address here . Now , it is , I can add to those things you’ve heard the references to when Obama withdrew the promises of ABM defenses , two countries in Central Europe , perhaps thinking that he might appease Russia into abrogating their patronage of Iran’s nuclear ambitions . Well frankly this has obviously failed and now in Central Europe , there is a fear that the United States may no longer be a reliable guarantor of their security . My time is up -- </s>
Thank you very much . Well let me just , if I may just close . I just want to say one thing about this . </s>
What we are talking about here is an ability to play the game and an understand of how to play to the game and play the game well and effectively . That is what I see us lacking in the Obama administration and why it makes me feel that we are on the decline . Thank you , Mort Zuckerman . Our motion is , “Obama’s foreign policy spells America’s decline.” And our final speaker I’m very pleased to say is a European , given that we are speaking about foreign policy , I’d like to introduce Bernard-Henri Lévy , French philosopher and public intellectual . </s>
I would love to see the business card that says philosopher and public intellectual . He has written extensively about the United States , very often in positive tones and he is here tonight to argue against the motion that Obama’s foreign policy spells America’s decline . Ladies and gentlemen , Bernard-Henri Lévy . Bernard-Henri Lévy : Yes , absolutely against for sure . </s>
In this debate I will have a big handicap and a little advantage . The big handicap is unfortunately my terrible and pitiful English . I must apologize . And my little advantage is to look at this topic , at this motion from outside and maybe from a slightly objective point of view . When you speak about Obama’s foreign policy spelling America’s decline , what do people think ? </s>
Number one , they speak about the weakness , the supposed weakness of Barack Obama , his practice of compromise , his taste for compromise and so on . I think it is not true . I think that Obama , as I see him from outside , tries to compromise , does -- makes the most he can do with compromise and when it does not work , for example , when Syria proves to be continuing to bring some heavy weapons to a fascist party which is Hezbollah , then sanctions in strength . Barack Obama , as did any of your last presidents , believes in strengths but he believes in strengths as the great strategies , as Sun Tzu , Machiavelli , holding the fire and not this zero degree of strengths which is just Jacksonian politics . </s>
The second thing which is meant when one speaks about Barack Obama spelling the decline of America alludes to the fact that Obama would not be supportive enough to his natural allies and too much supportive for his enemies . I don’t think so at all . I just believe that he does what the foreign policy must do . Foreign policy by definition speaks with enemies , speaks with ugly leaders , and in the respect of the natural alliance . I happen to be one of the Europeans who have had the chance to speak with Barack Obama about Israel six years ago before he was even candidate . </s>
My feeling again from outside is that to say that Barack Obama would not be supportive enough to the old natural allies of America is just untrue . </s>
Number three : the reproach , which is criticized , which is done to Barack Obama is that he speaks a lot and acts not enough . I 'm not sure that he acts so little . I have one personal experience , rather recent , in Afghanistan . </s>
I was in the Uzbin Valley with some of your guys embedded in an American unit . </s>
I saw that the strategy of General McChrystal endorsed by your president is not so bad and is producing some real results on the ground . But this be put aside , it is true the Barack Obama speaks , speaks a lot , but why does he speak so much ? Bernard-Henri Lévy : He speaks because he knows that foreign policy has changed its stage , that the new stage of foreign policy has new actors . </s>
And especially one new actor : not only the , not only Sarkozy , not only the big leader of the world or the little leaders of the world , but the public opinion . Barack Obama understood that to have a real foreign policy supposes to address directly the world public opinion , that it is the only chance to achieve some real results as he did , for example , with the speech of Cairo . The other criticism which is done to Barack Obama is to admit too easily the rise of new powers and the subsequent diminution of the American influence : power of Russia , power of China , and so on . But again , who is really spelling the decline ? Those who still believe in the world of yesterday , frozen in old schemes , or those who try to understand the world which is coming with a new lens , with new glasses , and trying to maintain the rank of America in this new world ? </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : Barack Obama just knows that China is becoming a big power . </s>
He just knows that Russia is an actor de-freezing itself from the old Stalinist era . He knows that he has to deal with that and he does . </s>
And the last reproach which is done to him is about exceptionalism . I read that Barack Obama is getting rid of this old American creed which is exceptionalism . And why ? Because he apologized for Abu Ghraib , for Guantanamo , for torture , and so on . </s>
I believe the contrary . I believe that only dictators never apologize . </s>
And I believe that when you apologize , it means that you believe in your creed , that you believe in your values , and you believe in their superiority . Barack Obama more than ever believes in the house shining on the hill and that 's why I vote no on the motion , he does not spell American decline . Thank you , Bernard-Henri Lévy . </s>
That concludes opening statements for this Intelligence U.S. Squared debate . Here is where we are . We are about to enter into the part of the debate where the debaters address each other directly , and we also bring in you , the members of the audience , to ask questions . The way that we 'll do that , is when we come to the questions is for you to raise your hand and I find you . </s>
There will be ushers with microphones . They 'll bring a microphone to you . We 'll ask you to stand . </s>
If you 're a member of the news media or have any other relevant or interesting affiliation , we 'd appreciate it if you 'd share that with us . And when you get the microphone , if you can hold it about that far , distance away from your mouth , so that the radio broadcast where be able to hear you . Before the debate , we had you vote on where you stood on our motion , “Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline , ” and we now have the results of that vote . </s>
Before the debate , this is where it stands , 23 % of you are for the motion , 45 % are against the motion , and 32 % are undecided . That 's where it stands now at the end of the debate we 'll have you vote once again and the team that has changed the most minds during the course of the argument will be declared our winner . So now on to round two where the debaters address each other directly . We have here at the Skirball Center for the Performing Arts in New York University , the teams of two , Dan Senor and Mortimer Zuckerman who are arguing that Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline . They have made the argument that President Obama has snubbed old friends . </s>
On the other side , Wesley Clark and Bernard-Henri Lévy , who have made the argument that President Obama is setting out to make new friends . What we 're really talking about on some level in terms of the person of President Obama is the matter of respect . Does the world respect him ? I want to put that question to both sides briefly . </s>
First to the team for the motion . Is President Obama respected ? And is it the right kind of respect ? Mortimer Zuckerman . I 'm going to speak with a French accent , if you do n't mind . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : This is unfair . I will quote a major Asian leader who said -- very well-known Asian leader who said in the world of Asia , in the leadership of Asia which is the leadership that runs that part of the world -- we are concerned that Obama does not have the strength to confront his enemies , and we fear that he does not have the strength to support his friends . Now , I 'm not saying that there is n't an expanded role for the media in many different parts of the world . In terms of the way political decisions and political power is exercised , I would ask you to think , if I may , do you think that the ability to speak is influencing the way political decisions are made in those parts of the world where we are trying to influence ? Do we think that we are getting through to the leadership because Obama gives speeches ? </s>
So you do not think he 's respected ? No , I think he is respected . I do n't think he is effective . </s>
To the other side . </s>
Wesley Clark . I think he is effective . I think what he 's done first is set up a base of public understanding for his values and America 's values , and his vision . And I think he 's very effectively captured world opinion on that . </s>
He 's , then , set about restoring the relationship with allies , fulfilling his responsibilities to protect the United States which he 's done , and then trying to work to head off the greatest challenges we face . So for example , you were talking about nuclear weapons , Mort . And he called together a nuclear non proliferation summit in Washington . People came . And it was important . </s>
And it was a private meeting . And they came because they respect him and they respect what he stands for in the United States of America . </s>
I think most of us would agree that the greatest single threat we face right now is a nuclear weapon in the hands of terrorists . And that 's the problem Barack Obama is focusing on . So I give him high marks for the summit . </s>
I give him high marks for moving ahead with the symbolism of a start agreement with Russia to reduce levels of nuclear weapons . And I give him high marks for the general focus that he 's brought to bear on looking to prevent future problems from emerging . Dan Senor . Yeah , I would just say that the fear of nuclear weapons getting to the hands of terrorists is not really an abstract debate . </s>
I mean Iran , according to IAEA , according to our own intelligence community Iran will have some sort of nuclear weapon , some sort of breakout capacity very soon : two years , three years . That’s really quick , 2015 perhaps , 2016 . We still don’t have a Security Council resolution despite high approval , public opinion approval of President Obama around the world . The Chinese won’t get on board , the Russians won’t get on board . </s>
The Iranians basically say and the IEAE says , that Iran has mastered something like 3000 centrifuges , enough to actually build a weapon . I mean , speeches and personal biography and personal charisma are wonderful , they’re nice ; I think people around the world like us . I think they’re just limited commodities in foreign affairs . </s>
Nations -- You’re saying the goodwill does not translate . Nations don’t make major decisions about their security because President Obama gives a nice speech . </s>
They do what’s in their interests . </s>
So I guess I would ask either of you , show me one example , one , that has generated any benefit in response to Obama’s wonderful speeches . What have we gotten ? </s>
I mean the ultimate measure is Iran’s about the build a nuclear bomb so what have his speeches done to arrest that progress . Bernard ? Bernard-Henri Lévy : I give you two examples . Barack Obama is your first president and first leader of high rank that has said that the risk of the terrorist group having a nuclear device in their hands will happen , could happen in Pakistan . He is the first one who has designated Pakistan as a major problem . </s>
You had a president who said it was Iraq and who looked for the nuclear weapons with a lamp torch . Bernard-Henri Lévy : Barack Obama said that the problem is in Pakistan . This changed all the deal inside Pakistani power , inside the ISI , and more importantly inside civil society in Pakistan . Example number two . Wait , while we hold that because I want to Bernard-Henri Lévy : Two examples . </s>
Because number one , that is your big get , is that Obama said that Pakistan poses a threat ? </s>
One of the rationales that Bush used for going into Afghanistan is that Pakistan could follow and has its hands on nuclear weapons and those nuclear weapons could get in the wrong hands . Your big get is that Obama basically confirmed something we all know . Let’s here number two , example number two . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : President Bush during his 8 years delivered huge , unconditional , untied aid to Pakistan government without any conditions regarding the topic we are speaking today . Barack Obama has changed that and this is not speech , this is act . Number two : the speech of Cairo . </s>
You know , the best way to help your friends is to disarm the enemies of your friends and the speech of Cairo had one concrete effect , which is to comfort the moderates in Islam , to isolate the people of al-Qaeda , the fanatics and the integrists , to divide the Muslim world , and this is -- Bernard-Henri Lévy : Which has concrete effects on the ground , I can tell you . I know Pakistan ; I went in Algeria ; I went in Afghanistan , the new strategy of McChrystal for example , today consisting of isolating the Taliban inside the civil society , demonstrating to the people in Afghanistan that their interest is not to protect the Taliban . </s>
Hamas is stronger today than it was a year ago . Syria’s announced or it’s been reported that Syria’s sending Katyusha rockets to Lebanon to give to Hezbollah and more sophisticated weaponry than that . I mean , Iran as I said is nowhere near slowing down their nuclear weaponization program . </s>
Exact -- so it was a great speech ; it was very moving , and it was a poetic . Dan , what Bernard is saying is that its concrete effect was to tell the moderates out there we are with you . </s>
Is that not meaningful ? I would say it’s nice , but at the end of the day , the moderates need to know that we are going to stand with them and exactly what has Barack Obama indicated in terms of what political capital and what resources America will expend to stand with these moderates ? You had an opportunity in Iran . It was a bona fide dissident movement , almost one year ago today . </s>
They were saying , where is America ? Throughout modern histories , you know Bernard , because you’ve been very active on these human rights issues . America’s leaders and American presidents have put a spotlight on dissident movements , whether it was the anti-apartheid movement in South Africa ; whether it was the Soviets dissident movement in the former Soviet Union , the oxygen for these movements is America keeping a spotlight on it . Our president was silent . In the first place , the inspiration for a lot of that movement came from the words of Barack Obama and his symbolism . </s>
Secondly -- Secondly , I think it 's very interesting that you want to ask what 's the benefit of a speech because one of the things that we should be talking about is concrete policies and specific actions . One of the things we did learn during the previous administration was that harsh rhetoric does n't help . Strong bull-headed rhetoric appeals to Americans , but it does n't change foreign affairs . </s>
It 's what Ahmadinejad wants . It helps him consolidate his grip on power when we call him names . So Barack Obama played a very clever strategy in that . It did n't work , but no -- </s>
you ca n't -- America , I 'm sorry . </s>
Even though I know that I would like to believe that America could cause a revolt inside Iran , we have been talking about a change in regime through six administrations , and it has n't happened in Iran yet . And so I do n't think it 's a legitimate criticism to say that Barack Obama gave a speech and the Iranian revolt against the Ahmadinejad did n't work . I mean that 's not cause and effect . But what is a demonstration of Barack Obama 's strength is his staying with his commitment in Iraq . </s>
It is reinforcing in Afghanistan . </s>
And there is not a leader in the world who would look at Barack Obama and say he made an easy decision on that . He did not pander to the American public . And those of you in this audience , I bet if you took a vote on that , the majority of this audience would not have supported him when he put those extra troops into Afghanistan , and yet that was the right call and it was a tough call . </s>
And he is recognized around the world for his courage in making that call . I , too , have talked to foreign leaders , and Mort , that 's what they tell me . Mort Zuckerman . Well , again , I hate to say this , but I think you 're speaking only to foreign leaders who speak with a French accent . I do n't know what else to tell you . </s>
No , that 's an unfair comment . Look . </s>
Let me just say that . The one area of the world where we have to worry about is frankly the Middle East . And there you have , I think , a couple of countries , and a couple of movements that are really threatening a lot of our allies , Iran being one . The movements in Hezbollah and Hamas , basically terrorist groups of that sort . </s>
For Syria to have just provided scud missiles or their equivalent to Hezbollah is changing the whole military context of the region . </s>
Nothing is stopping these people . And I do n't dismiss entirely the rhetoric of the president . I 'm just saying that in that part of the world you need a lot more than rhetoric . I do n't want to diminish what the value of rhetoric is . But you have to translate that into other policies that really do have an effect against the people who are threatening . </s>
Wesley Clark just talked about a concrete move of putting more troops into Afghanistan . That was n't rhetoric . I do n't disagree with that . I mean I was n't referring at that point -- at that point , we were in a position in Afghanistan , and there is an issue , a connection between Afghanistan and Pakistan as we all know . </s>
If there was a rationale for going into Afghanistan , it is to make sure that Pakistan does not collapse . Because they do have 120 or whatever the number of nuclear weapons they have , and that is the worst thing that would happen if they fall into the wrong hands . So in a sense , we are protecting Pakistan and all of that . </s>
So I do n't diminish that . </s>
I 'm not saying that everything he 's done is wrong . </s>
I 'm just saying that when you play this game out there , and it is , in a sense , an understanding of how to work in that community , I 'm afraid that the rhetoric that is being saluted here is not nearly as effective as you would say and the policies that would be effective are simple not being carried out . Our motion is “Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline , ” and in arguing for this motion , are you saying that decline has begun already , we 're in it ? Dan Senor . I think the prospect of decline is real . We are in an early stage of it . </s>
What is the -- And it can be arrested . As General Clark and Bernard said -- General Clark in his opening statement said that America was in decline when Obama took over , that we were in a deep hole . </s>
Then you 're arguing that we 're already in decline . And the question is now is Obama slowing it down ? And I would say that when you have a situation where leaders around the world , allies of ours , historic allies are openly calling us naive and questioning our commitment , and our loyalty , that will spell American decline because we ca n't do this on our own . </s>
And I want to ask a question . </s>
You know , I agree with you that George W. Bush was extremely -- I 'll be the first to admit , unpopular around the world . He got much bigger crowds opposing him traveling around the world than Barack Obama gets supporting him . </s>
But one thing President Bush did have is very deep relationships with leaders , Aznar in Spain , Harper in Canada , Howard in Australia , Blair in the U.K. , Sharon in Israel . And Putin in Russia . Hold on . </s>
Hold on . And that was an enormous mistake . And by the way , he basically stood by Georgia when Georgia went to war with Russia because of Russia 's provocation . </s>
So that was a big mistake by Bush , and I 'm glad he ultimately agreed to move off that outreach to Russia . But you look at these leaders . </s>
Blair , Berlusconi , Howard , Harper -- these leaders stood by Bush through thick and thin , even though their populations despised him . I ask you to -- tell me one leader today that has that kind of relationship with Obama . One leader around the world that is so moved by his speeches and so moved by the press release he put out saying that Pakistan has terrorists in it , point one leader that is willing to stand by him and who he has a very close alliance . Just one . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : I think it is because of my French accent that you did not get what I said . I suppose . Bernard-Henri Lévy : So I will repeat . The characteristic of the period where we are is that Berlusconi , Zapatero , and even Sarkozy might be less important today than the peoples , than the masses , the huge crowds who all over the world were fed by your rubbish anti- Americanism for ages , and who are slightly changing their mind . </s>
Maybe Sarkozy said that Barack Obama is naive , but -- Bernard-Henri Lévy : He made – Sarkozy is not so important . More important than Sarkozy is that you have , as you know , an annual poll judging the big leaders of the world . And Barack Obama , the last poll two months ago arrive at 46 or 48 -- Those polls do n't make policy . Governments make policy . </s>
There is not a single government ? That 's very nice . They applaud for him -- </s>
Tell me one leader . One leader . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : History is not made by Berlusconi . Real people , suffering people , losing their houses , suffering from terrorism , being fed up by fanaticism : this is a real actor of history . </s>
And in front of these people Barack Obama is much more popular than has been your -- </s>
I think the question you 're asking , Dan , is a naive question . I 'll tell you why . </s>
The inner Sarkozy in you . Because if you believe that leaders stand by the United States because of some personal relationship with the president , then you 're neglecting the whole political basis for their own mandate in their own country . So if you scratch -- </s>
If you scratch -- If you could scratch very deeply on someone like Prime Minister Blair , and no one has managed to scratch very deeply on him yet , he would tell you that he was trapped by his early support of the Bush administration in Iraq . He has defended it and defended and defended it because that 's what political leaders do . </s>
But if you talk to the people who were around him at the time , and were there , and all of a sudden we jumped in without a second UN Security Council resolution , he thought he could influence President Bush the way he could influence President Clinton . He signed up on his team , he jumped in there and it turned out there was no influence at all . </s>
But political leaders act for their own survival . </s>
That 's what motivates political leaders . Berlusconi , Blair -- all those people saw they had to hang on to the commitments and the statements they had previously made . They could n't back away from them , not because of their great respect for an American president but because of their own domestic politics . </s>
Put this in terms of Obama’s presidency in two sentences ; its relevance . He’s going to make smart policy decisions . </s>
He’s going to bring the people of the world with him . He’s going to moderate the domestic opponents around the world of our policies . He’s going to make it easier for foreign leaders to agree with and support us . So Dan , you need a shot back . These have been two arguments against your point that the personal relationships are critical . </s>
Yeah , I want to be clear here . It is clear that political leaders make decisions based on the domestic political situation . </s>
In fact , several of the leaders I cited lost their elections because of their commitment to standing with the United States under President Bush . Two : security matters . Probably security matters and I have a slightly less cynical view ; security matters to these leaders , in many cases more than politics . And it was because not of some personal emotional relationship that they had with President Bush . I’m sorry if my American accent , I wasn’t able to make my point clear . </s>
Their sense of loyalty to President Bush was because of his commitment to them and his commitment to the security of their country which is what they ultimately care about and his commitment to security abroad . And those leaders were willing to go the mat even if it meant risking their political careers to stand with him . </s>
You say Tony Blair was trapped . To this day , Tony Blair is out of office . To this day , he defends the decisions he made . So I come back to you , you say policy makers don’t matter when it comes to policy ? I mean that’s the most inverted metric I’ve ever heard . </s>
Policy makers make policy , and I don’t see a single policy maker in the world today despite the millions of people who have this affection for President Obama , which I think is heartfelt ; I don’t see a single policy maker that is willing to stand up and go toe to toe and lock arms with this president . And I -- I think if they believed he was committed to them , that you’d have a different outcome . I want to move on to some other topics . Bernard , I want to move on to some other topics . </s>
This may go on forever and I do want to move on . I want to -- and I say that with respect , but it’s beginning to circle . I want to go to the audience for some questions . If you raise your hand , we’ll bring up the lights a little bit more so perhaps I can see . </s>
But before we do that , I just want to go to a specific example to put this in more concrete terms and I would like to talk about China . </s>
Dan Senor , take on the president’s performance in China . It was stunning . I’ve never heard such unanimous criticism of a president’s visit to China from across the political spectrum from the left and the right in the United States . It was a humiliating experience . </s>
The Chinese were allowed to censor his speech on the ground . The Chinese were allowed to choose who could attend this speech . </s>
Students as you know , many students were kept out and he left China with no concessions from the Chinese . Normally when presidents go , even if they intend to somewhat humiliate the president , they at least give them a couple of crumbs to leave with . We didn’t get anything . Here we are today , Iran is on the cusp of developing a nuclear weapon and China still won’t support sanctions on the U.N. Security Council , still won’t support sanctions . </s>
By the way they won’t support sanctions in Sudan ; they won’t support sanctions anywhere . So , I keep coming back to my question , what do we get ? What have we gotten for this new posture ? Response from the other side ? </s>
Wesley Clark ? First of all , I’m not going to go into the details of the president’s trip to China except to say that our relationship with the Chinese is one of mutual need . We need them ; they need us and he’s working to define that relationship in a most constructive way . Now , whether or not China ultimately support sanctions on Iran in the United Nations is not going to be the decisive factor , I would predict , in this president’s decision about what to do about Iran . </s>
So a lot of the case that has been made by the other side is predicated on hypothetical decline . </s>
Hypothetically , Iran’s going to get this , hypothetically Barack Obama’s not going to do that or something of the sort ; I don’t think the record demonstrates that . I think what the record demonstrates is a very systematic working with other nations and preparing the ground for what’s going to be a very difficult decision . </s>
But I think Dan Senor was also talking about process and his point was also that the President’s trip left the impression of weakness . Well he certainly did and what’s more , I think there was a wide sense within the Chinese leadership that he was weak . </s>
This was the worst visit of any president that has been made to China and it is a critical country , whether or not they support what we want to do vis-a-vis Iran or not . We came out of that with a greatly diminished sense of prestige or status or whatever , which are -- these are things that are very important to Chinese political culture . And to deny that is to deny really what happened . That was the reality of it . </s>
You can argue why it happened . I think it was very poor staff work on the part of the president 's team . But whatever it was , it worked out in the worst way . They did not understand how to play the game with the Chinese . Bernard-Henri Lévy . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : My impression was not the same . I think that there are two ways of considering the relationship between America and China . One way , which probably would have been the way of another president , is conflict , opposition , revival of Cold War . </s>
We have an enemy . We have a new bipolar world . </s>
We have to win this battle . Cold War is still alive . This would be one way . The other way is to say that there is a partnership , that there is a new order of the world of which the Chinese are real partners , economical partners , financial partners . You know better than me . </s>
I am not an economist , that they own a huge quantity of American bonds and so on . The impression which was released , which was delivered by Obama 's visit was the impression of a non-hysterical relationship , of a real partnership , of new ground , a new departure for a relationship based , of course , on different visions of the world ; a totalitarian regime on one side , the embodiment of modern democracy on the other side , but nevertheless a constructive partnership . And for this , we have to thank Barack Obama to have given this impression . And -- </s>
Let me go to somebody else here . Bernard-Henri Lévy : There is some road to be done still , of course . The road is not over . </s>
It 's not the end . Gentleman on the aisle . That is a very optimistic vision of what happened on Barack 's visit to China . I do n't think there is a single -- I have n't seen -- and I 've read most of them , maybe not all of them . I have n't seen a single person who understands what goes on in China , who thought that was a successful visit that in fact we came out with an enhanced relationship . </s>
Quite the opposite . It was a diminished relationship . I just -- you can give any interpretation you want to it , but I really can not accept that description of what happened . </s>
Yes , sir . My name is Eric Edelman . I 'm a retired foreign service officer and former undersecretary of Defense for Policy . I 'd like to direct a question to General Clark . </s>
But before I do , I 'd like to associate myself with the comments that Dan opened the debate with about General Clark 's service as supreme allied commander . </s>
During Bosnia , I was the U.S. ambassador to Finland at that time and was proud to be working by his side . But I do have a somewhat critical question about the comment you made with regard to the administration 's phased adaptive approach for missile defense announced last September in Eastern Europe . Putting aside the rather unfortunate timing announcing the decision on the 40th anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Poland to the Poles , the phased adaptive approach eight months on still has not got a deployment plan that the Department of Defense has been able to describe to the Congress . They ca n't say how many Aegis ships with the SM3 , block 1A and B missiles will be deployed , where they 'll be deployed . </s>
Will they be deployed in the Black Sea ? And these are important questions , given that the CBO study of missile defense -- Eric ? -- described the -- I just want to ask you to translate yourself slightly . </s>
Yes . I mean , this is a pretty smart audience , but I just want to ask you if you could find a slightly more generic way , slightly more generic way . The question is the general said that the phased adaptive approach the administration is deploying would provide greater capability . </s>
My question is , how can you judge that when we do n't know what the deployment plan is ? If you know what the capability of the Aegis cruisers are , what the missiles are and what they could do when deployed there , then you have a pretty good appreciation for what it can do to protect the nations in the region when those ships are deployed . Now , like you , I have n't seen a plan . I 'm not in on the classified planning , and I do n't know why it has n't been released . </s>
And I ca n't defend it . Should it have been released ? Should it have been out there ? Should it have been briefed to the allies ? </s>
Well , we could discuss that . I do n't know whether it should have or not because I 'm not on the inside of the policy-making apparatus . You 're raising valid questions , and I am sure that the administration has thought of those questions . </s>
I hope they have answers to them . </s>
They should . Gentleman in the blue shirt . </s>
Hi . My name is Stu Weiss . I 'm a physician here in New York . My question is for the people on the “for” side . </s>
I want to go back to Europe for a moment . So just yesterday , the European Central Bank decided to support the euro and to do one of the biggest bailouts in I think in history of several European countries . That was in spite the objections of Germany and several other countries . And the New York Times reported today that their objections were overcome in large part because of the actions of the administration and President Obama . Does that not show that he is still a significant influence in Europe and still projects some strength among our allies and friends in Europe that they could overcome their reluctance and bail out -- and support the euro ? </s>
Yes , I would say that does show that there is influence on the part of the president in terms of issues like this . What we are also contending with , and let 's be candid about it , most of the debt of these countries is in the hands of the European banks . Were those banks to go under because they did n't work out a plan , you would have had a major economic catastrophe in Europe . And it would have spilled over into the United States . Our own economic policies , I might say , leave something to be desired too in terms of building up deficits as far as the eye can see , that are going to really transform the economic wherewithal with which this country has been the bulwark of freedom in this world . </s>
And it 's going to be a growing problem for us . But to have Europe collapse at this point , the United States had to put whatever influence they could to bear on these decisions . </s>
And I am glad they did , and I 'm glad it worked out because otherwise we would have had a major collapse . So somewhat , you give good points to the White House on this one ? </s>
Yes , absolutely , I do . I 'm not -- I do n't think everything the White House does is bad . Do n't get me wrong on that . </s>
But I think on this -- Fair enough . </s>
-- absolutely . Fair enough . Ma'am ? Let 's let the microphone come to you . Thank you . </s>
Hi . How are you ? My name is Kamini Kendika Abdul , and I 'm a resident of New Jersey . In terms of policy changing and making , this question is for Dan Senor . I think he does -- President Obama has some say in the world in policy changing , specifically in Afghanistan and the treatment of women sexually . </s>
I noticed in the news that there was a new policy change . </s>
So how do you equate what 's of benefit in policy changes versus a deficit ? And just to clarify , you feel that his statements had impact ? </s>
Oh , I do feel that he has some kind of an impact . No , I mean -- Because he is against -- Right . </s>
Okay . He 's against the old policy of women and sexuality in Afghanistan . </s>
Right . But you think it 's having -- it 's not that it 's being -- just being well received , but you think it 's actually having an effect . </s>
Well , it did actually have an impact . They changed the law . And -- </s>
Okay . That 's what I wanted to nail down . Dan Senor . </s>
I am the first to credit the president on some of the progress in Afghanistan . </s>
What I 'm saying is it does n't compensate for a complete realignment of U.S. foreign policy in every other corner of the world . So it is very important what you just cited about women 's rights in Afghanistan . </s>
At the same time , the government of Russia , with whom this president celebrates a reset of relationships , is engaged in a fierce political repression of opponents , is murdering journalists . Putin is probably going to run for president in 2012 again . That 's what it looks like . Dissident leaders like Boris Nemtsov who I hosted when he came over here from Moscow about a year and a half ago , could n't get any hearing inside the administration . Iran , I mean , the dissident movement in Iran was basically left on their own , left hung out to dry . </s>
And the notion of the president not putting a spotlight on them , as General Clark said , somehow would weaken the Iranian regime . The Iranian regime blamed us and demonized us no matter what when he did . And they were more than happy to do it even though we were silent . And as I said , here we are a year later . The dissident movement is weaker than it was a year ago . </s>
And Iran is closer to getting a nuclear weapon . </s>
I think that makes the world a less stable place . And I think it is more consistent with American decline than it is American ascendancy . If Iran develops a nuclear weapon capability , we will have a nuclear arms race in the Middle East the likes of which we have never seen . </s>
And this is not like a hypothetical thing . The news reports coming out of Egypt and out of Saudi Arabia , out of Yemen of this happening . Dan , I want to interrupt you because I want to bring it back to the question and let Wesley respond as well to the question . And if you felt that you were mischaracterized by Dan , I 'm going to give you a crack at that . But the question was asking about the impact of the president 's remarks about the rights of women . </s>
And she 's claiming that it has some sort of real impact . And I think , Dan , you 're saying , yeah , maybe it does , but it 's not enough . Yeah , it’s important , it just does n't compensate for foreign policy framework . No . </s>
I accept what Dan says . It is important . It 's certainly not the whole plank of our foreign policy . </s>
It 's an example of how a statement by a leader can have an impact . </s>
I agree that the question of Iran is hanging over our president as the judgment of his foreign policy . </s>
You know , before he was elected , he did go to Israel and he did speak to AIPAC and he made very clear he would not tolerate Iran having nuclear weapons . Every candidate did that -- both parties . So this is something that he 's worked on assiduously . </s>
The administration 's very well aware that this challenge is coming up . They 're laying the groundwork to take effective action . </s>
And you know the verdict of history will await . He 's going to have to make the call . But I do n't want to minimize the significance of this decision because Dan is exactly right on this . </s>
This is a pivotal decision in the future of the Middle East , the future of nonproliferation , and the future of the world security structure as we know it . </s>
And that 's why he called the nuclear nonproliferation summit . That 's why he reaffirmed America 's commitment that we undertook in the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty to eventual nuclear disarmament . That 's why he 's working to line up the support of public opinion , and it 's moving in our direction , China notwithstanding for their own personal and economic reasons . </s>
So at this point this is one of those decisions that 's going to have to be made at some point , but it has n't been made , the time has n't come yet to make that decision , and I think the whole world will await the outcome of the president 's decision on this . </s>
So your question was n't about Iran but precisely in a sense , but I want to move on , but you got us into an interesting area . </s>
Sir , yes , you 're pointing to yourself , and if you can stand , thank you . You were the only one doing that . </s>
Matt : Thank you , my name 's Matt . I 'm from Brooklyn . </s>
My question is directed at Mr. Zuckerman . It was mentioned that you were a supporter of Barack Obama during the campaign so it seems to me that he campaigned on this policy of engagement that you oppose , and has only become more -- his policy in places like Afghanistan and Pakistan -- it 's only become more muscular , alienating his base since he has come into office . So I 'm wondering how you can explain that discrepancy . And I have another question , just very short for everybody . I 'm only going to take one question . </s>
Matt : Okay . That 's just one of our rules . Well , yes , I did support -- You 're saying he 's not engaging enough . Obama , yes , I 'm saying that engagement is not enough to deal with the issues that we have to deal with , not in Iran , frankly , not in the Soviet Union , not with China , and not in the Middle East . </s>
I 'm not dismissing engagement . It 's just not enough . And as I say , the view that so many of them have is that they do n't think he is going to be tough enough to deal with the issues that really have to be dealt with in a tough-minded way . </s>
I hope that they are wrong and I hope that I am wrong . But the evidence so far frankly is not encouraging , and frankly when you deal with those people , they are not encouraged . I mean , this is not something that I 'm making out of thin air . I promise you that this is what they are saying and what they are very concerned about . </s>
So I support engagement but engagement is one hand , the other hand is they have to -- you have to be able to deal not just with a handshake but with a clenched fist . I need to say something for the radio broadcast . We are in the question and answer section of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . </s>
I 'm John Donvan as moderator . We have four debaters ; two teams of two , who are arguing over this motion , `` Obama 's Foreign Policy Spells America 's Decline . '' And , sir , just , you can nod or not , I just want to ask you your critique of the President 's performance is more a critique from the left , that he 's become too muscular , am I correct about that , that you 're citing that critique ? So he 's getting it from the other side , and I believe for now that 's also the case often in Europe , that where people are disappointed in Europe with the President is that , in fact , he did send troops into Afghanistan and that he went to accept his Nobel Prize and made an argument in support of war and certain causes , and that , in fact , they thought he was too tough , which is the opposite of this side . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : There are not so many critics against Obama in Europe . I do n't think so . What is very positive and very positively appreciated in Europe is that Obama engaged some troops in Afghanistan , maybe not enough according to some , but with some concrete , effective , and important results on the ground . This is an important point , with some troops , not as many as some would have wanted some real results , two sorts of results , and you have to be very concrete and go into details to appreciate these sort of things . Number one , as I said , inside of Afghanistan , isolation of the Taliban . </s>
This is a new reality on the ground . The Taliban are less and less fish in water in some of the valleys where they were kings a few months ago . Number two , I happened to be -- I’m sorry but I was in Afghanistan two years ago and I saw some units , offensive units , which were American units , fighting units , with some Afghan scouts embedded in the American units . Two years after . </s>
Now , a few months ago , it is the reverse . </s>
You have some national Afghan battling units with some embedded American -- not scouts but mentors . I mean by that that the situation on the ground is changing , that the new strategy implemented by Barack Obama and his high command has begun to give its fruits . Let’s see if your opponents concede that point or not . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : It is concrete . I emphasize . Look . As I made it clear at the beginning of this talk this evening , I think President Obama’s decision to support General Petraeus and General McChrystal in Afghanistan was enormously important . </s>
I actually have deep concerns about Afghanistan right now , about the civilian/military coordination . I think we’re potentially heading for a crisis on the ground in Afghanistan as it relates to civilian-military coordination . But that said , I don’t take one ounce away from the President’s courageous decision on Afghanistan . </s>
To me , it’s important but it doesn’t make for a foreign policy . Bernard , look , I have been a great admirer of yours . Throughout your career you have advocated for human rights and the importance of standing with dissonant movements , even as a centerpiece of foreign policy . There were about 40 individuals that signed a letter to the President on the eve of his trip to Moscow asking to meet with opposition , with democratic opposition figures in Moscow while he was there . </s>
Only one leader from the Left in the United States signed it , the head of Amnesty International USA . And as one Left-wing blog commented , it’s a sad statement of the state of affairs that human rights has so been subordinated as a principle in our foreign policy that if someone from the Left wants to advocate for human rights being an important part of a president’s visit to Russia , to China , to any of these places , they have to sign a letter with a bunch of neocons like myself . It’s a sad statement of affairs , and I’m amazed that you are giving him a pass . Bernard-Henri Lévy : The question of human rights is also a question inside Islam . </s>
Today , the real shock of civilization is inside Islam , inside Islam between Islam , democratic Islam and integrist and fanatic Islam . In these battles , which is the most important battle of the moment , Obama is and his team and Clinton are playing a major role in separating the two in isolating the fanatics and the integrists from the moderates , in saying to the moderate Muslims that we are no longer their enemies . That we are on their side . </s>
That we’re facing the same problems and that we are sharing the same values . This also is human rights . </s>
Why -- Bernard-Henri Lévy : All over the Muslim world heard , listened , and heard the message . Can I ask you a question ? Why didn’t he give that exact speech you just gave when the dissidents were rising up in Iran ? </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : He did this in a way because it was a very complicated story . Mousavi was nearly under arrest , was threatened with death . You had some dissidents who were shot dead like Neda in the streets and this was a very responsible attitude to have in front of butchers . Ahmadinejad is not a president , he’s a butcher . </s>
And I think that the concern of every responsible Western leader was to avoid in Tehran a Tiananmen . There was the threat of a huge Tiananmen , ten times maybe more bloody than Tiananmen and I think that Obama acted not so badly between the human rights talks between the human right attitude and between the accountability in front of what could happen on the other side . Iranian regime 's response -- Iranian regime 's response made Tiananmen look like a day at the park . </s>
The regime was more repressive today than it has been at any time . </s>
The regime is stronger today than it has been -- Bernard-Henri Lévy : No , no . -- at any time . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : Let me ask you -- </s>
Let me finish . </s>
And Mousavi and his leaders were calling on America . Where is America ? Why is n't America putting a spotlight on our movement giving us the oxygen we need ? Let 's take them at their word . Bernard-Henri Lévy : No . </s>
Sir -- </s>
John , I have to come back . </s>
Okay , Wes , because you have n't been -- I have to come back on the human rights issue . Look , I do n't think the United States government under Barack Obama has moved one iota off its steadfast commitment to human rights every country in the world . Now , what there is , is a disagreement about tactics . </s>
There are some who believe that you should carry human rights on the top of the banner and use it in a provocative way when you 're making a visit abroad . There are others who believe that there 's a more constructive way to go at it . I 'm involved in a number of organizations , and I talk to people when I travel abroad , and I spied no difference in the solemn dedication of the United States government to human rights . But I do think that there is a difference in calling for human rights and making a big splash about it as a provocative gesture when you go into a country where you know you 're going to have conflict on this and trying to work behind the scenes and more quietly to actually improve the opportunity for human rights . </s>
And so that 's what this administration 's trying to do . Ma'am , if you do n't read your question , if you are holding a piece of paper , if you are prepared to just blurt it out , I 'll take your question and make it brief . </s>
Thanks . Do n't read . </s>
Ana : Hi . My name is Ana . I am a senior at the University of Vermont . And my questions are directed toward the opposition bench . </s>
Both of you spoke about how the leaders do what 's best for their country and how now public opinion is now more important and even considered the new actor when it comes to foreign policy . Why is it , then , when foreign policy is so important to public opinion , and public opinion says that what Obama did and his actions towards Israel and the Israeli government earlier this we 're year was inappropriate , he did not listen to public opinion until two bipartisan letters came to him from Congress ? If public opinion is so imperative to the president and his foreign policy , how come it took Congress to back it ? In that case , you 're talking about U.S. public opinion . </s>
Okay . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : I was not speaking about this public opinion only . </s>
Yeah , I did n't think so . Bernard-Henri Lévy : I was speaking about world public opinion . And I was saying that we are going out , we are leaving a policy of big hugs , of good buddies , Sarkozy , Bush and so on , and we have good friends , blah , blah , blah . This was the old politics . And George W. Bush was very good at that , at hugs with Sarkozy , with Berlusconi , with Aznar in Spain and so on . </s>
And that today we are facing , we are discovering a real moving actor which is the public opinion , the fighting public opinion in Iran , which is the women in Afghanistan , which is all the people around the world . And to these , Barack Obama addresses for the first time a language which goes at the same time to the brain and to the heart . It is -- I travel a lot . It is the first time since many years that I see that the flag of America is again a new , bright flag , meaning hope for a major part of the world , especially in the very deserted parts of the world . And this is a renew -- and it 's more important than the buddies , hugs between Sarkozy and George W. Bush . </s>
The gentleman with the brown blazer in the next aisle , white shirt . </s>
No , farther up . Yeah . yes , sir . </s>
Daniel Nadelman from New York City . </s>
Let 's assume that Barack Obama and the United States have every intention with or without Israeli 's assistance or cooperation , in taking out Iran 's nuclear capacity . </s>
If that 's the case , what sort of public foreign policy robust strength would you like to see Obama do between now and when that actually happens when they decide that 's the right time to happen , for him to demonstrate the type of strength that you 're showing , saying that he 's not actually demonstrating now ? There is a bill before Congress right now that would impose sanctions on Iran on the import of petroleum products which the Iranian economy is dependent on . The House has passed this legislation overwhelming . </s>
The Senate has passed it overwhelmingly legislatively , and it is in conference right now . </s>
The administration is opposed to it . I think that 's a grave mistake . Another question ? Because I have n't gone to the dark section near the camera up there . </s>
Yes . Yeah . You 're pointing to yourself again . If everybody points to yourself you can all stand up . Can you just step down a little bit into the brighter light so that we can see you and the camera can see you ? Thanks . </s>
If you just come out to the aisle . My name is Reese Schoenfeld , and I’m an occasional journalist . And I have an advantage of being a little older than most of you . </s>
And I remember 1956 when the voice of America spoke loudly the people Hungary and suggested they revolt . And I remembered what happened afterwards very well . I can say with pride that our organization had one of the two Americans in there covering it at the time . And I think that what happened at Budapest in Budapest , in Hungary would have been absolutely repeated if we encouraged Iranians . </s>
Can you take this to a question , sir . We encouraged Iranian rebels . Could you take it to a question , though ? Yes . Do you think it is more likely that the encouragement of Iranian rebels would have resulted in blood shed and with no progress or that we should have spoken loudly with no ability to protect them ? </s>
Well , I think that 's a fair question . Mort Zuckerman . I do n't know the answer . </s>
I do n't know if anybody knows the answer . I think one of the rationales for the restraint of the American administration was to have the Iranian government be able to divert the attention from those people who were at home objecting to their government and to their policies and blame it all on America . And we did n't want to be the lightning rod , so to speak , for the opposition which they would have brought forth against the people who were dissenting . I do n't know -- nobody will ever know what would have worked better . </s>
I do think that 's a fair argument to make . </s>
I do n't know the answer to that question . I actually -- can I -- as Mort said , it 's very difficult to prove as counterfactual , `` what would have happened if '' but we do know what actually happened , right ? The administration chose to be silent , and there was bloodshed in the streets of Tehran . And the dissident leaders we hope are the future leaders of Iran , were saying where is America ? </s>
That much we know . </s>
And we know the whole world watched that happen , where we looked impotent in the face of a major threat to the Iranian regime . We also know that the administration was saying at the time that if we stand back and are silent , this will make it easier for the Iranians to come to the negotiating table with us on a -- disarming their nuclear capability . </s>
That was an argument , that it 'll help them moderate because they wo n't feel under siege . </s>
They wo n't feel under pressure , and they 'll come to the table . </s>
Well , here we are , almost a year later , exactly , and the Iranians , as I said , just mastered 3,000 centrifuges . The IAEA is basically conceding that Iran is well on its way to having a nuclear weapon . And with that , and we 're running out of time . I want to let Wes respond . </s>
I want to let Wes respond to that , and then I want to do more one question . I think you have to be careful in foreign policy not to adopt a feel-good foreign policy . I agree . And one of the persistent elements of what we 're getting from our worthy opponents is a feel-good foreign policy . It 's like , you know , I 'm America . </s>
Stand up . This is what I believe . That 's all well and good , and it goes great in a rotary club where I come from . </s>
But when you 're actually trying to influence other nations , that kind of logic does n't work . That 's the logic that animated the last administration . It did n't work . </s>
We 're not going to repeat it . </s>
I have time for one more question . Yeah , in the white sweater . Yes ? The microphone is on its way to you . </s>
Thank you . Devon Cross . I just would be curious as to both sides , General Clark and Dan Senor , in the business of what America signals its intentions to be , the imposition of the deadline , the withdrawal in Afghanistan , how comfortable you would have been fighting under that and likewise the same for you , sir . As I understand the question , how comfortable am I that we 're going to start withdrawing in 2011 ? </s>
Well -- The question is how -- how comfortable you would have felt with a deadline in prosecuting a war against an enemy that was imposed by political -- </s>
Well , I would n't have been comfortable if we 'd put a 2011 deadline on getting out of it . I mean , you ca n't -- you 're dealing with a problem that has to be worked . It 's not a mechanical process with a machine . </s>
So there are other actors involved , there 're other intentions . In my view , most of Afghanistan is actually about Pakistan , and , therefore , we 've got to take the right actions not only in Afghanistan but also in Pakistan , and the Pakistani system , yes , ma'am , because this is Osama bin Laden in Pakistan , the Pakistani Taliban in Pakistan , and we can not put a large American force in there and do it directly ourselves . </s>
It 's a nation of 170 million people . </s>
It 's simply beyond the capacity of the armed forces . So somehow we have to use action at a distance , diplomacy , efforts in Pakistan are done by drones and intelligence agencies , and a lot of other effort . </s>
So that 's not amenable to a hard and fast deadline . I wish it were . But I 'm concerned about what 's going on in Iraq . I hope that what Bernard says is right . I know the policy makes sense . </s>
But these policies are incredibly difficult to execute . And so when Dan says he 's worried about it , I 'm worried about it , too . But , you know , I think our President has made the right decisions thus far . He 's shown strength , he 's shown resolve , he 's shown proper planning and a deliberate planning process , and we 've got to hope our men and women in uniform , and our diplomats , and our Congress will do the right thing to help do our part on this mission . And that concludes round two of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . </s>
So here 's where we are . We are about to hear brief closing statements by each of the debaters in turn . </s>
They will be two minutes each . </s>
And that is their last chance to change your minds before you vote for the second time . So to remind you of your vote on our motion when this debate began , the motion being `` Obama 's Foreign Policy Spells America 's Decline , '' before the debate began , 23 percent of you agreed with the motion , 45 percent of you disagreed , 32 percent were undecided and here to listen . And we will have you vote again in a few minutes after closing statements . And the team that has changed the most minds will be declared our winner just a few minutes from now . But first , round three , closing statements , and speaking first against the motion , Wesley Clark , retired Four Star General , former NATO Supreme Allied Commander , Europe , and Senior Fellow at UCLA 's Burkle Center . </s>
Well , I guess the first thing I would say is that the position -- the power position of a nation is dependent on not only its military , but its economic strength , and its political processes , its decision-making , and a whole host of factors . And Barack Obama took over a nation -- I 'm not going to label it decline , I 'm just going to say it was in a hole . </s>
And he 's tried to work very systematically to pull us up out of that hole , keeping us safe , dealing with other nations . He has n't accepted the old prejudices . </s>
He did not go to China and say , `` I wo n't talk to you unless you release two human rights activists right now , '' because the issues between the United States and China are not best dealt with in that kind of a public forum . </s>
He went to Europe and reassured our allies . He 's been very strong in the NATO summits . But he 's also tried to reach out to Medvedev in Russia . Maybe it wo n't work , but he 's done as much as he can to line up the strategy , he knows what the crucial decisions are that are coming . </s>
And every indication shows our President is a man of strong logic , strong convictions , and a man who does n't hesitate to make tough decisions when they 're necessary . He knows those decisions are coming in this administration , and when he makes them , I think you 'll see that America is a strong , capable , and respected nation . America -- our foreign policy under Barack Obama spelling America 's decline ? I do n't think so . I think you 're seeing America rebuilding itself , pulling itself up by the bootstraps to move forward into the 21st century . </s>
Thank you . Thank you , Mr. Clark . </s>
Our motion is `` Obama 's Foreign Policy Spells America 's Decline , '' and now summarizing his position against the motion , Dan Senor , Adjunct Senior Fellow of the Council of Foreign Relations . His new book on Israel 's economic miracle , `` Start-Up Nation , '' has just come out and I believe is on sale in the lobby . He 's a former Pentagon and White House advisor . Ladies and gentlemen , Dan Senor . You know , there was an interesting development about six , eight weeks ago after the administration caused a near rupture in the U.S./Israel relationship over an insult that the administration felt it had been subjected to by the Israeli government over the settlement issue in East Jerusalem . </s>
A week later , Secretary Clinton went to Moscow , and the purpose of that trip was to try and get the Russians to get on board on the Security Council for real sanctions against Iran . She arrived in Moscow and everyone knew that was the purpose of her trip , and upon her arrival , the foreign minister of Russia publicly announced that Russia was resuming its building of the nuclear plant in Bushehr , Iran . </s>
Welcome to Moscow , Madam Secretary . When a senior administration official was quoted in the Washington Post was asked , do you think that was an insult , he said absolutely not . </s>
Now anyone who believes that by the way shouldn’t be a senior administration official . But more importantly , it’s a metaphor for this administration’s realignment of its foreign policy , whether it’s in Latin America , whether it’s in the Arab world , whether it’s in Israel , whether it’s in eastern and Central Europe , we are sending a very consistent message and the leaders in that part of the world are no longer saying it quietly . </s>
They are saying it publicly that they feel that America is moving away from its historic commitments to those countries . As you’ve heard tonight , there’s not a single policymaker or government leader , as Bernard and General Clark said , there’s not a single policymaker or government leader that they can cite that is willing to stand with America today and expend real political capital to stand with America . There is -- there are no real concessions to point to for all this outreach we’ve done , for all the speeches that the President has given . As I’ve said before , personal biography is nice and it is moving to win over crowds around the world . It is not a substitute for a foreign policy , especially when your country is in decline . </s>
Thank you , Dan Senor . The motion : “Obama’s foreign policy spells America’s decline.” And summarizing his position against the motion , Bernard-Henri Levi , French philosopher and best-selling author . </s>
Bernard-Henri Lévy : Yes , to conclude , I think we are entering into a new world with new rules of the game , with new actors , and that means decline is possible . It is a possibility for America . But I believe that President Obama goes against , resists , this possible decline for the following reasons . </s>
Number One , he says bye-bye to this terrible illusion which was the neoconservative illusion that you could build democracy just like . This is a very important move . </s>
Number two , about human rights . I am a militant of human rights all my life , but I know also when you are the chief of the first superpower in the world , you must be accountable for every single word you express . You can not go to say to the Iranian people , “Go revolt , go in front of the tanks.” And then what ? </s>
Are you ready to support ? Are you ready to wage war or not ? Obama has the wisdom not to act this way . Number three , he acts with a very wise mix of strength and retention of strength : fire and holding the fire . He never said that he was against the military option in , for example , the Iranian situation , but he opens the game . </s>
And this is what foreign policy is . And at the end , I must say that since a few -- since two years , it is more easy all over the world to be a friend of America . You can be proud today to be a friend of America , which was not the case three , four , five , or eight years ago . </s>
I’m sorry to say that . Thank you . Thank you , Bernard-Henri Lévy . The motion : “Obama’s foreign policy spells America’s decline.” And finally summarizing his position in support of this motion , Mort Zuckerman , chairman and editor in chief of U.S. News and World Report and publisher of the New York Daily News . </s>
The reference was made to the economy and to the economic condition of the United States , which I think is a critical part of everything that we’re talking about . We never got a chance in terms of time to do that , but if there is one area where in my judgment we have made huge errors that are going to compound the macroeconomic problems of the United States is in fact the way we have responded to the economic crisis . That in fairness to the extent Obama inherited , but in my judgment the policies he adopted were simply inadequate to the problem , they were wrongly focused . There is n't a country in the world that does n't understand how serious the problems are for the United States and its economy . And if there is one area where we had a huge reach around the world , it was in the area of the economy . </s>
And that , I will suggest to you is the area where this administration has failed the most . And by the way , the people who know it most clearly are the American people . </s>
And that 's why his support has dropped so dramatically . So without going into that in any more detail because there 's no time , I think that it contributes mightily to the conclusions that we would urge you to have . Thank you , Mort Zuckerman . </s>
And that concludes our closing statements . And now it 's time to learn which side has argued best . We 're going to ask you again to go to the key pads at your seat and to register your vote now . Our motion is `` Obama 's foreign policy spells America 's decline . '' If you now agree with this side arguing for this motion , Dan Senor and Mort Zuckerman , push number one . </s>
If you disagree with the motion , Bernard- Henri Lévy and Wesley Clark , push number two . And if you remain or became undecided , push number three . And we 're going to have the results actually just in a couple of minutes . It takes an instant to get these in . </s>
So before that , I just want to chat about a couple of things . First of all , as I said at the beginning of the evening , this is the end of our fourth season . And we gave a round of applause to Robert Rosenkranz for making all this possible . I also -- somebody else who absolutely needs to be thanked for making these things happen month after month is the executive producer and her rather spare team of support who put this thing together . </s>
It 's very , very much more difficult than it would look , not just the care and feeding of all of those people on the stage but the hall , the public -- the publicity , all of it . </s>
She does everything but upholster the seats that you 're sitting on . So Dana Wolfe , if you 'll stand up , it 's time to take some credit . And finally , in light of tonight 's debate , I just think it was one of the most intelligent and high level that we 've had . I want to thank all of our panelists for this . A special thanks goes to our venue , Skirball , and our partners , NPR , Bloomberg Television , Newsweek and everyone who has supported this fourth series of debates . </s>

Thank you from me , John Donvan and Intelligence Squared US . </s>
All right , ladies and gentlemen , we 're going to begin , and I want to ask you to welcome our debaters to the stage . And now I 'd like to introduce the chairman of the board of Intelligence Squared U.S. , Mr. Robert Rosenkranz . </s>
Well , thank you all very much for being here , and I want to just start by thanking Aspen Institute , especially Kitty Boone and Walter Isaacson for inviting Intelligence Squared to participate in the Ideas Festival . We 've been broadcasting these debates monthly on National Public Radio for six years , mostly from New York , with occasional debates in D.C. and Chicago , and it 's very special for us to be here in Aspen . We believe that debate remains one of the best vehicles we have , not only for promulgating ideas , but for testing those ideas with rigor . </s>
And we enjoy proving that debate is not a lost art . </s>
We think you 'll find it special to see how debate can raise the level of public discourse in an engaging and competitive format . </s>
My role this evening is to frame the debate . `` Why is this subject important ? What are the principal arguments on each side ? '' Hydraulic fracturing , or fracking , is used to extract natural gas locked up in shale rock . The process involves pumping millions of gallons of water and tons of chemicals under very high pressure into rock formations nearly two miles under the Earth 's surface . </s>
The environmental concerns are obvious . </s>
Accidents can happen anywhere along the line , especially during pumping operations or in disposing of wastes . </s>
Aquifers can be contaminated by methane and fracking fluids . Some highly toxic chemicals might percolate into groundwater . </s>
Large quantities of methane , a powerful greenhouse gas , might be emitted . There 's even concern that fracking might induce earthquakes . Would you trust the oil industry to take proper precautions ? </s>
How can they justify taking these kind of environmental risks ? </s>
Well , what are the counterarguments ? Put simply , cheap and abundant natural gas is Viagra for the limp U.S. economy . Shale already provides nearly a quarter of our natural gas . </s>
It 's projected to support 870,000 jobs by 2015 . By reducing electric bills , it will put more than $ 900 a year in the pockets of the average household . </s>
The geopolitical benefits are equally dramatic . By reducing oil imports and pressuring oil prices down , we reduce the power and leverage of such oil exporting troublemakers , as Venezuela and Russia , Saudi Arabia and Iran . There 's also a strong environmental argument in favor . The real world choice is burning gas and burning coal . Per unit of energy , coal creates twice the carbon emissions as gas does . </s>
The U.S. has reduced its carbon emissions far more than Europe has done , and natural gas is the reason . Tonight 's debate is about the inevitable trade-offs between risks and rewards . Clearly , the risks are real and it is reasonable to be concerned about them . But the benefits are real , too . Which argument should prevail ? </s>
It 's up to you to decide . </s>
And to help you do that , we 've assembled an outstanding panel of experts . It 's now my privilege to turn the evening over to them and to our moderator , John Donvan . Thank you , Robert . Thank you . And I 'd just like to invite one more round of applause for Robert Rosenkranz , and for the American Clean Skies Foundation for underwriting this event , and for the Aspen Institute . </s>
For all of them , a round of applause . Thank you . </s>
So , what if you could take a volcano and turn it upside down so that instead of that huge explosion going up into the sky , it goes down into the earth , and once it 's down there , it releases this huge ocean of energy that could heat our homes for decades to come ? Would n't that be great ? Or would it ? I 'm John Donvan of Intelligence Squared U.S. Get ready for a debate -- not on the upside-down volcano -- because it is a metaphor , a flawed one . It does not exist -- but on the principle of technologies that works in a similar way . </s>
It is called “fracking.” </s>
And it is a debate because fracking actually is getting at an enormous amount of natural gas energy that this nation does need . </s>
But at the same time , it is feared that fracking could be having enormous and terrible toxic consequences , destructive to the environment and destructive to the communities . We have four superbly qualified debaters -- two against two -- who will be arguing for and against this specific motion -- No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good . Our debate will go in three rounds . </s>
Then , the audience votes to choose the winner . And only one side wins . On the side arguing for the motion : Deborah Goldberg , a managing attorney with the environmental law firm Earthjustice . Her partner is Katherine Hudson . She is the Watershed Program director of Riverkeeper , a clean water advocacy group based in New York . </s>
On the side against , Joe Nocera . He is an award-winning journalist and op-ed columnist for “The New York Times.” </s>
And his partner , Susan Tierney , a former assistant secretary for policy in the U.S. Department of Energy . I 'm now going to re-introduce everyone , because what we just did was for our television broadcast . Now , we 're going to do a little bit for our radio podcast . </s>
And I appreciate the applause . It 's very , very good for our transitions , so thank you . And if you do n't applaud at one point , I 'll raise my hand . That 's me saying , “Please applaud again.” Our motion is -- No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good . </s>
Let 's meet our debators and welcome first Deborah Goldberg . Deborah is a managing attorney at Earthjustice , the world 's first and largest non-profit environmental law firm . Deborah , you 've worn many different hats . But now that you 're in this field , I understand the way you came through -- it had something to do with birds . </s>
That 's right . My love for birds is what woke me up to the risks that climate change poses for bio-diversity . And I got involved in fracking because we’re not going to be able to deal with climate change unless we end our addiction to fossil fuels . All right . Thank you very much . </s>
Your partner is Katherine Hudson . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Katherine Hudson . Katherine , you are an avid outdoors woman . You ski , you rock-climb , you sail on the Hudson River . You spent nearly 25 years in New York State government , working in the Environmental Protection Bureau of the Attorney General 's Office and also the Departmental of Environmental Conservation . </s>
So , it sounds like you 've been in this all of your life . But at one time , you were actually a probation officer ? That 's right . </s>
It was a bit of an unusual start for me . But I found myself working as a probation officer in New Brunswick , New Jersey . And it is actually what pushed me to go to law school , because I realized that I wanted to be part of the system -- I thought I could make a difference if I was -- and not on the receiving end of the system . </s>
Thank you very much , Kate Hudson . Our motion is No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Movement is Doing More Harm Than Good , and here is , arguing against the motion first , Joe Nocera . Joe , you are an award-winning journalist working for the New York Times now with the Op-Ed page after writing for them for a long time . In April of 2011 , you went to the Op- Ed page and since then some of your columns on energy have brought down fire upon your head . </s>
You 've been referred to by climate progress as a member of the climate ignorati . </s>
Yes I have . You 've been denounced by Robert Redford . Yes I have . So , did you see all of this coming your way when you took this stance ? You know , when I first started writing about energy issues in the Op-Ed page I was surprised -- I was not surprised that people were disagreeing with me . </s>
I kind of expected that . But I was surprised by the vehemence of it . The only time I 've ever been accosted in a grocery store for a column I wrote was after one of my fracking columns . All right . </s>
We 'll see what happens here tonight . Let 's meet your partner . Also arguing that the natural gas boom has been a good thing for the country is Susan Tierney . She is the managing principal at Analysis Group , where she consults on energy , economics , and environmental issues . </s>
She has been in government for the State of Massachusetts and was also an assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Energy during the Clinton Administration , and you -- interesting thing , you were an art history major . </s>
Yes . So are the art historians doomed if they 're all going into energy ? Or do you still believe ? What it means is that I was a pretty mediocre artist and so then I thought well , art history , that 's kind of right , and then I was a pretty mediocre art historian , so I did whatever anybody in that circumstance would do . </s>
I became a policy wonk . </s>
I hear from your brother you 're a good debater . Only because we did it around the breakfast table . </s>
All right . We 'll find out more . </s>
So , our motion is this . No fracking way . </s>
The natural gas boom is doing more harm than good . </s>
You our live audience will choose our winners by voting on that motion , both before the debate , and once again when the debate is completed . So let 's go to the first vote . There 's a keypad at your seat on the right-hand side . This is a tricky motion because if you 're for the motion you 're against fracking and I want that to be clear to you . You 've heard where they 're coming from . </s>
If you 're for this side , if you 're for this side , if you 're for the motion , no fracking way , press number one . If you are with this side , against no fracking way , it means you support fracking , push number two . If you 're undecided , push number three . And if you made a mistake just correct it . The system will lock in your last vote . </s>
And what we 'll do is we 're going to hold that result for you . </s>
Does the buzz buzz mean that you 're confused ? Are there any questions ? No ? Everybody 's good ? Okay . </s>
So what we 're going to do at the end of the debate , we 'll reveal both of the numbers and the team whose numbers have changed the most in the course of the evening will be declared our winner . So , onto round one . Our motion is No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good and here to speak first for the motion , Kate Hudson . She spent nearly 25 years in New York State government serving in the Attorney General 's office and in the Department of Environmental Conservation . She is now the watershed program director at Riverkeeper , a member-supported clean water advocacy group . </s>
Ladies and gentleman , Kate Hudson . The motion before us tonight is No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good . Yes , the gas boom is doing more harm than good , but why ? What is going on ? Simply , the gas companies are rushing forward in the face of too many unknowns and too little control . </s>
In essence , these companies are engaged in an uncontrolled experiment , which is resulting in extreme and , in some cases , permanent harm to people , communities , and the environment that can not be compensated for by any possible benefits . What my partner , Deborah Goldberg , and I will be talking with you about tonight is what those harms are that are being faced across the country because of the natural gas boom : the health risks for individuals , the impacts to the environment , and the costs for local communities . And why , in the face of the unknown , in the face of the harms , gas companies are so intent on rushing forward hoping to figure it out along the way . Well , what exactly is fracking ? </s>
Deborah and I use the term fracking to refer to the entire cradle-to-grave process of natural gas extraction , from site preparation through transmission to end uses . The process begins with cutting access roads through the existing landscape and stripping a site about the size of five football fields to serve as a multi-well pad . Then the drilling rig will arrive , along with thousands of truckloads of equipment , water , sand , and chemicals that will be used to drill thousands of feet into the ground and miles horizontally . This is followed by the actual fracturing of the well which involves repeatedly , for a month or more , forcing two to eight million gallons of water and hundreds of undisclosed chemicals underground , under pressure , to fracture the rock , allowing the gas to escape . Then something must be done with the large quantity of contaminated wastewater , up to several million gallons per well , that will come back up along with the methane now released from the shale . </s>
If not properly handled , the methane may find its way into nearby drinking water wells . It may also be released into the air either intentionally or as a result of leaks . The methane gas that is captured is then processed and forced through gathering lines and into high pressure pipelines that will need to be constructed from numerous wellheads for hundreds and thousands of miles to the place where the gas will be burned , permanently carving up the landscape and communities that lie in between . </s>
To give you a clearer idea of how this fracking process is impacting people and communities , imagine that you 'd go home tonight and find out that your next-door neighbor has signed a lease with a gas drilling company without asking you . What can you expect from this industrial activity going on next door ? Even though you did n't choose to lease , you will be exposed to the same risks of contamination to the water you drink and the air you breathe as your neighbor . You will be subject to the same threat of leaks and spills of the fracking wastewater , which contain known carcinogens and radioactive material . </s>
Fracking-related spills occur on average once every three days in Colorado . Moreover , the industry has no safe disposal plans for this waste . Much of it is currently injected into underground wells , but this practice has been linked to earthquakes , and there 's growing evidence that these wells are leaking . </s>
The gas well itself , and associated processing compression in storage tanks , will leak toxic and smog- forming air pollutants . The once pristine air in fracked parts of Wyoming is now worse than the air in Los Angeles because of this . The few studies we do have show increased risks of cancer and respiratory diseases in gas land communities linked to these releases . Like your leasing neighbor , you will be unable to escape noise that can sound -- the constant day and night truck traffic , estimated by New York State at 4,000 truck trips per well . </s>
There will be 24/7 noise that can sound like a jet engine , and glaring lights all night long during the drilling and fracturing of the well over the next month or more . You will also potentially have gas pipelines cross your property whether you agree to it or not , and you will be subject to the same increase in your taxes as your drilling neighbor when your town has to repair the road damage caused by the heavy truck traffic that comes with fracking that will tear apart your rural and suburban streets , and when your town has to meet the increased demands for community services from transient drill crews . </s>
Proponents argue that the economic benefits outweigh these risks so far . But what are the supposed benefits of this industrial activity almost literally in your backyard , or down the street from your children 's pool ? The economic benefits for you will be limited . There will be access to cheap natural gas at least for a little while , but it wo n't last for very long because the amount that can be forced out of the earth is limited and will run out . </s>
But even more important , it will not remain cheap , because the industry will be doing everything it can to increase the price of gas , including exporting America 's gas to other countries where they can triple -- yes , triple the price -- on the U.S. market today . The drilling will bring jobs , at least while the drill rigs are in town , but not very many and not for long , and these gas industry jobs are some of the most life- threatening in the country . Oil and gas workers are seven times more likely to die on the job than the national average . And fracking can destroy businesses that could sustain local economies into the future after the fracking boom is over , like agriculture , recreation , and tourism . What is clear is that gas companies are not willing to wait . </s>
The natural gas boom is moving forward as a large uncontrolled experiment with every individual , family , and community who has not signed a lease being forced to participate without their consent . Whatever transitory benefits fracking may provide is outweighed by all of the harms that it currently brings . But even more important , there are some harms that simply can not be compensated for . If you can no longer live in your home or continue to work your family farm , if you lose your health , the health of your child , if you lose your life as hundreds of oil and gas workers have . If you lose access to drinkable water or breathable air as individuals in communities across the fracking states have , there is no good that can outweigh such harm . </s>
Until we have a much better understanding of the processes and the true risks , until there are mandatory rules in place to control these risks and eliminate the extreme harm , and until the industry actually follows those rules , the only defensible course of action is a cautious one . The only reasonable and fair answer is , `` No , no fracking way . '' </s>
Thank you , Kate Hudson . Our motion is No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good , and now here to speak against the motion is Joe Nocera , he is an op-ed columnist for the New York Times and a regular business commentator on NPR 's `` Weekend Edition Saturday , '' an award winning journalist , and a bestselling author . </s>
Ladies and gentlemen , Joe Nocera . </s>
Thank you . </s>
In Kate 's opening statement , there 's one word that she did n't use , and that word is `` coal . '' We 're going to use that word a lot on our side of the ledger tonight , because part of the case for natural gas is it 's the best single way to diminish our use of coal . </s>
And coal is without question the most environmentally hazardous fuel that we have in America . You know , Fred Krupp from the Environmental Defense Fund was in Aspen not very long ago , and he did a panel on fracking , and he said , you know , `` I 'm a realist . I 'm also an environmentalist . Fracking is here , and we have to regulate it.” </s>
It 's not that impossible . We regulate banks . We regulate children 's toys . We regulate automobiles . We do regulate banks , actually . </s>
But when it comes to gas , we are in the golden age of gas , that 's what we 're in . </s>
It 's not like we have a little bit of gas that we 're busy trying to extract here and there , and it 's going to run out tomorrow . We have something on the order of 2,000 trillion cubic feet of gas . </s>
We use about 24 trillion cubic feet a year . So , we have about an 80 to 100-year supply right now . That means , among other things , that gas is incredibly cheap . Right now it 's in the two-dollar range . </s>
It probably -- yes , it probably will go up to the four or five-dollar range , which still makes it much cheaper than most other fuels and makes it very competitive with coal . Gas has -- cheap energy is an enormous boon for the country , just cheap energy across the board . It increases our GDP . It has enormous ramifications well beyond jobs . </s>
Natural gas also has the ability to be a transformative fuel and a bridge fuel as we think about moving to renewal . Excuse me , one second . So the economic benefit is one kind of benefit . A second kind of benefit obviously is the energy security benefit . </s>
I 'm going to read something from the Wall Street Journal that ran just a few days ago . `` America will halve its reliance on Middle East oil by the end of this decade and could be completely rid of it by 2035 due to the declining demand and the rapid growth of new petroleum sources in the western hemisphere . Shale rock is one of those sources . '' Now , who made this projection ? </s>
It was OPEC itself . Think about a world where you do n't have to worry about cartels , you do n't have to worry about being dependent on our enemies for oil , a world where foreign policy is not dictated by our need for oil . </s>
The ability of the United States to have its own resource once again in a way that we never thought we were going to is a tremendous gift that 's been handed to us , and fracking is the way that we 're taking advantage of it . Now , the third aspect that I want to talk about is the environmental benefits , which is real and which is happening now . As recently as 2009 , 45 percent of the power generation in the country was coal , 23 percent was natural gas . Today , it 's about evenly split . There is a rush to natural gas and away from coal . </s>
This is a great thing for the country . Natural gas has half the CO2 emissions than coal , 90 -- coal has 90 times more sulfur dioxide , five times more nitrogen oxide . Coal is the dirtiest fuel we have . </s>
And so , if facilities could switch to natural gas , it has the potential to transform the country . You know , in Europe , where they like to think of themselves as extremely environmentally sensitive , their emissions are actually going up because they 're building more coal fire power plants . In America , our emissions are flat and going slightly down , according to studies . And a large part of the reason is because we 're having this rush to natural gas . </s>
The same is also true of China , of Mexico , of Russia , and of a handful of other countries that are relying on other sources than gas . We have -- what we actually have is a minute and 31 seconds . </s>
You 're going to get 20 seconds more for the water drink . Oh , I am ? Yes , Joe.. Go give him the water . It 's clean water . I have actually made my case . </s>
You 're good ? I 'm good . All right . I do n't need seven minutes . </s>
Drink water . Thank you . </s>
Joe Nocera . So , a reminder of what 's going on . We are halfway through the opening round of this Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate . I am John Donvan . We have four debaters -- two against two -- fighting it out against this motion : No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Movement is Doing More Harm Than Good . </s>
You have heard from the first two debaters . </s>
Now , onto the third . Deborah Goldberg is a managing attorney at Earthjustice , an environmental law firm that provides legal representation at no cost to more than a thousand clients , ranging from large national groups like the National Resources Defense Council , to small community coalitions . Ladies and gentlemen , Deborah Goldberg . To start , I 'd like to bring the focus back to the motion that we 've been asked to debate . We are n't here tonight to decide whether or not fracking is a gift or if it 's a Trojan Horse . </s>
We are here to decide whether or not the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good . So , what characterizes a boom ? It 's big . It 's sudden . </s>
And it blows a lot of smoke . And the natural gas boom is doing all of that to an extreme . It 's too much . It 's too fast . And the hype is just over the top . </s>
So , why do I say that it 's too much ? The most serious health and environmental impacts of fracking are largely due to very intensive gas development . </s>
We have 500,000 gas wells in this country , nearly 3,000 in one county , 11 compressor stations belching carcinogenic air emissions in a tiny town of only two square miles . Our bodies and our ecosystems can absorb a certain amount of abuse and still bounce back . But at a certain point , it 's just too much , and the insults overwhelm the resilience . </s>
Take Pennsylvania , for example . In the beginning , Pennsylvania was letting the frackers take their wastewater , which is contaminated with very high levels of salt , to sewage treatment plants , where it was diluted with the sewage , and then discharged into rivers and streams . </s>
In short order we had a water quality violation in the drinking water supply for 350,000 people . And what 's more , Pennsylvania realized that if they continued to let the frackers take that amount of wastage through its treatment plants , they would salinate every freshwater stream in the state in a period of two years . The same dynamic operates on a global level . Our atmosphere can absorb a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions . </s>
But if we release too much , the climate warms to a point of catastrophic change . And the natural gas boom is taking us to that tipping point , because the way that fracking is done now releases very large amounts of methane into the air . </s>
And methane is a very potent greenhouse gas , almost 72 times as potent as carbon dioxide , depending on the time frame that you look at . A recent study showed that the leakage from fracking is about four percent of production and the scientists recognized that at that level gas loses its entire climate advantage over coal when it 's burned for electrical power . The intensive development is n't really even good for the industry . Right now the industry is losing money on every dry gas well that 's drilled . But it 's even worse for solar , wind , and other clean energy sources , because they are displaced when the price of natural gas drops so low . </s>
The boom is not only too big , but it 's way too fast . </s>
It is out ahead of the science . We do know as a result of lots of public pressure that some of the chemicals that are used in this process are toxic , but there are many chemicals that have never even been tested as to their toxicity , and we have no clue what they 're going to do to our health or environment , in the short or the long term . We do n't know where the wastewater that stays down below -- and that can be as much as 90 percent of the waste water in the northeastern shale -- is going to migrate in 20 , 30 years or more . The development is also way ahead of the protections that we have . Instead of doing science and getting the safeguards before we move forward , we are flooring the accelerator and we 're responding to crises . </s>
When you move too fast you cut corners and you have accidents , and that 's particularly troublesome when you 're talking about climate change , because the single most important factor for the social and environmental impact of climate change is the speed at which it progresses . We move too fast with climate change and we do n't have time to prepare or to adapt , and so the climate scientists are telling us that we have to address the most potent greenhouse gases right now as fast as we can , and on that list is methane . The hype and the hoopla is clouding our vision and making it impossible for us to hear the facts . There are hundreds of millions of dollars being spent to ensure that this industry can continue to operate without the science and without the protections we need . </s>
$ 320 million spent on lobbying the federal government in just two years . As a result , what we are hearing now is not how we 're going to end our addiction to fossil fuels , but instead , a hundred years of gas . </s>
Now , a hundred years of gas is based on extracting every molecule of gas from all of our reserves , even those that we have n't actually discovered yet , when it is well known that only about 10 percent of those reserves tend to be economically feasible to develop . And if we switch our power plants over to gas and our transportation systems over to gas , and our heating and cooking systems , and then on top of that we export liquid natural gas to other countries , how long is that abundant resource going to last ? And at what price to our health and environment ? The boom mentality produces magical thinking . </s>
The idea that this industry is going voluntarily to abide by a golden rule or a golden age of gas is just a fairy tale . This industry fights every protection we try to put in place , federal and state , often when it 's even in its economic interests to comply . What all this means is that we are in the middle of an uncontrolled experiment . If we get this wrong , there is no turning back . And so we need to take the opportunity now when , we have a glut and we are not desperate for gas , to do the science and get the protections in place before it 's too late and the natural gas boom that looks so exciting now goes bust in the face of the next generation . </s>
Thank you , Deborah Goldberg . Our motion is No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good . </s>
And now our final debater speaking against this motion , Sue Tierney . Sue is a managing principal at Analysis Group , where she consults to businesses , government agencies , nongovernment organizations . She 's a former assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Energy , and is a current member of the Secretary of Energy 's Advisory Board . Ladies and gentleman , Sue Tierney . </s>
Good evening , everybody . Joe told you about the upsides of the natural gas boom , and Deborah and Kate told you about some of the risks . I just want to start by saying if it were only as simple as my opponents tell you , then life would be pretty easy . </s>
Let me tell you why their position , that the costs of developing natural gas are simply not worth the benefits , is wrong . First , what they did n't tell you is that there is absolutely nobody in the United States , no entity , that could actually introduce this proposition and make it so . </s>
There are hundreds of millions of decision makers in our energy system . </s>
If we rely on a regulated market , consumers and suppliers all around the country , every one of you is making energy choices every day , they do n't have the authority to completely stop this , no single state could stop this , nor could the federal government . On the consumer side , Americans tend not to think very much about energy . </s>
What they think about is getting to their job or getting to the shop where they hope to find lots of options , whether they can power their computers , or keep their homes warm or cool , and it 's those realities that people do n't think about energy that much . That makes this a really hard issue to deal with . Everybody wants energy 24/7 . </s>
They want it pretty cheap . Many say they 'd like it to be clean , and many really suffer when prices go up . </s>
That 's the reality , and that makes this issue very gray and not as black and white as my opponents would tell you . Deborah and Kate have set up in some sense a false dichotomy . They make it seem as though natural gas is evil and so everything else is pure . </s>
We know that that 's not the case . Surely we should be developing more wind and solar power . </s>
I 'm sure everyone in this audience agrees with that . Right now , seven percent of America 's energy supply comes from renewable energy ; most of that is from the Roosevelt-era hydroelectric facilities , those gigantic projects , none of which we would be able to build again for environmental impact reasons . </s>
The other major portion of renewables right now comes from biofuels such as ethanol , with its own problems from an environmental impact point of view . Wind and solar are expected to grow , but even if they 're 10 times as much as they are today , we 're still talking about a long way to go and a small portion of the supply , and I hope we get there . It 's very hard . But these and every other energy choice are really pretty hard and very complicated . </s>
Why else would Japan be restarting its nuclear plants so soon after the Fukushima disaster ? </s>
It 's because they need energy . Why else would Pennsylvania be opening up its shale gas resources for development ? They 'd like some jobs and economic benefits associated with it . </s>
And , in fact , why are coal states fighting so hard against the U.S. EPA Air Toxics Rules that would reduce the amount of coal burning in coal fired power plants ? Surely the coal industry has something to do with that , but also there are a lot of jobs in that state tied to coal . </s>
So what has clean cheap gas provided for us in this pretty gray landscape so far ? Joe told you about how natural gas is taking market share from coal in the power sector right now . In 2012 alone , Southern Company , which is one of the biggest owners of a coal fired power plant fleet in the country , expects to generate almost half of its power from natural gas . That 's three times the amount from gas as it was five years ago . </s>
And this is astonishing . Coal has dropped from 70 percent of its fleet to 30 percent of its fleet -- of power generation . Now , certainly in a compartmentalized way , Americans often get really agitated about energy choices , but it 's usually when it hits their backyard , as Kate and Deborah have told you . Unfortunately , every form of energy is in somebody 's backyard . Many communities are split about shale gas . </s>
Absolutely that 's true . Of course , some communities are split when they think that there 's going to be a Wal-Mart coming because it affects the quality and tenor of their life in those areas . But think about it , every type of energy facility that you can think of has split communities , whether it 's a wind farm in Cape Cod , the power lines across the Midwest to tie the America 's Saudi Arabia of wind to the people using wind in other parts of the country , nuclear plants , the case for shutting down existing coal plants , splits communities apart . These splits typically come down to jobs versus the environment , and that 's surely the case here . Where I do agree with Kate and Deborah is that shale gas development does have important environmental and community impact . </s>
Should we regulate natural gas development more ? Absolutely we should . Is regulation improving ? Absolutely it is . </s>
Colorado and Pennsylvania are the prime cases for advancements that are leapfrogging for best practices . The federal government is , too . Should we drop the so-called Halliburton loophole , which exempts water injections associated with hydraulic fracturing from the Safe Drinking Water Act ? </s>
Why not ? Wouldn’t that provide a lot of more public trust than we have right now ? Should we tighten up emissions of methane from the whole process ? Absolutely we should . But do we think that the United States should take shale gas off the table ? </s>
No . That 's unrealistic . It 's not even sensible . </s>
If we somehow -- someone in the United States could decide to do that , because it did more harm then good , what would we get ? We 'd probably get a little bit more renewables , maybe a little faster . </s>
We would get a lot more coal use , and we 'd have mountaintop mining , we 'd have coal ash piles , some of which have recently spilled into rivers , we 'd have much higher CO2 emissions that contribute to global warming , and we 'd have unhealthy levels of mercury emissions and other toxic chemicals . There 's a solution to all of these issues . There are best practices . There should be much more aggressive attention to this . What I really wish is that people would stop demonizing this fuel , because it makes it impossible to find sensible solutions in the middle . </s>
There are sensible solutions in the middle . We should be working on enabling those to develop over time . </s>
Our main argument is that the two principal sources of energy in the United States , coal and oil , are much more damaging to the environment than is natural gas , and that 's for the communities where those are used as well as to the nation as a whole . Sue Tierney , your time is up . Thank you very much . Thank you . </s>
Thank you . And that concludes round one of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate where the motion being argued is No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good . Now we go on to round two , where the debaters address each other directly and take questions from me and from you in the audience . </s>
We have two teams of two members each here arguing against this motion . </s>
Team arguing against fracking , the team that says essentially , `` No fracking way , '' Katherine Hudson and Deborah Goldberg , we have heard them say that getting the price -- the price to be paid for getting the gas out of the ground is just too high , that it is an environmental threat , that it will ruin communities , that it is more expensive than it seems , that , in fact , the harms will outweigh the benefits that were laid out by the other sides . And they 're basically saying that the boom is getting ahead of science , that we do n't know what we 're getting into . The other side , Sue Tierney and Joe Nocera , the defenders of fracking , the enthusiasts , are saying , `` Yes , there are risks involved , but they 're manageable . Regulations can be put into place . '' They compare it to coal . </s>
Against coal , natural gas they say looks pretty clean , that if you look at this thing as the national security matter , as a jumpstart to an economy that needs it , that having this stuff underground and being able to get at it is an enormous gift that 's dropped into our laps . So we 're going to go through some of that now and explore some of what they were talking about in the debate . And I want to go first to the side that 's arguing to -- the supporters of fracking . Your opponents have made this statement that the boom is getting ahead of science and implicitly saying , `` Until we know a lot more , particularly on the environmental issue , the impact , we should slow down to stop . '' And you 're saying the opposite . </s>
So take on the science issue and the not knowing and whether that is a signal to stop , either one of you , Joe or -- </s>
Well , first of all , I think we do know a lot . </s>
In any kind of boom , it is correct . Industry goes in , and the environmentalists have done a great favor to the country because they 've gotten on top of the fracking issues early -- but we do know that there 's methane leakage , and there 's science going on right now to figure out what that leakage is and how to make the well casings better . And that 's one of a dozen examples where the issue of the chemicals -- you can go to websites now and see some of the -- most -- all of the chemicals . Certain states have passed laws that demand that the chemicals be revealed . So , what 's basically been happening over the last four or five years , you have cases like in New York State -- which stopped fracking until they could study it . </s>
And now they 're getting ready to open it up in a small way , in a safe way . It can be done . </s>
All right . Deborah Goldberg , you’re opponents say we do know a lot about science . Well , let me be very clear either right from the start that neither of us have argued that it should stop right now . What we have argued is that the boom is the problem , that it 's going much too fast , and it 's outstripping both the science and the protections . So , we think that what -- for example , what New York has done , makes a great deal of sense , is stop for a while , when it 's not necessary , we have a glut coming from other places -- and take a look at what the impacts are -- and figure out what needs to be done . </s>
But to Joe Nocera 's point , where he says , actually , we -- refuting you and saying that we actually do know a good amount now , can you take that on ? </s>
Well , we learned , we have learned more recently . But the fact of the matter is , there 's a great deal that we do n't know . And the reason that we do n't know that is that the industry has done everything in its power to keep us from getting the data that we need in order to really do the study . So , for example , I just submitted a Freedom of Information request to New York State Department of Environmental Conservation , asking them for the results of water quality studies that they had done in connection with oil and gas development in the state . And what they told me was , “We do n't have any . </s>
We do n't ask for that.” So , how are you going to do serious science if you do n't have a baseline test of the conditions ? </s>
And additional studies during operation ? And follow-up afterwards ? You know , we are learning something because of public pressure , but there 's a long way to go . All right , Susan . </s>
John , yeah . </s>
I 'd like to weigh in on this one . One of the things that the debate about what we know about the science focuses on is the question of how much methane emissions are leaking from the entire life cycle , from the production well all the way to the consumers ' burner tip . And we actually -- there 's a great deal that we know about that . We do n't know everything . We should know a whole lot more . </s>
Deborah pointed out -- </s>
So , what -- what does that mean , then ? Is Deborah right ? </s>
We lack -- We should know a whole lot more , is that we should slow things down until we know a whole lot more ? No . We should not slow things down , but we should absolutely insist on better measurements . We should measure what is a baseline for conditions prior to drilling -- </s>
So , why not slow things down more ? If you 're conceding that more work actually needs to be done , why not pause ? What 's the harm in pausing ? There are a number of different harms . </s>
One of them is the multi-billion dollar contribution that lower natural gas prices have provided for the United States economy . Another reason is the development of chemical jobs and industries that are coming back to the United States because natural gas is a feedstock that 's supportable . </s>
The greenhouse gas emissions that have been reduced in the last three years because of -- when you take aside and account for the effects of the economy having crashed , there are much lower greenhouse gas emissions . All right . </s>
So , Kate Hudson , your opponent 's saying that the benefits train has left the station . The good stuff is happening and to slow down the program would cause those -- those list of harms she just went through . </s>
I think that the benefits that have just been recited are questionable . For instance , luring the petrochemical industry back into this country , is that really what we want ? Or should n't we instead be trying to move towards a green economic future for our children , rather than having -- -- a fossil-fuel based industry come back ? </s>
Joe Nocera ? Well , it 's a big country . We need lots of different kinds of jobs . Of course we need green jobs . </s>
We need other kinds of jobs , too . Are you in mid-sentence or -- I 'm speechless . Because of the -- -- so , go ahead , Kate . No , I want to actually go to the subject of jobs , because one of the characteristics of the extraction industry is the boom and bust . </s>
And what is happening already is that there is -- when the rigs come into town , there are lots of jobs that come up . Truck drivers , they need a lot of truck drivers . </s>
They frack the wells and they leave . And then the economy busts . </s>
And the record is that those economies are in worse shape than before the extraction industry came into town . Sue Tierney . </s>
What our opponents are saying is that when we look at a microscope about the impacts on localities , there are -- there are -- there are tremendous challenges that 's going on in those communities . </s>
I do n't think Joe or I would say that that 's not the case . But every person in this audience drives a car , whether it 's a Prius or something else , and there is extraction going on for getting that oil somewhere . Coal mining is all over the country and Colorado is an example of a state where they 've said the environmental benefit of a natural gas fired fleet of power plants outweigh the risks and the harm . So there are tradeoffs and compensations across these areas . </s>
The wind farms , you want to talk about disrupting areas -- by the way , I 'm a huge fan of wind farms . I 'm in favor of wind . I 'm probably one of the few people who is very eager to say that , but as a result of that there are lots of community impacts in a variety of different places that people are talking about . </s>
I have a question for the side that 's arguing against fracking . I 'm just interested in clarity on the positions you have staked out and it does n't -- you do n't necessarily have to be agreeing with each other , but I feel as though you 're not necessarily , because Kate Hudson is saying having the petro chemical industry retake root here , particularly in new parts of the country , is not a very attractive idea . </s>
At the same time , Deborah , you 're saying well , we 're not against fracking , we just want fracking to be good , to work beneficially and without harm . So , is this team against fracking , against the petro chemical industry , you know , working here ? Or is it not ? </s>
I think that we are not saying stop everything all at once and I do n't think Kate is saying that either . </s>
We know that we need some natural gas , probably to keep the lights on for a while . </s>
The really big problem is that the focus on this industry and the power and wealth of this industry is actually derailing the attempts that we have been making in the past to put a price on carbon , for example , to move ourselves to an energy -- an economy that would actually be sustainable in the future . So , neither of us are saying that there are n't advantages in some situations between putting in a gas plant , say , instead of a coal plant , if we really knew what the lifecycle methane emissions were . And both of our opponents have admitted that we do n't . </s>
And we actually -- But John , let me talk about the methane emissions and what we know about the science there . </s>
There has been one study by Cornell University that looks at the methane emissions and has concluded that the methane emissions that are associated with the entire lifecycle of natural gas make it worse than coal . The study has been tremendously critiqued by peers for a number of ways in which that study does not rely on what people know to be the case about emissions . For example , the intergovernmental panel on climate change suggests that you use a hundred-year warming potential , an element that you would use to calculate how much global warming potential there is from a fuel . The Cornell folks have used something very , very different than that , which greatly increases the harm that methane would show relative to coal emissions . There are two or three other technical reasons where the peer critiques have said these all exaggerate the emissions . </s>
Most of the reasonable science has said and there 's a tremendous body of evidence on this , that coal -- when you combust coal at a power plant it will have twice as much emissions of greenhouse gas , including methane , than coal . May I respond to that ? Yes , please . So there 's not one study , but there is a variety of studies , and they rely on estimates of emissions that have information that comes principally from the industry . I know of only one study that actually went out into the field and measured the emissions from the gas well , and that study showed that our methane emissions are about four percent of production . </s>
Now , I agree that we could reduce those if we had better regulations in place , but the industry is out there fighting those regulations . We just had a new EPA rule that was designed to address the emissions from the fracking system , and there was a new rule put in place that would decidedly make it better in terms of methane emissions because they would put the gas pipelines in before they actually let the gas go , and the industry successfully delayed the implementation of this green completion system for another three years . But John , I really -- Let me bring Joe Nocera in , and Joe , let me put the question to you , because you 're a journalist . </s>
You 're paid to be cynical about things . Are corporations -- you made the point that you think the environmentalists are actually the ones who have squeezed information out of the corporations . Is that because that is the dynamic . </s>
In other words -- No . I think -- </s>
The corporations are -- -- in other words , your -- No , I think -- -- but the corporations are dodging and weaving ? </s>
I think the dynamic is actually pretty different . I think the dynamic is that industry began as -- fracking was not started by Exxon or Shell . </s>
Fracking was basically a bunch of small companies who really developed the technology as innovators often do and then the big boys came in . </s>
The environmentalists correctly said , `` This needs to be cleaned up , and it needs to be regulated , and it needs to be looked at more closely . '' And what has happened is that the objections and the rising concern has basically caused industry , especially the big guys , to say , `` You know what ? We really would like to be on the right side of this , and we are going to try and get there . '' And there have actually been -- you know , Shell , one of the big oil companies , they recycle most of the water that they inject in the well . There are lots of things like that going on . </s>
Now , part of the problem is that you ca n't rely on industry best practices . You have to regulate it . And part of the problem is that the regulation is mostly done by the states , not by the federal government . </s>
And so you 're sort of dependent on appropriate state regulation . </s>
Pennsylvania , when they began , did n't regulate it very well . They 've learned a lot . They are regulating it better . It is getting better in Pennsylvania . </s>
Kate Hudson , Joe Nocera paints the portrait of the situation getting better in terms of both government regulation stepping up and companies fessing up , what about that ? Well , I would like to point out that one of the reasons why we 're stuck with state regulation is because the oil and gas companies lobbied their way out of at least a half dozen federal environmental laws and requirements , and so now it 's with the states . And I 'm not particularly impressed by the example of Pennsylvania , which the communities in that state and the environment in that state suffered greatly while the state played regulatory catch-up . And it is still the case that the industry is given a tremendous break . In addition to that , at the state level , across the country , there are not enough regulators to police that . </s>
So even if you had half decent regulations , you do n't have the staff to put in the field to make sure that those regulations are being complied with . Just -- I assume that where this side draws the line though , because you 've said now a couple of times you 're not against fracking , you 're against the pace -- the enthusiasm -- so do you see a future where fracking happens and the Marcellus Shale , the area that is now , at least in the east coast , the most controversial large area covering Pennsylvania and New York state , do you see a future where the regulation that you 're asking for is so effective and the science has been so checked out that if we do go ahead and have 80 years of fracking in that area and that 's okay with you ? Eighty years of fracking is not okay . </s>
We need to get off of fossil fuels a lot faster than that . Okay , so -- </s>
Okay , Joe Nocera . Okay , so -- -- so you want a situation where all jobs are green jobs , and you do n't have a petro- chemical industry because they 're bad guys , and you have a situation where you want to -- let 's assume you could shut down fracking tomorrow , let 's assume that , and your vision is that the consequence of that would be that this would cause a rush to renewables , but that 's not what would happen . </s>
It would cause a rush to coal . The market is buying energy based on its price , and one of the reasons renewables have had so much trouble is because they have a hard time competing with coal . </s>
Coal is the hardest thing to compete with because it 's cheap . So you think that -- what you 're trying to avoid , I understand , is another 100-year cycle of fossil fuel , and that 's admirable , but it 's also unrealistic , and what you have with natural gas is a fuel that is cleaner than coal and maybe could help you get to renewables . And I -- But if it is such a great boon , are they right that basically the -- we 're in a world right now where the price of energy up until very recently has been seen as so egregious that there has been much more effort put towards looking at renewables , and if we suddenly enter into the 1950s again -- wo n't go that far , but if we suddenly get to a place where the price drops tremendously , we’re going to stop the push to find alternatives . </s>
No , we 're not . </s>
The states -- 37 states in the United States have adopted portfolio standards which require renewable energy to be entering the market really almost at any cost , and they are pushing that envelope forward . That is helping to reduce the costs of renewable energy . </s>
That is a fantastic thing -- Yeah , but , Sue , their argument is if we have this sustained period of really relatively less expensive energy , that , that push will fade , and come back again in 80 years when it 's too late . Well , I agree with Joe that if there is a moratorium on natural gas development , unconventional gas around the United States , we 're going back to coal . Yeah , but that 's not the answer to the question . It is the answer to the question whether you like it or not . </s>
It is the answer to the question . That is what will happen in the United States . Right , but will there be a drop-off in looking at alternative -- trying to develop alternative measures ? No , there are policy triggers that are pulling renewable energy development into markets around the country . That is the case . </s>
Okay , a question I want to put to this side . Joe Nocera’s opening remarks talked about a part of this . We have n't touched on it yet at all . </s>
National security , the ability to , you know , have our own private , in oilfield terms , `` Saudi Arabia '' right in our own pocket , right in our own country . We do n't have to deal with these folks anymore . We can try to realize the fantasy of energy independence , and that this is something that we 've been dreaming about for 40 years , that you do n't just walk away from that . And your side basically -- you seem to shrug at that and not treat that as really , really great . </s>
So I 'd like to know why you think that that 's not necessarily germane . Well , I would say first of all Joe was very careful to talk about national -- or energy security and not energy independence , and I do n't think that most economists and energy experts think that what we want is independence in the sense that we are n't going to do any trade on energy issues with any other country . What they are talking about is we want to be doing that trade with people who are our friends . And part of what has happened because we 've been so focused on gas -- and again I really object to the idea that the alternative is , `` Stop it now or 100 years . '' That is not what we 're -- that 's a straw man -- that 's not what we 're arguing here . </s>
But what we have done is we have ceded a lot of the industry that is developing , for example , photovoltaic solar energy , to China . And so if we are not going to actually speed up our development of the renewable energies here , and instead we 're going to be diverted into a 80 years of gas , then we are going to be at a point sometime when we do n't have the resources -- the renewable resources , and we 're going to be importing them sometime . That 's not energy security . The reason -- </s>
So in other words you 're saying it 's -- -- you think it would be a very , very short lived bubble of benefit in terms of energy security ? I do n't actually see where the energy security is going to come ultimately if , in fact , the goal of the gas companies , which has been made clear by 15 applications that have been made to the federal government , to export the natural gas to the European and Asian markets , where they can get four to five times as much money for the gas as they can in the domestic market . So once we start exporting that gas , how is that helping our national energy security right now ? Sue Tierney . </s>
The geopolitics of natural gas and oil are pretty compelling when you look around at a lot of different areas of the world . Parts of Western Europe have been held hostage by getting natural gas across pipelines crossing the Ukraine from Russia , and that has created tremendous problems so that the ability for them to be able to get natural gas from friendly areas is a very compelling story . Same is true for China . China actually has a very large shale gas deposit . They are very interested in learning the knowhow in the United States associated with this technology . </s>
If China is able to use natural gas , they may not build as many Soviet-style nuclear reactors . They may not have challenges with the Middle East oil problem , which is -- that their own internal demand is driving . Joe Nocera . </s>
The thing that -- you mentioned China and you mentioned the solar industry moving to China , and I think it gets to the point that you do n't really want to sort of deal with , which is cost . Solar is moving to China because it 's cheaper , and solar is cheaper -- and the problem renewables have and have had is that they 're in this constant struggle to get the cost down to where it 's cost-effective to use , and it 's cheaper in China . That -- I was on the board of one of the now bankrupt solar energy companies , Evergreen Solar . </s>
It was more cost effective to build the next manufacturing facility and then ship the panels back to the United States to meet the solar market because of China 's subsidies for the industry . So manufacturing is moving to China , but the United States ' demand for solar is not going to mean we 're not going to get solar back . </s>
We will get solar panels back . Right , but the question was , energy security . And the concern was being at the mercy of a country that is n't really aligned with our interests . </s>
And I think that we would mostly agree that unless things change very much , China is not the one that has completely bought into our value system . </s>
And so , we are -- we 're not going to get the energy security . </s>
We may get the cheaper panels , but we are going to be dependent on a hostile country . </s>
All right . </s>
I want to go to questions from the audience now . </s>
And the way it will work is that you raise your hand . A microphone will come to you . I need to tell the folks that are in -- that are not in the lit area that I ca n't see you . </s>
So , if you ca n't see your wristwatch -- read your watch -- I ca n't see you . So , if you want to ask a question , step forward and come to the edge of the light , and I 'll try to take your question . </s>
And again , if you arrived late , I want this to be a question -- not a debate . </s>
These guys are the debaters . Just ask a question that 's on our point , and that 's terse , and that really helps move things along that 's on our topic . Start , right there . </s>
The question I have is to reframe the debate a little bit . Our concern is pollution of our groundwater and our environment with fracking fluids . Joe , you had mentioned that everyone knows what 's in it . </s>
I would take issue with that . Many of the chemicals are trade secrets . How can we allow that ? Why can we not develop a safe -- to use the term loosely -- fracking fluid and use that more exclusively ? Sir , do you mind just telling us your name ? </s>
Phil Rodman . Thanks very much . So -- </s>
Sue Tierney . Full disclosure would be a marvelous thing . I think Joe and I would agree that that should be the case . There is a very narrow piece of the fracking fluid that is what we would call “intellectual property.” In other words , if you could put all the ingredients out there and allow fracking and transparency on that issue , that should be the case . </s>
And your second point was -- I do n't remember . Sorry . Why ca n't we come up with a safer solution ? </s>
Oh , there are many , many green completion approaches . Environmentally friendly fluids . </s>
So , they are on the marketplace , they can be used . </s>
Why do n't we use it ? We should . Let 's go to the other side for a response , so that -- Deborah , Deborah Goldberg . </s>
Well , I mean , there are a lot of things that we could do and we should do . But they 're not happening . And this huge resistance to that is happening . </s>
And so , you know , there 's a great deal of talk about this disclosure system that was created by the Groundwater Protection Council and the industry . </s>
And they 're not disclosing everything . For the most part , they 're disclosing only what is regulated as hazardous under our worker health safety issues . There are a couple of states that have now said that you must disclose everything to the Agency . </s>
But they are not disclosing everything to the public . And transparency remains a huge issue . You know , the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board Subcommittee on Fracking -- on which Sue Tierney served -- talks about transparency in a much broader way , so that we get the data about our water quality , and get the data about our air quality . </s>
None of this is available to the public right now . And we are involved litigation -- this very minute -- to try and get the court record from a case involving public health unsealed so that public health professionals in Pennsylvania can actually see the allegations and use them as part of a database to help prevent and treat health problems in Pennsylvania . And we 're fighting the industry -- Okay . </s>
-- to try to get that transparency . Do you want to respond or -- I just want to mention the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board was unanimous in saying that there should be better disclosure , much better transparency . There must -- much better regulation in all the ways that I just -- But every time you say that , it sounds to me like you 're giving them the argument , because they 're talking about the present-day situation . </s>
I -- and we need to move forward on that . Stop demonizing natural gas as part of that . </s>
And the more that people are moving to the sides of the room -- no one is finding any middle ground on this . </s>
Sir , and -- yes , sir ? If you could , again , just state your name . Thanks . As a model of a question , that was fantastic . </s>
Thank you very much . Do what he did . My name is Dennis Kreutz . Why is not the solution -- and I 'm coming from this with some experience -- slow it down , get the science right , have the industry profit when gas prices are four or five or six dollars instead of two dollars ? </s>
Why is not that the solution to this whole debate ? Okay . I have one answer for that , which I think is very compelling to me . In the period from 2006 through 2011 , when we had dozens and dozens of coal plants being proposed around -- new ones around the country that would lock in large new coal plants for another 50 or 60 years , the changing price of natural gas relative to coal killed those projects . There 's a lot of credit given for environmental opposition to those plants and I will give them some credit , but at the end of the day it was natural gas projects that killed those . </s>
Okay . </s>
Right there . Also , if you have a sense that you 're involved in this issue in a way that would be interesting to the rest of us , if you 're working for an environmental organization or an energy company , share that with us when you introduce yourself . Thanks . My name is Erin Griffin . My question has to do with water usage . </s>
As Colorado and the southwest are projected to become drier as the climate warms , do you think that diverting millions of gallons of water into natural gas wells is an appropriate use of a resource that 's already becoming more precious ? So , John , let me try this . </s>
I 'm on the Natural Climate Assessment study right now on the impact of a changing climate on the energy sector . You 're absolutely right that places will be drier . </s>
There will be more pressure on energy supplies . </s>
But I want to give you the water use for different fuels . Biofuels , ethanol , 5,000 gallons of water per mmbq of energy . Coal , 23 gallons of water per mmbq of energy . </s>
Conventional gas is two and shale gas is two . And how much is wind ? Wind is wonderful , and we 'll quintuple it . </s>
We 'll do 10 times the amount and we still will have a little bit . Is it true , though -- I 'm just trying to go back to sixth grade science when , you know , it rains and then the water evaporates and goes up and becomes a cloud again , and then it rains and comes back to earth and it 's a circle , but that in this process once the waste water has truly been used to the point where it ca n't be recycled , that it 's stored under , you know , stored in wells well underground in perpetuity . So that water is taken out of the sixth grade circulation . Is that -- permanently . </s>
Is that true ? Yes , that 's true . Is that worrisome ? Around the country for decades and decades , underground injection has been the water treatment process of choice . There are parts of the country where that can not work because of the geology underground . </s>
Pennsylvania 's an example where there are very limited areas to be able to do that . </s>
So I want to know if the quantities of water that essentially are being taken out of circulation in a broad sense is significant . We understand that it can impact at a local level , but in a broad sense , are we talking about a significant amount of the Earth 's water ? I’m putting that to the side arguing against fracking . </s>
I have n't really looked globally . The answer to that question is how much fracking do we do ? It varies a great deal , you know , on a local basis , and that 's where the water consumption takes place . So , for example , in the west we do have major problems with drought . </s>
We have forest fires right now . It 's projected to get much worse . In the east we have a lot more water than we have in the west , and the water contamination issues are more serious from our perspective than the water quantity , but on the other hand , if you look locally at , you know , head water streams where we have native trout , you can back up your truck into one of those streams and you can drain it dry and that has happened in Pennsylvania . </s>
So I ca n't say I really have the answer to your question , but -- The country -- Joe Nocera . </s>
The country has historically , in other forms of energy production , oil , for instance , set aside land and said thou shalt not drill here . And , you know , New York is doing the same thing with its watershed and it does n't seem to me unreasonable to say yes , fracking is a good thing for the country , but it has some risks and therefore there are certain places we wo n't do it . </s>
That seems like a completely reasonable approach . I would agree . </s>
But to me that means that you 're agreeing with us that we need to scale back . Because we have -- That 's actually saying you would do it surgically where you know you want to protect things , such as the unfiltered water supply of New York City , which is the way it 's supported there . And it 's great that we found this common ground , because that is n't what the industry is saying in New York . We are not the industry . </s>
I know that . Thank goodness . There . In the center . Microphone will come in -- yeah , thanks , very much . </s>
Can I just -- Yeah , sure , Kate Hudson , . I just wanted to say that I think that the picking out special places that will be protected from fracking has some serious environmental justice issues around that . So the cities , the people who live in New York City , their drinking water will be protected , the other people in other parts of New York City , their drinking water will not be protected ? I think that 's -- </s>
Actually -- -- I think that’s a policy question . Most of New York -- Sue Tierney . -- City 's water supply , as you know , comes from the aquifers upstate . </s>
So we 're talking about all of New York City . No , she 's talking about all of New York State , right ? The -- you know , we do want to see every community protected , not just ones that have a huge amount of political power in down state . And we do n't want to be in a situation where the industry is going into the most economically depressed , most politically powerless areas , and that 's where people are not only unable to make a living , but they 're now being asked to shoulder disproportionate burdens on their health just to keep food on the table . </s>
Could you stand up for us ? Thanks . My name 's Baron Bixler . </s>
And I am just wondering if you could comment on whether you think that the post-9/11 national -- I guess stance on security issues of national security vis-à-vis the Middle East and more recently the great recession has provided the fracking industry with a convenient political backdrop of which to put forth its agenda -- Okay . -- to develop . </s>
All right , I think that question is like a big softball to you guys . So you -- -- can swing at it ? I 'll say . Take a swing ? Kate Hudson ? </s>
No , I think that the -- I 'm not sure actually whether it 's 9/11 itself . I think that the using of the national security energy independence argument to support moving forward with natural gas is playing off of the concerns that the nation has had around 9/11 , but I think as we talked about , we think that that is not actually very realistic . And so -- The country has been trying to -- every president in my memory practically has talked about the importance of weaning ourselves from OPEC oil which -- -- and yet here we are finally in a position to actually do something about it because we have our own resource that -- a resource that we really did n't even know we had 20 years ago . </s>
And so 9/11 may have spurred the urgency to do this . I mean , my goodness , we have invaded countries , and we have -- our entire foreign policy towards the Middle East is consciously or subconsciously about oil . And so the idea that we can change the way we think about other countries , the way we can deal with foreign policy , because we no longer have to sit around and worry about whether they 're going to give us our oil or not seems to me like a wonderful thing . </s>
Kate Hudson . The vast majority of the oil that we use in this country is used for the transportation sector . Natural gas is not going to replace that . </s>
Natural gas can be used -- -- the power sector , but not for the transportation sector . She 's wrong . </s>
Well , let me just pick up on Kate 's -- Actually , just a moment for the other side to respond to because I want to hear what they have to say . Sue Tierney . Every thoughtful well documented study that looks at how the United States will transform and decarbonize its economy includes shifting more of the transportation sector to electricity and natural gas , putting carbon capture and sequestration on natural gas facilities , but there is a role for fossil in that decarbonized world , and oil is about this much and it 's in the aviation sector . You know -- </s>
Well , let me -- There is -- Well , let me let Deborah come -- Joe , let me let Deborah come back because she -- But I was just going to say that Joe recognized Fred Krupp as somebody who he thought was reasonable and authoritative . And the Environmental Defense Fund has recently done a study , looking at the climate impacts of shifting from coal to gas , and I will tell you that they do find , they do agree that we would do better , assuming that our methane emissions do n't rise to the level of four percent , but they absolutely disagree that if we shift our entire transportation system from oil to gas , that we are going to have net climate benefits over as much as 100 years . </s>
So I think we can agree that there might be a small part . There 's natural gas buses in New York City . There might be small amounts , but shifting the whole sector over is just a non-starter . Joe Nocera . </s>
Let me say two quick things about that . First of all , what EDF has actually said is that if methane leakage can come down and , the idea that we ca n't have any technology to make things better seems to me pretty unreasonable . Technology does make things better , and the idea that we 're always going to be stuck even if in fact , if we are today , at four percent methane leakage , is not necessarily the way it 's going to play out . Secondly , it 's already happening . Not only are buses fueled by natural gas in cities , but large trucking companies are beginning to convert to natural gas , and large energy companies are beginning to think about putting natural gas stations on the interstate highway . </s>
All right , question down in the front row . Sir , could you stand and tell us your name and if you 're affiliated with the -- Arnie Togan . I 've written a lot of legislation , and I 've helped with a lot of legislation and I just want to congratulate you on the scare tactics that you used , because believe it or not it helps us write our legislation . An example of it -- </s>
Sir , can you -- can you just bring it to a question for them ? Okay , I just wonder if stopping this process is the answer . That 's not what we have advocated . So I would say , `` No , '' once again . </s>
Another question . I 'm sorry that I 'm tending towards the , right there , did you have your hand up ? Yep . Yes , she did . </s>
Okay , yeah . I mean , all right , I 'll come back to you . Go ahead , sir . </s>
My name 's Kevin Alt , and an engineer in the oil business . </s>
I have fracked wells in Pennsylvania , fracked wells Texas , Oklahoma , New Mexico . You give the impression that the science has to catch up . Do you have any idea how long we 've been fracking wells ? We have been fracking wells not for shale gas for many decades , but the shale gas fracturing , which includes two technologies used together , the horizontal drilling and the hydraulic fracturing , has been used , seriously , only for about a decade , and it 's the impacts of the shale gas drilling that are driving all that opposition , because we are not prepared for the volume of the wastewater , and we have nobody out there in the federal government and in many states that are looking cumulatively at all of the impacts . So it 's about wastewater ? </s>
It is wastewater . But , I 'm sorry , I do n't understand the question . I -- you actually did ask the question , but I ca n't have you debate . But do you want to ask a follow-up question ? </s>
Yeah , you -- Okay . -- you said first that it 's about methane leakage . Wastewater is handled efficiently coming out of all the wells . And again , Pennsylvania will adapt very quickly to this . </s>
So I -- this is not a wastewater question , and it 's not a wastewater management question . Where is the wastewater going that 's coming out of the well ? Into water disposal wells . In Ohio . </s>
In Pennsylvania as well . There 's one commercial well that takes shale gas wastewater in all of Pennsylvania and - - But there’s lots of private wells . They -- they 're not taking this -- </s>
Sir , I 'm going to end this because -- not because I do n't think it 's a legitimate point but I just do n't want you to be the debater . </s>
That 's their job here -- Because it 's so much fun when you are . Good evening , I 'm Kathy LeMieux- Rodman . I thank you all for being here . It 's been a wonderful presentation . </s>
Joe , this is for you and Sue . I was on the board at EDF for many years and watched legislation for coal and for many years how the lawyers handled scrubbers and a lot of other work . </s>
It was wonderful . Joe , you bring up the question of national security . If you look backwards at where we 've come with environment extraction , anything taking anything out of the earth has plus and minus , but there 's short term and long term gain . My question to you is , as a journalist , would you address the issue of water as national security over the next 100 years , because as we pollute our water , we do n't have water to drink , that 's going to be an issue , and , Sue , with all you 're doing , all your analysis -- Okay , but water is going to be one of the central issues of the century that we live in . </s>
There 's no question about that , and there 's also no question that we have to work hard to avoid polluting our water , and that 's why I advocate that there are areas that we should n't frack , and I also think -- this is why I also -- on this side of the table , we 're not saying , “Frack horribly.” </s>
We 're not saying , “Hey , let 's put the worst wells in we can and let them leak and damage the environment.” What we 're saying is if you do it responsibly , if you do it in a regulated way , you minimize the possibility . You do n't eliminate it . You do n't eliminate all risk . Okay . </s>
Right down in the front there . I thought I understood the question that we were going to vote on before I came in here . </s>
But as this is continued , it seems to me we 're talking about matters of degrees . </s>
So , when we do cast our votes , are we voting for no fracking , with this red sign that says “None” ? Or are we voting for some degree of fracking that 's controlled -- but it sounds to me like you 're both saying the same thing , with different , different degrees of . </s>
All right . </s>
Let me -- </s>
First of all -- first of all -- to clearly clarify , we 're not saying “No fracking at all.” We 're -- the motion says that the cost-benefit analysis -- it 's a judgment on the cost-benefit analysis as opposed to immediately making a policy decision . That said , where is the -- where is the disagreement between these two sides ? Well , I was worried about that actually , when we were going into this , because it seems to me that we 're probably much closer than the organizers of this event might have thought . So , we 're trying to make for a lively debate -- </s>
I do n't -- I do n't agree . I think -- I -- I think that -- He does n't agree with you already . Thank you . Joe . </s>
The people on this side believe that the issues of the economic benefits , the security benefits , and even the environmental benefits make fracking -- the benefits far outweigh the costs . And that is our view . And I do n't think you’ve said anything that really has changed our minds on that . The issue we 're -- do we care about having it done right ? </s>
Yes , we do . </s>
Do we think the benefits are tremendous for America ? Yes , we do . And -- We think the benefits would still be there -- Sue Tierney . </s>
-- if we added 50 cents to the price of natural gas to cover these things ? Yes . The benefits are huge . </s>
But I would say -- Kate Hudson . -- that the question here is not whether we can do it right at some point in the future , but whether we 're doing it right now . Right now -- </s>
All right . I have to say , that concludes Round 2 of this Intelligence Squared U.S. debate . </s>
Thank you . </s>
And now we go on to Round 3 . </s>
And Round 3 is where each of the debaters has a last chance to persuade you to their point of view or to persuade you that they 've actually presented the better argument . Our motion is this : No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good . Each debater gets two minutes to summarize his or her position . And speaking first , against this motion , Joe Nocera , an Op-Ed columnist for “The New York Times.” </s>
You can applaud . Let me do that again . You do n't have to . I 'll do that again . And speaking against the motion , Joe Nocera , an Op-Ed columnist for “The New York Times.” </s>
On some level , I gave my closing argument about two seconds ago . I do feel that it 's clear that natural gas has reduced emissions . It is demonstrably better than coal . </s>
It is offering us the possibility -- wonderful possibility -- to wean ourselves from Mideast oil . And it 's been incredibly economically beneficial for the country to have gas plentiful and cheap . I want to say -- I really want to end on , on this spot . Our opponents -- I want to think about it this way . When you 're arguing against fracking , you 're not arguing for a future of renewables . </s>
You may think you are , but you 're not . You 're arguing for the status quo . You 're arguing for a world where coal is still the dominant power generation , where oil is still the fundamental fuel that we use to transport ourselves . You know , all the problems that we have today that have been brought about by the way we use energy are still with us . And so , what I would ask the other side to think about is , what does the future look like if we do n't have fracking ? </s>
What does the future look like if we do n't have this wonderful source of natural gas , this abundant source of gas that we 've been given . I do n't think the future looks all that well -- all that good . </s>
Thank you very much . Thank you , Joe Nocera . Our motion is No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good and here to summarize their position in support of this motion , Kate Hudson , watershed program director for Riverkeeper . Having heard what our opponents have said here tonight , you might think we should not be concerned about the impacts of fracking . In their view , any problems we have now will be fixed with golden rules , more regulation , and hopes of improved technology . </s>
I think of a few reasons to remain concerned . </s>
One , there will always be accidents , spills , mechanical failures , and human error . Two , the gas industry has consistently fought enforceable rules and there is insufficient state and federal staff to ensure compliance with what rules do exist . Three , the idea that the industry as a whole will comply with voluntary best practices -- as I think our opponents have acknowledged -- in the face of falling gas prices , is unlikely . </s>
Given the continued risk of harm and all of frackings costs weighed against its limited benefits for most , it is beyond dispute that the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good . Simply ask the mothers of children who attend the Red Hawk Elementary School in the Front Range town of Eerie , Colorado . </s>
Last fall there were children who stayed home from school with intestinal and breathing problems due to the hundreds of oil drill rigs -- gas drill rigs in the region . Then , the industry insisted on locating gas wells a few hundred yards from the school and a short distance from a school playing field . </s>
Parents and children joined together to protest the new well and the town put a temporary moratorium on new permits , but that does not apply to the already permitted elementary school site . So this summer , as drilling takes place , teenage boys will have football practice in the shadow of operating drill rigs . The families of Eerie make it clear , if this uncontrolled experiment , which is the natural gas boom , is allowed to continue , homeowners , farms , schools , and hospitals whose neighbors agree to lease will have no choice . But we have a choice now . The shale gas boom is doing more harm than good and we urge you all to say -- to vote no fracking way . </s>
Thank you , Kate Hudson . And that is our motion , No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good , and here to summarize her position against the motion , Sue Tierney , former assistant secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Energy . I was -- I was also secretary of environmental affairs in Massachusetts , head of the environmental police , head of environmental regulation . I came into this field because I grew up in southern California and could n't stand the fact that we could n't see the mountains from where I lived . </s>
I went into energy because it seemed to me it was an unbelievably complicated world in which you had these environmental impacts , which were so compelling , and yet you had everybody using cars and a variety of things . In the 30 years that I 've been in the energy and environmental fields , I have never seen more polarizing and demonizing discussions as now exist on shale gas , and I saw nuclear plant debates , I saw transmission line plants , everything . </s>
This is one where the science and the information is -- the gap between what we know and what people say we know is wider than I 've seen in any other field . The reason I bring this up is this polarizing part of it makes it impossible for the two sides to find the middle ground , and that 's why this issue is we need to stop demonizing this particular fuel , because if we do that we kill it and we kill not only the benefits that Joe just described , but we get back to coal . And that is the reality that we face and I urge you , for that reason , to vote against this proposition . Thank you , Sue Tierney . Our motion is No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good , and here to summarize her position in support of the motion , no fracking way , Deborah Goldberg , the managing attorney at Earthjustice . </s>
I 'd like to close with two of my favorite quotes from my opponents . </s>
In February of this year , Joe Nocera wrote , `` How much methane leaks into the air as a result of fracking ? '' Incredibly , nobody knows . In May of this year , Sue Tierney said on NPR , `` Fifty years from now , are we really going to be wondering if we really screwed up because we went on this big gas boom ? You really would n't want to be F-ing that up , '' and I agree . We do n't know , and we really do n't want to be messing that up . </s>
And that means we need to scale back , slow down , and resist the boom mentality . We have to scale back . We do not have to drill hundreds of thousands of wells just because we can . We do n't have to drill near elementary schools , and we can protect our state forests and our parks . We need to slow down . </s>
We need to take the time to let the science catch up with the practice and the safeguards catch up with the science , and we need the resources to ensure that the rules we have in place are vigorously enforced . </s>
There 's no rush . The gas has been there for millions of years . It 's not going away . Finally , we have to ignore the advertising slogans on both sides , the demonizing goes on on both sides , filling the airways , and stop living in a fantasy world of endless fossil fuel consumption without consequences . </s>
We need to restart the conversation about putting a price on carbon , and we need to develop a real meaningful energy policy , not “all of the above.” That 's no policy at all . </s>
Does that make sense to you ? Do you want to limit the intensive gas development and the breakneck speed of fracking until we answer the open scientific questions and put policies in place to ensure that we are not messing up ? Then you should vote for us , because you recognize , as we do , that until we have those safeguards in place and until we have that information , we have nothing but an uncontrolled experiment and the natural gas boom is doing more harm than good . Thank you very much , Deborah Goldberg . </s>
And that concludes Round 3 and this Intelligence Squared Debate . And now it 's time to find which side you feel has argued best . We 're going to ask you again to go to the keypads at your seat . Remember , we had you vote at the beginning of the debate on where you stood on this motion , No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good . '' </s>
You 've heard the arguments . </s>
We want to ask you to judge which side presented their arguments best . If you agree that this side presented the best arguments , the side that is for the motion , but that means that they are against , in a broad sense , fracking , push number one . If it’s the other side , which takes the opposite position , push number two . </s>
And if you are undecided or became undecided , push number three . </s>
And we 'll lock in the results in about 10 seconds , and in about 90 seconds we 'll have the numbers for the two comparisons . </s>
So while that 's being tabulated backstage , I just want to -- I really want to thank these debaters for doing what we asked them to do which was really bring good arguments to the -- -- and also just by point of comparison , it 's our first time in Aspen , and , you know , as a rule , audience questions can be a sort of tricky area to go to . </s>
Tonight , this audience was spectacular in the questions , not just in the format , but really you moved things along , you put very , very interesting things into this debate , so I want to give yourselves a round of applause for that . You did really good . So just a few things to say , we want to again thank the Aspen Institute for inviting us down to this year 's Ideas Festival , for letting you see what it is that we do back in New York at Intelligence Squared U.S . Thank you very much for the American Clean Skies Foundation , for their underwriting support for this , and making it all happen . And if some of you are New Yorkers or going to New York , we want to let you know that this fall -- what we intend to do with our series of debate topics is to try to follow the ebb and flow of the dialogue that 's taking place in the presidential election , and keep -- you know , bounce off what 's actually happening in that debate by exploring the issues in more depth in our own debates . </s>
And so the motions that we 're working on now will be announced in several weeks , and also who the debaters will be . </s>
So we have a website , IQ2US.org . </s>
You can go look to that . You can buy tickets there and keep in touch with us . </s>
And if you get to New York , please do come . Also , in mid-October , we 're going to be on the road again . We 're going to be going this time to Chicago . This 'll be our second annual Chicago Ideas Week . If you 're in New York , I should say , our -- we 're changing locations . </s>
We 're going to the Kauffman Center , which is near Lincoln Center . We can be seen on public television in New York and also here and around the country on the 220+ NPR stations . </s>
We also have a podcast that is on iTunes . And we have a newsletter . You can sign up for our website . So again , thank you very much for the debaters and for your participation . </s>
And now we have the results , and we 'll find out what happened . So remember , before the debate we asked you to vote on this motion , No Fracking Way : The Natural Gas Boom is Doing More Harm Than Good . If you 're for the motion , it means you 're saying , `` No fracking way . '' </s>
If you 're against the motion , you are disagreeing with `` No fracking way . '' So before the debate , 38 percent of you were for the motion `` No fracking way , '' 53 percent were against . After the -- I 'm sorry -- I 'm sorry , it 's a split . I 'm going to start this again . Before the debate , 38 percent of you were for the motion , 38 percent , against , evenly split , and 24 percent were undecided . </s>
After the debate , 53 percent of you are for the motion `` No fracking way , '' that 's up 15 percent , 42 percent are against , that 's up only four percent , five percent are undecided , that means the team arguing for the motion `` No fracking way , '' has won this debate . Our congratulations to them . </s>
Thank you from me , John Donvan of Intelligence Squared U.S. , and we 'll see you next time . null . Can I ask everyone to come sit down , please ? Hello . My name’s Jeffrey Toobin , I’m the moderator and warm-up act here today , and I just wanted to explain a few things before we got started . </s>
The first thing I wanted to say , which I’m sure is a great shock to you , is please turn off your cell phones . Ah , see , everybody’s… Also , please unwrap any delicious candies you plan on eating during the program . Now , I say this not because it is incredibly annoying to listen to both cell phones and candy unwrapping , but if you look above you , you will see that there are microphones . </s>
This event is being recorded and is going to be broadcast on WNYC and other NPR stations next Friday at 2 p.m. in an edited form . Now , that is significant just because it’s interesting , but it also means that you are an integral part of the broadcast . Your questions , when it comes to that , but also your reactions . </s>
If you want to clap , if you want to laugh , by all means feel free . This is not a solemn occasion , you’re expected to participate in it . </s>
Extended booing is discouraged , but please , have fun . Now , this is very good , because I’m also supposed to , as a radio check , ask you to give a rousing round of applause . So since our panelists are coming out , why don’t you do that . Let me let Robert Rosenkranz take over from here . </s>
Thank you , Jeffrey . Well , good evening , everyone , and thank you for being here . I’m Robert Rosenkranz , I’m the chairman of the Intelligence Squared U.S . Debate Forum , which is an initiative of the Rosenkranz Foundation . I’m here with Dana Wolf , our executive producer of this debate series . </s>
We’d like to welcome you . This is the second debate of our fall season , and with this season of live debates , and with our national radio audience , we’re pursuing a lofty , ambitious goal . We’re trying to raise the level of public discourse in American life . </s>
We see Congress mired in partisan rancor , we see a media that’s increasingly ideological , we see policy intellectuals in the think-tank world speaking to their respective choirs . Discussion of contentious policy issues everywhere seems to be dominated by intense emotions , rather than by facts and reasoned analysis . </s>
But IQ Squared is not about the search for bland middle ground . Rather , we want to encourage each side of an argument to sharpen its own thinking by listening to opposing views , and responding to inconvenient facts . We want our audience , who voted on tonight’s resolution , to vote again after hearing the debate . I hope you’ll come away with the recognition that there is an intellectually respectable position on the other side . </s>
We’re thrilled that WNYC is recording our series of debates , and that through National Public Radio , you’ll be able to hear this debate in many of the major cities across the country , on local National Public Radio-member stations . We also value the sponsorship of the Times of London , and I especially want to thank our moderator , Jeffrey Toobin of The New Yorker magazine , and CNN , whom I will formally introduce momentarily , and the extraordinary group of panelists who are the true stars of tonight’s event . At first blush , tonight’s motion seems like a slam-dunk for the proposers . 95 percent of the pertinent quotations I looked at were ringing supports of free speech . </s>
But there were a couple of more sardonic observations that are perhaps truer to our real attitudes . Here’s Heywood Broun : “Everyone favors free speech in the slack moments , when no axes are being ground.” Louis B. Mayer : “I respect my executives who disagree with me…especially when it means losing their jobs.” Well , it’s amusing , but we do indeed live in a world where jobs are lost because of speech . Larry Summers , for example , lost the presidency of Harvard because of remarks offensive to women . </s>
Senator George Allen may well lose his because of a highly arcane ethnic epithet . So given the heightened sensitivity of so many groups in American society to demeaning speech , we should hardly be surprised that speech offensive to Muslims elicits so strong a reaction , as appalled as we may be by the associated violence . I’m now going to hand the evening over to our moderator , Jeffrey Toobin . Jeffrey is senior legal analyst for CNN Worldwide , and is staff writer at The New Yorker , where he’s been covering legal affairs since 1993 . He and I are both alumni of the Harvard Law School . </s>
He joined CNN from ABC News where he provided legal analysis on such high-profile cases as the Elian Gonzales custody saga , for which he received the Emmy Award . Jeffrey’s fifth book , on the Supreme Court , is due out next year , and it’s called The Nine : Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court . You’re the first to know that title because it was only decided upon today . </s>
I’m now very pleased to turn the evening over to Jeffrey . Thank you , enjoy the debate . Thank you , Bob Rosenkranz , and welcome to the second Intelligence Squared US debate . </s>
Let me give you a brief rundown of the evening . First , the proposer of the motion will start by presenting their side of the argument . The opposition will follow . Each person will get a maximum of eight minutes and we’ll go back and forth from one side to the other . Then , when all six speakers are finished with their opening remarks , I will open the floor to brief questions from the audience . </s>
Third , when the Q- and-A is complete , each debater will make a final statement lasting not more than two minutes each . Fourth , during the closing arguments , ballot boxes will be passed around for voting . </s>
You all have your tickets , I assume , and if you don’t have your tickets with the “For” and “Against” on it , just raise your hand , some of the folks in the aisle have extra tickets . Ballot stuffing is discouraged . </s>
Also , there are pencils and paper for people who want to jot down questions while the debate is going on . Last , after the final closing statement is made , I will announce the results of the audience vote and tell you which side carried the day . </s>
For the motion , let me introduce our panelists . Author and editor of The Paris Review and a long-time staff writer for The New Yorker , Philip Gourevitch . Prolific British author , journalist , literary critic , contrarian intellectual and subject of a New Yorker profile just last week , Christopher Hitchens . Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist for the Philadelphia Daily News , Signe Wilkinson . Against the motion , British scholar of Jewish history and research professor in history at Royal Holloway , University of London , David Cesarani . </s>
Executive director of the American Society for Muslim Advancement , Daisy Khan . </s>
Author , professor of law at Georgetown University Law Center and activist scholar , Mari Matsuda . So let’s begin . Signe Wilkinson , you’re first . </s>
Thank you , and thank you , Jeffrey . Since World War III almost started over a bunch of cartoons , I want to thank this evening’s organizers for including a cartoonist—two , if you include Christopher Hitchens . </s>
150 years ago , the Tammany Hall politician Boss Tweed responded to an offensive cartoon against him with the famous line , “Stop them damn pictures.” The reason we’re here tonight , is that these days , everyone wants to stop them damn pictures , if the damn pictures in question hurt their feelings or the feelings of their tribe . When I say everyone , I mean everyone . Early in my career , I penned this badly-drawn cartoon , “Fundamental Sex Ed—does the stork bring AIDS and herpes too ? ” </s>
I expected calls from the fundamentalist ministers in the area , but no , I got calls from schoolteachers saying , “Not all teachers are fat , old and carry rollers ! ” Schoolteachers aren’t alone . In the course of my 25 years as a paid professional offender , I have been attacked for criticizing people of color , people without much color , people of guns , people of excessive weight , people with trial lawyers , and Armenian people . This is a partial list , and certainly doesn’t begin to cover people of religion , who are the touchiest people of all . Unfortunately for the pious , Americans like their damn cartoons and they always have . </s>
In nine—in 1872 , Joseph Keppler drew this tribute to religion , which as you can see on the lower left , offensive caricatures Jews , and on the right , offensively caricatures Catholics . </s>
But wait—in the middle , he offensively caricatures Episcopalians , Mormons , Baptists , Presbyterians , and even Henry Ward Beecher , the New Age minister and adulterer of his age . If we had more time , I’d show more cartoons . </s>
So , when newcomers arrive on our shores , with their deeply held religious beliefs , they should be prepared to get in line to have those beliefs scrutinized , as they did in the mid-1800s when New York City , like Denmark today , was awash with poor foreign immigrants who came with their robed clerics and demands for separate schools . These were of course Catholics , not Muslims , but some American cartoonists reacted just the way the Danes did . </s>
In 1871 , the father of American cartoonists , Thomas Nast , drew this . “The American River Ganges.” The hats of the reptilian bishops crawling ashore have menacing crocodile teeth—certainly the precursors of a turban as a bomb . </s>
Usually , my colleagues don’t go out of their way to kick a clergyman . However , when the clergy ask for special privileges , demand special tax cuts , or are just especially misbehaving , we take notice . This Pat Oliphant , “The Running of the Altar Boys”… You’re cutting into my time , stop laughing . </s>
It was embraced by many lay Catholics , but bitterly denounced by official Catholicism . </s>
Note to church leaders—if you don’t want your clerics ridiculed as child abusers , make sure they don’t abuse children . Had Americans been able to see the Danish cartoons , they would’ve noted that they too were not just gratuitous attacks on the faithful . One was making fun of the idea that after blowing up innocent people , suicide bombers would be rewarded with virgins in Heaven . If you can’t make fun of that , what can you make fun of . </s>
What really enraged believers wasn’t that Mohammed was pictured but that he was pictured negatively . </s>
To test the point , at the height of the controversy I put Mohammed in this cartoon , “The Big Fat Book of Offensive Religious Cartoons.” </s>
He’s third from the right , flanked by Jesus and God , and a few other laughing deities . No one protested this because no one cared about Mohammed being drawn as jolly and benign . </s>
However , I have been picketed without putting Mohammed in a cartoon . “Radical Islam Sponsors the Miss Muslim World Contest—Miss Illiteracy , Miss Can’t Vote , Miss Waiting to Be Stoned.” When I say picketed , I mean picketed , including… including by one of my daughter’s high school history teachers . But Muslims aren’t alone in their selective outrage . </s>
My Jewish readers were okay with the drawing with the Star of David that was pro-Israel , but roasted me for one that criticized a local Jewish senator who was attacking his opponent for being anti- Semitic . Critics said that the Star of David was off-limits— unless , apparently , it was used to make a point that they agreed with . What critics of offensive cartoons forget is that every time I exercise my free speech , my readers exercise theirs , swiftly and loudly . For that last little sketch with the Star of David , our paper received and printed weeks of vilifying letters . The Anti- Defamation League denounced me , I was called a Nazi , and the senator’s son helpfully suggested to my editors how they could better use my talents . </s>
One reader wrote that I was worthy of Hustler magazine , which at my age I take as something of a compliment . Speaking of Hustler , its publisher , Larry Flynt , is the patron saint of cartoonists . When Hustler ran a spoof claiming that Jerry Falwell’s first sexual encounter was with his mother in an outhouse the right reverend Falwell did the Christian thing , and sued , in a case that went to the Supreme Court in 1987 . </s>
The unanimous decision was written by that famed pinko degenerate , William Rehnquist , who wrote that “Even though the spoof was outrageous , outrageousness in the area of political and social discourse is inherently subjective , ” and that “the court has long protected free speech , even speech that offends the audience.” So the offended are left with the same option I use—free speech . They can and do write , call , picket , boycott , and draw their own cartoons , but in America , thank God and the Constitution , they can’t claim special privileges and stop them damn pictures . </s>
Thank you . Next , against the proposition , Mari Matsuda . Thank you , Jeffrey , and thank you , Signe , for making us laugh and making my job so hard . It’s really not fair to put me after the cartoonist , but I volunteered to go first . I’m sorry , I didn’t bring cartoons , and I’m not going to make you laugh . </s>
I stand before you a censored person . Under American law , there are several things that I could not say . </s>
I could not attempt to sell you snake oil as a cure for cancer . </s>
I couldn’t tell you secrets that I know that could make you millions of dollars when the stock market opens tomorrow . I couldn’t tell a lie that would harm the reputation of any of the people on this stage . And I could not yell “Fire ! ” in a believable way that would cause a stampede for the exits . This point is the lawyer’s point . In a complex society , law necessarily mediates between competing interests . </s>
Speech is one of those interests , and it is profoundly valuable . But when speech comes up against other interests that are also valuable , we have no choice . We mediate , we draw lines , we balance . </s>
This is what we do . My second point is a humanitarian point—that words are weapons . They can assault , wound degrade , exclude , and incite harm of stunning proportions . </s>
I am a citizen born of the last century , one that had genocide right in its center . That century will forever color my view of the harm that human beings are capable of . Propaganda is not a parlor game and rhetoric is not recreation . Words have consequences . </s>
I take words seriously enough to make them my vocation , and I believe that some words should remain unspoken . </s>
My third claim is that I am a Constitutionalist and a civil libertarian . I believe that individuals exist prior to the state and that the state must remain accountable to its citizens . Thus I am allied with my opponents in this debate in their healthy distrust of limits on speech . </s>
Indeed , if we had time to discuss the entire history of suppression of dissent in this country , my guess is that all six of us here on this stage would agree that the record contains many deplorable episodes . So why do I diverge on the particular question of assaultive speech and urge you to vote no tonight ? It is precisely because I value speech . </s>
As I see it , there are two main reasons for the First Amendment or for our protection of speech . </s>
One is simply that we respect individual choices . Each of us is sovereign over ourselves and entitled to express the cry of our own heart . The second reason is functional . We need democracy in order for our individual selves to thrive , and we need speech in order for democracy to thrive . </s>
Democracy requires that each and every individual speak , think , study , know , and participate in self- governance . When hate speech and propaganda instill beliefs of inherent inferiority , the very things that the First Amendment is intended to protect are at risk . When racist invective keeps you away from a public hearing , as has happened , when sexual taunting keeps you away from a job , as has happened , democracy’s prerequisites of mutual exchange and participation are gone . My students tell me , you’ve got to give examples , people don’t understand without examples . </s>
So I’ll give you one from the Asian-American community . Right after the last major San Francisco earthquake , the big one , there was a public debate about whether to rebuild certain sections of the freeway . </s>
One off-ramp in particular that led into Chinatown was of concern to the residents of that community , and they turned out for a public hearing . Well , the white Aryan Resistance also decided to do a show of force at that hearing , in their full Nazi stormtrooper regalia . </s>
This is pre-Internet so instead of a Web site they had a hotline you could call to hear racist invective and find out who had testified at that hearing . Many of the elders and merchants in that community would come out to testify , and it was their first experience with participation in the democratic process . They were frightened away , and were very unlikely to come out again as the debate continued around this issue of political discourse . If you think about why we disallow defamation , or impose legal penalties for it , it’s because reputation is part of the self , and it’s part of the self that’s needed to participate equally in the democratic conversation . </s>
If you lose standing in the community you lose liberty . The freedom to move about as a respected person , to speak credibly , to join your fellow citizens in this grand social contract that we call democracy . Your reputation is valuable , and thus we will restrain speech when it takes your reputation from you . I submit that there are forms of assaultive speech that have very much the same effect . </s>
I’ve asked for 30 years why we penalize someone who calls a doctor a quack , but we won’t penalize someone who says that by race , the doctor is inherently worthless and properly subject to extermination . I haven’t received an answer . If you believe , as I do , that unbridled freedom to wound with words and to incite through propaganda can harm the very freedom that we intend to protect by protecting speech , then I suggest that you vote against the proposition . The other side will tell you we can’t start down that path of deciding which speech is acceptable , or we become trapped in the censorship business . </s>
This is a rhetorical move that lawyers call the slippery slope . What the other side will not tell you is that we are already on the slippery slope of tolerating censorship of certain forms of speech , including libel , fraud , copyright infringement , conversations in restraint of trade . </s>
There is no easy and absolute way out . We do have to decide when , where , and how we will limit speech . The call of the question here uses the word “offensive.” </s>
But let me make clear that none of us would be engaged in this debate if we were just talking about table manners , or humorous insults with political purpose , the right to offend that Signe Wilkinson is talking about . If we say that we are closing the door , taking an absolutist position , giving a free license to those who would use words to assault , we’re doing much more than just allowing political cartoons , which I think should be protected absolutely , we can discern how to do that under our legal system . But what I’m really getting at is words that are intended to wound , and to stop people from equal participation in society . </s>
If I spit on your shoe , you can sue me for that , it’s called a battery . There are words I could use that would have the same effect on your psyche , your personhood , or your ability to move freely . Yet if you vote for this proposition you’re saying that that form of assault is allowed . It happens in this city and elsewhere in our country . </s>
Thank you , vote no . </s>
continue after running out of time , hence Gourevitch’s comment Philip Gourevitch . Extraordinary how people who want to silence public speech won’t shut up . We’re faced tonight with people who want to stop cartooning but who make a caricature of the concept of free speech . They are not here to discuss free speech , they are here to discuss their deep conviction that speech is not free and therefore should not be free . </s>
That is essentially what the previous speaker said , she said there is no free speech , let’s be real , and therefore there should be no free speech and we should simply start restricting it endlessly . </s>
Since we are being cartooned as the monstrous side , let me begin with a monstrous image . In Northern Uganda for the last 15 to 20 years , there has been a movement known as the Lord’s Resistance Army . It practices its warfare in the name of God , and what it does when it dislikes the speech that is being made is that it cuts off the lips of the citizens who are speaking and it puts padlocks through punctured holes in their lips and shuts them . </s>
I’m afraid that I’m very much unable to picture these people doing that , but it’s very clear to me that that is what they wish to do . I will return to this image at the end , but that is the image that clearly you must bear in mind as you , the jury tonight , vote on the question of whether we shall be permitted to speak or whether we shall be inclined to silence anybody in whom we find offense . That is what they are saying , and who are they to judge what is offensive ? Surely you have different ideas , surely we all have different ideas , and yet somehow , the concept of offense is being proposed by the other side as some sort of universal measure of civilization rather than the opposite . But one point of agreement that we have is that speech is fiercely powerful , and can be intensely dangerous . </s>
I spent some time reporting from Rwanda in the aftermath of the genocide there . The previous speaker referred to genocide , and one of the most striking things in Rwanda is that in a great deal of the genocide was incited by public speech , radio speech , incitement through words . The words were used as hate speech , which we will find the other side thinks should be censored because it is dangerous . </s>
The hate speech said , invariably , kill the minority , the Tutsis . They didn’t always say it directly , they would use euphemisms and the euphemisms would be phrases like “Do your work . Clear the bush . Do not let a weed escape the blade.” </s>
These were phrases that were well understood in the historical context and they were clearly hate speech , there’s no ambiguity about it . Those people have been tried and convicted for inciting mass murder in their country . </s>
The problem there was not free speech for haters . It was that this was the officially sanctioned speech by people who prohibited sanity from being free speech . Anybody who protested against the genocide was silenced as offensive . Offensive speech , my goodness . That Hutus and Tutsis should live side by side in comity , that they should allow each other to exist—how offensive . </s>
Let’s silence them . </s>
Let’s murder them . </s>
Let us have official speech . </s>
That was the position . That is the position which—yes , ma’am . “Slippery slope.” </s>
It’s not a slippery slope , it’s a greased precipice over which they wish to push you . Once you start to say that racist or blasphemous speech is somehow or other offensive , you’re immediately on the quick descent towards book-burning . The books that you wish to burn are the books that include , let’s say , Huck Finn , where racists are used in possibly the 19th century’s noblest portrait of a black man in America . Blasphemous speech is used by Ahab . Most people who are burning books are of course too illiterate to notice . </s>
But let’s focus on the facts . They consistently elevate idiotic speech , like Holocaust denial , to a greatly important role by saying , lets us illegalize it , challenge it in courts , give these people a tremendous platform , and prove that they’re wrong…when no sane person can possibly suspect that this is serious history . </s>
So we’re going to have to elevate them in order to silence them , rather than to ignore them , to discuss it with them . I would like to quote to you a short passage from David Cesarani in which he wrote , “Celebrating Austria’s Law Criminalizing Holocaust Denial.” </s>
This was in The Guardian . “Thanks to the Internet , ” he claims , “it is virtually impossible to stop the dissemination of laws and propaganda these days . The classical arguments of freedom of speech drawn from Voltaire and Mill are redundant.” So we have an anti-enlightenment argument very strongly stated . “They addressed small , literate elites at a time when the means of reproduction were relatively few and easily controlled , when it was easy to contend that in a contest between truth and falsehood held among reasonable men , lies would be exposed and driven from the public sphere . </s>
But the Internet is awash with falsehood and bigotry . Good ideas and beautiful truths coexist with trash and outright evil . Heaven forfend that bad ideas should be out there . </s>
Amid this anarchy , ” he says , “all that decent people can do is agree to reasonable limits on what can be said and set down legal markers in an attempt to preserve a democratic , civilized and tolerant society.” That’s what he says . I say , who gives him the right to set up a chair in the antechambers of my mind and judge what I’m allowed to say and what I’m allowed to think . Is that what you want ? Is that who you want ? </s>
How does it avail the cause of civilization , sir , to fight brownshirts with brownshirt tactics ? I would like to know that . </s>
What I share with this pious trinity of the opposing team is a deeply pessimistic view of human history . I do not believe that if you let people run around loose they’re going to have nice ideas about each other and behave nicely towards each other , because that’s not what they do . Their response is to cut off their lips and to clamp on a padlock . To decide who should be in the Sanhedrin of the mind and who should be in the Sanhedrin of the soul , sit around and tell you what you’re allowed to say and what you’re allowed to think . They do not understand that there is not agreement about this . </s>
They seem to assume that somehow or other it will always prevail . </s>
Yes , they say times change , sometimes it’s allowed to be racist , sometimes it’s allowed to be anti-racist . Sometimes we silence the people who are pro-Jewish , sometimes we silence the people who are anti-Muslim , but that’s okay because we’re just rolling with the times , and we’re always going to let the people who we sort of think are civilized speak in the name of civility . I think that this is extremely dangerous . </s>
I return , that while they conclude that we must accept that because speech is limited we must put ourselves in charge of limiting it , that we are dealing here really with a case of lesser evils . The question before us tonight , simply put and simply stated in the proposition that we were given , is that freedom of speech must include a license to offend . </s>
I would expand that license to blaspheme , and I would not call it a license . They speak of it as a license , they think all speech is a license and that all speech should be licensed because most speech should be restricted before it is licensed . </s>
Then we decide , okay , we’ll let this out , we’ll let that out , we’ll let this out , we’ll let that out . I think that that’s a very , very , very dangerous precipice on which they want to perch us . I do not trust them , even though I think that they’re probably more trustable than most . </s>
But what is to say that they will stay in charge of that speech ? What is to say that we will not fall into the hands of somebody we don’t trust ? </s>
What is to say that the message that one day seems somewhat sane , the next day becomes to kill , and that the people who say let us not kill are silenced in the name of reasonable speech and in the name of civilization to moderate that . I remind you one last time as you go to vote , if you believe in chopping off lips and clamping on padlocks on open mouths , there’s your troika . That was Philip Gourevitch . Next , against the proposition , David Cesarani . Right . </s>
Well— First of all I want to thank Philip for repeating verbatim something I wrote in The Guardian . I stand by every word , and it’s saved me a bit of time . I do think it is possible for reasonable people , like the people in this room , to decide what is offensive and what is dangerous . Mari , in a very modest and less flamboyant way , tried to set out what it is that is offensive , and what is dangerous . I don’t think it’s really necessary to bother to respond to a very foolish idea of what this side of the house is advocating . </s>
We are not advocating cutting off people’s lips , we are not even advocating repealing the First Amendment . We’re not even advocating special laws that will have people banged up in prison for saying things that we don’t like . We’re just asking you , and I’m asking this as someone who’s British , to just reflect with a little humility on American society and culture . To reflect while holding in mind the fact that , in most other liberal democracies , there are modest constraints on what can be said and written . For good reason , too . </s>
Most international conventions that set out freedoms also include constraints on the freedom of expression , most notably the European Convention on Human Rights . The reason is that the European Convention on Human Rights that was passed in 1950 was framed against the background of genocide , mass murder , persecution , and totalitarianism in Europe . Men and women had seen the drip-drip effect there of hate speech , words that demeaned and degraded , and resolved that freedom of speech could no longer be considered an absolute right . It was a right , a fundamental element of liberty . But it was not absolutely overriding because it was open to abuse . </s>
It was abused in Europe , it’s abused now , and I’d say it’s actually abused here . Philip Gourevitch said rather mockingly that we came to you to ask you to get real . </s>
I’m going to repeat that . Get real . </s>
There was a little article in The Guardian which amused me . Apparently , a few days ago , a meeting to be addressed by a colleague of mine , Tony Judd , a historian who I rate enormously highly , was canceled because of a phone call from Abe Foxman . </s>
I don’t know if Abe Foxman is in this audience now , but he’s obviously a very powerful man . Just with the one of his voice he can have meetings canceled and freedom of expression curtailed . </s>
I think that is an abuse of power . </s>
I think that it is very dangerous that people can phone up organizations and have meetings canceled because they don’t like , not what the speaker is actually going to address , but other things that he has spoken about . Tony Judd has written some things about Israel that Abe didn’t like , so Abe phoned up the Polish consulate and said , do you really want to have that guy speak on your premises ? Now , get real . You have constraints on freedom of expression in this great country . What we are asking you to do is to reflect with a little bit of humility on how you want those constraints to be exercised by the most powerful , the most ruthless , the ones with the biggest bank balances , the ones with the most votes . </s>
Or do you want to have a public debate about how you protect those who are weak , who are vulnerable , who are defenseless , who are marginal , and who are often abused in the mass media or in work settings , as Mari mentioned . I think the real choice is not whether you’re in favor of absolute freedom of speech or constraints on freedom of speech tonight . </s>
It’s whether you’re going to be realistic , or whether you’re going to be smug and hypocritical and walk out of this hall thinking this is the land of the free , land of the brave , no such things as restrictions on freedom of speech here , and we don’t want to be lectured about that by some limey . Whether you’re going to recite to yourselves happily , Milton , Locke , Mill ! — without actually knowing very much about what Milton , Locke and Mill had to say about freedom of expression . For none of these men was freedom of expression a good in itself . It was always a means to an end . </s>
For Milton , who didn’t like Catholics , it was to expose the fallacies of Catholicism prior to crushing and eradicating them . For Locke , it was simply a means to good governments . For Mill , it was to advance education and truth . As soon as Mill considered the possibility of uneducated mass audiences , he panicked and resiled . </s>
He went back on everything that he’d said about unlimited freedom of speech . I’m going to read out what John Stuart Mill had to say . “Acts of whatever kind , which without justifiable cause do harm to others , may be—and , in the more important cases , absolutely require to be—controlled by the unfavorable sentiments and when needful by the active interference of mankind.” He included speech acts , and the notorious , wonderful example he gave is the folly of allowing a man in a time of famine to inveigh against grain dealers outside the home of a grain dealer before a public that is hungry , ill-educated , and not terribly reasonable . </s>
That unfortunately is the state of our society today . </s>
There are a lot of people who are unreasonable , who are ill- educated , who are angry about this and that , and there are plenty of people who want to stir the pot and who want to incite them . </s>
John Stuart Mill , who understood the perils of mass society , also understood that we are no longer conducting this discussion amongst a nice , homogeneous elite , but we are having to deal with huge numbers of people in divided , conflicted societies . I think—and I’m an optimist , unlike Philip Gourevitch—that we have it within our power , thinking and working together , to agree on what can and can not be said , should and should not be said , to avoid conflict , to avoid people standing outside the homes of grain merchants , and inveighing against their business . This is what Timothy Garton Ashe wrote recently in The Guardian . “We need to wake up to the seriousness of the danger”—the danger to freedom of speech , freedom of expression . “I repeat , this is one of the greatest challenges to freedom in our time . </s>
We need a debate about what the law should and should not allow to be said or written . Even Mill did not suggest that everyone should be allowed to say anything anytime anywhere . </s>
We also need a debate about what it’s prudent and wise to say in a globalized world where people of different cultures live so close together , like roommates separated only by a thin curtain . There is a frontier of prudence and wisdom which lies beyond the one that should be enforced by law.” </s>
We are , on this side of the house , advocating that you think about where that boundary of prudence and wisdom should lie . We’re not repealing the laws , we’re not passing them , we want you to reflect . Thank you . That was David Cesarani against the proposition . </s>
Now for the proposition , Christopher Hitchens . Well now , Mr. Chairman , ladies and gentlemen , brothers and sisters…if I may say , comrades and friends . Okay , then , “Fire ! ” It’s not that crowded a theater , but “Fire ! ” again . You see ? </s>
If you remember the appalling judgment actually rendered by Mr. Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes in that case , he was comparing the action that I’ve just imitated and parodied to the action of a group of Yiddish-speaking socialists who gave out a leaflet , in Yiddish only , opposing Mr. Wilson’s war and actually calling attention as they were to a major conflagration raging in Europe in which they did not think the United States should become involved . Be very , very , very careful when people give you arguments from authority or tradition that suggest that free speech can be limited by higher authorities like the sainted Holmes , because that’s what you’ll get . The end of it is a group of Yiddish-speaking radicals told they can’t hand out a leaflet in Yiddish on a major question of the day . That’s always how it will end , no matter how high-mindedly or creepily or sinisterly it’s presented to you . </s>
My favorite crowded-theater story is actually about the terrible Broadway production of The Diary of Anne Frank . Some people may remember this , it’s a production famous for its longueurs . </s>
In the third act as the German soldiers came pounding on the door and stamping into the parlor , someone in the front row shouted , “She’s in the attic ! ” </s>
Call me old-fashioned if you will , ladies and gentlemen , but as you will see I don’t think a joke is really a joke unless it’s at somebody’s expense . Now if you’re thick-skinned and broad-backed enough to take that , I might have a bit more for you . The real question , utterly , utterly dodged by David in his shady remarks , is this . Who’s going to decide . We’ve already found that Oliver Wendell Holmes isn’t competent on the point . </s>
Who will you appoint . Who will be the one who says , I know exactly where the limits should be , I know how far you can go and I know when you’ve gone too far , and I’ll decide that . </s>
Who do you think—who do you know—who have you heard of , who have you read about in history to whom you’d give that job ? </s>
I always say , just for this evening , I wouldn’t give it to anyone who’s spoken so far on the other side . Now , I sure do know a bit about Milton and quite a lot about Thomas Paine as well . Mr. Paine actually updated and I think improved John Milton’s Areopagitica which is the classic case for free expression . Those of you who know Areopagitica and Paine’s commentary on it will know that it recommends free speech in this way—not for you , but for the people you are listening to and the people whose comments you hope to hear in return , for your own education , for your own enlightenment and for your own elucidation . </s>
As Mr. Paine says , commenting on Milton , one of the vices of those who would repress the opinions of others is they make themselves prisoners of their own opinions , because they deny themselves the rights and the means of changing them . Should this not be as plain as could be ? The free interplay of ideas is not something that those of us who wish to speak or unload our opinions insist upon for that sake , it’s because we want to hear what is said in response , however unwelcome it may be to us . </s>
Thus the defense of any one opinion or form of expression is a defense of all of them . </s>
The classic statement in modern times of this , in my view , would be Aryeh Neier’s book Defending My Enemy where he describes the decision of the American Civil Liberties Union , of which I am a supporter , to take the case of the American Nazi Party and its right to parade swastikas through the town of Skokie , Illinois , a favorite retirement community for those who’d survived the final solution . </s>
The ACLU lost a lot of members on that proposition but we did the right thing by the First Amendment . In the book he has a wonderful extract from Robert Bolt’s play A Man for All Seasons which some of you will have seen at least in celluloid form , where if you recall , Sir Thomas More is talking to one of the witch-hunters and prosecutors . He says , “So you’d cut a road through the laws , would you , to get after the Devil ? ” The witch-hunter and prosecutor says , “I’d cut down every law in England to do that.” </s>
Thomas More says , “That’s worth knowing . And when the Devil turned round to meet you and had you at bay , where would you look for shelter , Mr . Prosecutor , the laws all being flat and cut down ? Where would you turn then ? ” It’s impossible ever to think of infringing the right of anyone else to free speech without arranging , in a sense calling in advance for this to happen to you too . It’s quite different , obviously different , from any question of information . </s>
Information may be classified and information may be copyrighted . Every word said on that score by the first speaker on the other side was a complete waste of her breath , because it’s not what we’re meant to talk about . We’re meant to talk about the expression of opinion and conviction , not breach of copyright or leaking of classified information . </s>
If we’d wanted to talk about that , we would’ve phrased the motion differently . There’ve been some bad signs lately , a lot of slippage in what I would have thought was the pedantic obviousness of the points I’ve just made . The imprisonment of David Irving in Austria for a thought crime , for the possibility that he might while in Austria have given a speech saying that he doubts some of the verdicts of history on what I call the final solution . There’s no victim to this crime . The Austrian consul called me up weeping with self-pity when I pointed this out in The Wall Street Journal and said , “But we thought finally Austria would be popular . </s>
We had something that you would all like ! </s>
So gut muttlich.” </s>
That the land that survives on the myth that Hitler was German and Beethoven was Viennese , that had Waldheim as its chancellor and has Jorg Heider as a member of its government , can revenge itself on a defenseless British academic and jail him is a standing disgrace . </s>
There are attempts to extend similar thought-crime laws to other topics of historical importance , the most depressing of which recently is the provisional decision of the French parliament to criminalize discussion of the Armenian massacre , considered by me and most others to have been a planned genocide in the early part of the 20th century . Now you couldn’t take the contrary view . You couldn’t for example argue , as you can , that actually in the provinces of Turkey where Russian forces were not engaged , Armenians were not massacred . In other words , it could be that it was partly an act of war as well as an act of ethnocide . </s>
Speculations of this kind would now be actually in peril . The law on which it’s modeled , the Loi Gayssot , which criminalizes in France discussion of the Holocaust as well , is named for the French Stalinist , Monsieur Gayssot , who sponsored it and whose spirit , and the spirit of whose hero is present in all of these and other such discussions . </s>
I stipulate that all of these things , when they happen , offend me very much . </s>
I’m offended by them , I want you to understand . It goes to the core of what I do and what I am . </s>
The First Amendment doesn’t just provide me with a living , the First Amendment is my life . </s>
When it’s infringed , I am offended , I have claimed the right to be offended . I do not claim the right to go burn down someone else’s place of worship , to threaten their religion with violent reprisal , to picket their home , to publish their name in threatening terms on the Internet—I won’t do any of that . </s>
It doesn’t mean I can’t be offended but it does mean that I’m even more offended by those who claim the right , not just to be offended , but to seek violent reprisal , as is so vividly and currently being done by the votaries of the prophet Mohammed , in recent instances which I have no time at all to inform you but about which you already know and to which I hope I will be asked to return . Thanks very much . That was Christopher Hitchens for the proposition . Against the proposition now , Daisy Khan . Distinguished guests , Philip , Signe , and Christopher . </s>
First of all , I think it was divine intervention that Christopher was not allowed to continue . </s>
I think Christopher should nominate me to decide who will decide , because really , Christopher , I’m quite fair . I definitely do not believe in cutting off lips , and I hate padlocks . So I want to begin by saying that the motion of today , where the freedom of expression must include the license to offend , is in a sense really a moot point and a moot question . </s>
I hope that all of you here today will consider rejecting and throwing it out . The freedom we have to express ourselves does in fact enable us to offend . Christopher is doing it all the time , in his own sweet way . In fact , one can even say that sometimes it is necessary to offend , and for good cause . The appropriate question to ask today is whether freedom of expression is absolute and limitless , or should it come with some social responsibility . </s>
In the US we do have a value system that undergirds our free speech . Salient within the system is the value of fighting the suppression of truth . Let’s face it . </s>
The reason why we’re having this debate today , is because a number of recent events , such as the Danish cartoon and Pope Benedict’s remarks on Islam , have brought this issue to the forefront . I’m mentioning these examples to frame the current affairs context for our discussion here today . </s>
There is no doubt in my mind that there are many issues , many suppressed truths , particularly within the Muslim world , that very badly need to be brought to light . </s>
I do not need to go through the litany of problems faced , for instance , by women in various parts of the Muslim world and the rest of the global South , all of which need to be discussed . There’s also no doubt in my mind that when it comes to religion , Muslims need to engage in a very honest and open discussion about many of the values that they espouse . Whether they are in accordance with the teachings of Islam is another matter entirely . </s>
There are , however , certain kinds of speech that undermine the very values that liberty of expression is meant to advance . </s>
Take for example the infamous Danish cartoon protest . </s>
To put it into context , we live in an environment—and this is especially true of Europe—where Muslims constantly face xenophobia . While the overwhelming majority of the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims do not partake in any violent actions in response to these political cartoons , a tiny , minuscule minority has grabbed the world’s attention and apparently now has absolute command of how Muslims are to be perceived . </s>
This is coupled with a time when a new generation of European-born Muslims have emerged that routinely face discrimination , alienation , and are often perceived as threats in their own countries . And all this while the violence in Iraq continues to surpass its already shocking levels . Clearly , we’re living in a very tense time . In such a situation , for a right-of-center Danish newspaper to come out with cartoons that show the prophet of Islam with a bomb in his turban , with a sword in his hand , and with a menacing look on his face does nothing , absolutely nothing , to advance desperately needed dialogue , or enlighten people in any positive way . If it does anything at all , it serves to suppress constructive dialogue by fueling extremist sentiments . </s>
It is important to note that this example has little to do with religion , though I think Philip and Christopher would probably tell you that’s the case . </s>
This isn’t about drawing the prophet , for which there are many historical precedents in traditional Muslim art . </s>
To see the situation clearly , we must all understand nuance . That’s what intellectuals are here for—for nuance , for teaching us the nuance . </s>
My Jewish rabbi friend called me right after the cartoon crisis and said , “What are you doing about the cartoons ? ” I said , “What are we going to do ? It’s just a cartoon.” He said , “No . Don’t ever accept it . </s>
This is what they did to us in Germany . They started with the cartoons”— Excuse me— Wait , wait . Come on , come on . </s>
No , that’s offensive . Well— That— That’s stupid . Well—no , come on , Christopher , no , no , Christopher , come on . </s>
Stupid , nasty— Christopher , come on . Daisy , this will not be deducted from your time . So when you publish cartoons which of course are a form of entertainment and hence immensely popular—and Signe , I loved that cartoon of the radical Islam contest—as a medium for conveying a particular message , or a speech is given by a person of immense power like the Pope , which further drives people apart and cements stereotypes , you’re using public discourse to malign the way an already marginalized community is perceived . </s>
This , my friends , is not in accordance with our foundational values of free speech . This is un-American . The point is not whether such things can or can not be published . But of course , they are published . </s>
Who’s preventing them ? The issue is whether there’s any wisdom in showing the prophet of Islam with a bomb in his turban no less . This is the sort of thing that furthers that familiar , yet dangerous and unsound argument , some Muslim men are terrorists , therefore , all or even most Muslim men are terrorists . Now this last statement is certainly something we can say , something that is enshrined in free speech . But is it true ? </s>
Is it responsible ? Does it elevate the public discourse ? Or is it simply racist , xenophobic drivel , that isn’t half as clever as it purports to be ? There are a few additional things to say . While modern technology has allowed us to improve our communication , it also means that ideas , news and statements can be disseminated at a global level very rapidly . </s>
The upshot is that the global distance is of little relevance in assessing how close we are to each other . So the notion of space , of sharing space with our neighbors , needs to be negotiated and reexamined . </s>
What is needed now is a heightened sense of awareness that enables us to distinguish between useful and useless affronts . Truly , few things are more useless than statements that exasperate bigotry and racism . Finally , in keeping with my previous point , I want to make a point about individual psychology in various societies . We’re always shocked at how people in the global South react vociferously , especially my people , Muslims , and at times violently , to what we see as simple free speech which may or may not undermine their value system . What we do not realize in our dismay is that in societies where the basics are not guaranteed , where one life , liberty , property , and family are not protected , individuals deal with disparities by developing a greater collective consciousness , where one identifies strongly with a larger community , in our case the Uma , and the collective values it represents . </s>
Something that is perceived to threaten or undermine those values are resolved not an individual level , but are resolved in a group dynamic which can sometimes result in chaotic mob reaction , which you’re all familiar with . In an environment defined by major uncertainties , heightened inequities , depictions like the Danish cartoons are perceived as yet another attack on what for some people sadly remain the final salvation—their dignity and their faith . And Signe’s right , religious people are the touchiest . It should come as no surprise , then , to see that— Daisy , that’s time . </s>
I want to just finish one last— </s>
Well , finish the sentence , finish the sentence . </s>
Finish by naming the rabbi . Stop— I want to know who that rabbi was— </s>
Sorry , we’ll get to that . We’ll get to that— Name that rabbi— </s>
Christopher— Name that rabbi— The rabbi is my secret weapon and I told him I would never do this . Ultimately , the question to ask is do we use our free speech to insult an already marginalized people ? Or do we use it to advance and enhance a desperately needed discourse between people living in an increasingly interconnected world . </s>
I hope you’ll throw out the other motion . Thank you . </s>
Okay . Thank you , Daisy Khan . All right , before we get to the questions , I’m now ready to present the results of the pre-debate vote . Before the debate , 177 of you voted for the proposition , 25 against , and 24 don’t know . </s>
So we’ll see if that changes . We’re now ready to begin the Q-and-A portion of the program . I will call on the questioners , and someone on each side of the auditorium will come to you with a microphone . Please stand when you ask your question , and I ask that you please make your questions short and to the point . Members of the press should identify themselves as such . </s>
Members of the audience who are not of the press can identify themselves or not as they see fit . Why don’t you , sir , ask the first question . </s>
My name is Barry Fredericks . </s>
I have a question . Have you all forgotten about Gallileo ? I mean this conversation about religious problems and insulting people , I mean , we’ve tried that case in the third century . </s>
Do we want to go back ? I notice there are groups in the Islamic world that’d like to go back to the 13th century . But do we really want to make that argument . </s>
Okay , that’s a good question . Who would like to respond . I’m for going back to the 13th century , personally . </s>
Yeah . Is that the question ? He was much on my mind as I came here tonight . But I thought , here I am , facing the anti-Gallilean forces once again… And I expected them to be very , very old , so this…very strange . Very strange arrangement . </s>
If I can— David ? Yes , the gentleman has repeated a hoary old myth about Gallileo . He actually was not persecuted— </s>
I find the word “hoary” offensive . —for his astrological discoveries . He was persecuted for various other things . He was patronized by the Pope , and he didn’t get into trouble with the Pope until he crossed swords with the papacy on completely different issues . </s>
That’s not true . He was— The next debate is about Gallileo , so— Read some history books that have been written within the last 30 years . I have . </s>
All right , why don’t we have another question ? Yes , ma’am . I just want to make the point , and I think this is directed at Daisy , who talked about racism and bigotry , and then just talked about her Jewish friend . You are against the motion to offend , and yet I think you offended most of the people in this room . If anybody has a comment on that , I’d like to hear it— </s>
Yes , I have a comment , I wasn’t offended . I wasn’t offended and I’m Jewish— </s>
My Jewish friend came to my aid and came to the aid of my community— Nor was I , actually , I was only pretending to be . I was just fascinated that she only had one . I don’t believe she has one . </s>
I want to know that rabbi’s name . It ought to be traceable . </s>
Could I suggest that she speak to some others , because really , it’s not a majority view amongst Jews , and to try and invoke her one Jewish friend to paint this majority view is quite preposterous . Now what you’re saying , Philip , is preposterous . Throughout Europe , the Jewish communities were very divided over the Danish cartoon issue . The European Jewish communities have— </s>
Well , let him finish— Hello— —been virtually eradicated— Let him finish , let him finish . Just a minute . </s>
David , go ahead . They live here , buddy . </s>
They live here now . No . David . A lot of the Jewish communities in Europe , including the Jewish community in Britain , and these views are articulated by the chief rabbi , Jonathan Sachs , who felt that the cartoons were not only offensive but were dangerous for the reasons that Daisy gave . Yes , because to many Jewish people that kind of demonization of a religion and a religious-ethnic group brought back some very sick and bad memories . That is why in Europe— </s>
Yes , of people burning books in the street— —there is a much greater tolerance of what this side of the house is advocating than on that side , which is displaying an extraordinary degree not only of disrespect but also of arrogance and an astonishing unwillingness to face a real past . </s>
I’m highly interested in facing a real past and that’s particularly why I feel that if your belief is that by muzzling Nazis you’re making us safe , I hope you’re not watching my back when they come back at us . I’m telling you the truth . If you think that there’s a mute button , and that by saying , oh , Nazis can’t speak in public , Nazis must be put in jail . We’re going to eradicate Nazism , rather than by having Nazis in a country where you can actually speak to them and argue with them , and not dignify them by putting them on trial every time they say something completely idiotic . You’re elevating Nazis and putting them down and then inciting a couple of politicians in Europe . </s>
It doesn’t dignify them . David Irving’s battle against Deborah Lipstadt exposed him for what he was , it was very effective . </s>
He had faced— He exposed himself for what was , he said the Holocaust didn’t exist and it did . If you were to eradicate all false history you’d have to stop all newspapers , it’s ridiculous . I beg your pardon . Faced by a prison sentence , David Irving courageously renounced all that he’s previously said about denying the Holocaust . </s>
The trial was very effective , and I don’t actually agree with putting people in prison for advocating Nazi propaganda and a version of The Protocols of the Elders of Zion because that’s what David Irving does . It’s not a kind of genteel rewriting of history which Christopher seems to think . It is the most poisonous kind of conspiracy theory— Why do I seem to think that ? </s>
Well , it’s what you said in your article— To the contrary . </s>
